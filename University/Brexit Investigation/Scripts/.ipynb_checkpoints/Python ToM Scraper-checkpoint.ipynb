Teresa May contrasts sharply with Shakespeare’s Henry V: one seeks to escape from the trammels of the European Union; the other encourages the Anglo Saxon motto to stand up and fight. “Once more into the breach... But when the blast of war blows in our ears Then imitate the action of the tiger; Stiffen the sinews summon up the blood…” That is exactly how the Empire was won; that is how Margaret Thatcher regained her usurped possession from Argentina. Like Henry V May has all the symptoms of a fighter but fighting the wrong battle is a danger that might even break up the United Kingdom. It is true that Britain like Germany and France had been taxed to the bone.\\xa0 Other laws had raised antagonism among the garrulous British constituents. Nevertheless May’s fight has degenerated against the enemy within. She is back to square one. Europe had done much to retain Greece in the fold. Britain would certainly have fared better. Britain’s intelligentsia ought to have opted for drastic reforms supported by countries of like mind. The disasters of two world wars and the tensions of Northern Ireland contrasted sharply with the blessings of a long peace in Europe.\\xa0 Wars are expensive disasters. However Britain’s unilateral decision was a challenge to all that Europe held sacred. Britain had been ensconced in the security of an iron shield of peace. Unfortunately Britain had succumbed to a small coterie of voters that had hardly envisaged the advantages that Britain stands to lose. A state of isolation demands expensive spending of additional defences. Dealing with trouble alone is certainly a bone of contention. All financial costs of war far surpass Britain’s grudging contributions. Besides Britain’s pride had always been in the universality of her language. Will all Britain’s pride gradually deteriorate in a Europe without Britain?

The current wave of scaremongering predicting dire consequences for Britain if the electorate vote for a ‘Brexit’ deserves and demands a balanced debate. At present the UK spends more than 10 per cent of its GDP on EU-related costs (this includes regulatory costs paying vast subsidies shoring up the protectionist Common Agricultural Policy health and benefit tourism and even discarding fish due to the quota system to name but a few). There is a sizeable number of people who believe that the EU has grown too large that it costs too much that it has eroded...\\n Write a letter to the editor and have it published in The Times or The Sunday Times of Malta newspaper. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Mr Collins said: “Let’s put the rhetoric hysteria and hurt feelings to one side” during the Brexit negotiations. But I ask: who is being hysteri\\xadcal? All the EU has said so far is that there can be no cherry picking which is stating the obvious. On the other hand it is the British government which has not yet agreed to guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in the UK. Also some British politicians seem to enjoy predicting that the EU is about the break up. How does that contribute to\\xa0 positive relations between the two sides?

After months of tough negotiations with Brussels to bring about a good Brexit deal very few Conservative MPs are optimistic that Prime Minister Theresa May could face down her harsh critics mainly led by Boris Johnson. Unfortunately and to my personal regret this will be a moment of high political danger for May because she may lose her job as Prime Minister. Conservative MPs in the UK have been putting spokes in the wheels for quite some time now. Their only desire is to topple her. They arrogantly slammed her Brexit deal by calling it a complete surrender to the EU. During a bruising session in the Commons Conservative backbenchers and former ministers branded the deal an absolute shame on May and the government she leads. In a bid to win support from British citizens May is making a desperate dash around the UK for her Brexit deal to be approved with one goal in mind: to deliver on the referendum in a way that brings the UK together again. Unfortunately for her there is a web of conspiracy by at least nine ex-ministers and several MPs led by Johnson manoeuvring to topple her. They are saying her deal cannot provide certainty to business because it is a huge gamble. The paradox at the heart of Brexit is only now becoming apparent. It was brutally exposed by Johnson himself when he handed his resignation. Everyone seems to be dissatisfied. No room left for reconciliation. Apparently the Brexit argument will continue forever.

It is irritating that some individuals keep on invading the pages of the Times of Malta to throw Brexit cowpats at all and sundry as did Paul Brincau (‘What independence?’ October 6) who took umbrage at the mention of “Malta’s Independence” by a contributor to these columns (September 28). In his letter Brincau fists flailing wildly censured the correspondent who dared mention the apocalyptic words “Independence Day”. To this end Brincau drew up a full artillery of tiresome recycled Brexit arguments about Malta having “lost control” over our courts borders laws taxation VAT trade armed forces and so on all as a result of our membership of the European Union. The simple reply is that Malta gained its independence on September 21 1964 when it ceased to be a British colony. It has now been an independent country within the EU for over 10 years and as a member state abides only by those European laws and regulations that were agreed upon during accession discussions. Dare one take the liberty of suggesting that Brincau and those others of Brexit persuasion in his entourage stop hanging their dirty linen in our newspapers and leave us in peace?\\u2008It would be much better for all if they conducted their squabbles where they belong – in some muddy field back home in that fair land which will soon cease to be part of the EU.

Paul Brincau (September 27) is entitled to his opinions but his gratuitously offensive reference to “slavish small states” within the EU is typical of the vitriolic and hectoring tone adopted by the pro-Brexit camp in the UK. Such an approach is frequently adopted by the desperate who know in their heart of hearts that their arguments are based on flimsy evidence and find themselves having to shout their opponents down. Referring to anyone who disagrees with pro-Brexit folk as “unpatriotic” “anti-democratic” or “remoaners” is typical of such pathetic nonsense. The fact is that none of the UK’s allies (with the sole exception of the populist and protectionist Donald Trump) agrees with Britain’s decision to leave the EU and neither does the UK business community. Be that as it may very sadly Brincau’s description of the UK as a “great country” may eventually ring somewhat hollow as it risks becoming an isolated commercial backwater. As a proud citizen of a “small EU state” and one also of the UK I should be sad to see that come to pass. Brincau might eventually reflect upon the fact that he along with his fellow ‘Brexiteers’ may actually be “Leave lemmings” as they blindly march to the tune of ‘dynamic duo’ Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage off a rather high and nasty cliff.

I understand there are strong anti-refugee sentiments bordering on violence in the Ħamrun/Marsa districts and elsewhere on the island due to the EU forcing its tiny insignificant slavish member countries to accept more refugees than they could manage.

However the trend that is developing as the Brexit vote approaches is evidently turning towards the ‘Out’ vote. And while neither camp is ready to commit themselves the ‘Out’ campaign are gaining confidence while the ‘In’ campaign are relying more and more on the undecided margin. Financial markets are exhibiting the uncertainty in the form of market volatility; which is expected to be the order of the day until the eventual result. Possible Aftermath Issues Possibly following a Brexit vote first out will be David Cameron and his disciples. An exit will probably re shape the political spectrum boosting UKIP sending the Conservatives into disarray and forcing labour to rethink their ideology. Scotland will probably call for a fresh referendum on independence from the UK in order to remain in the EU. Scottish independence following a Brexit is highly plausible. An integral part of the Northern Irish peace process was the opening of borders between The Republic of Ireland and Norther Ireland. The UK would have to balance between keeping an open border and a gateway for immigrants or closing the border and reigniting tensions. Britain will have two years to negotiate its way out of the EU. In the meantime current agreements will remain in place. At the core of the negotiations will be the free trade agreement. The post referendum debate will definitely include level of contribution required to remain in the free trade area. Many economists rightly retort “why all the hassle when the UK is going to continue contributing into the EU budget anyway.” Investment considerations Under the circumstances investors may consider; Playing the vote; investors may be convinced of the vote going one way or other. Investors placing their bets on ‘Remain’ may gain from converting cash to Sterling or buying European Equities before the vote. The opposite is true. Staying on the side-lines; experienced long-term investors are postponing investment decisions until the vote. Cash will be a valuable commodity if the ‘Out’ vote prevails. If the ‘Remain’ wins the positive reaction will be lost. However for the long term investor the short term movement should be negligible.

Following a speech by the Irish Prime Minister who said that Ireland will veto any movement that the UK will make to leave the EU and this follows a speech by Malta’s Prime Minister I now understand that Ireland and Malta are democratic countries but I wonder whether these people understand what democracy means? For their benefit allow me to say that democracy means implementing the will of the majority of the people and that is what happened in the Brexit referendum. Malta and Ireland are net benefactors and obtain more from the EU than they pay. On the other hand the UK is the second highest contributor to the EU and stopping such a big contribution to the EU must worry countries that take and not give. I belong to a group of 30 plus senior citizens who travel a lot (what else can we do) and in June we cancelled a three-week holiday to Malta - a trip we have made for the past 12 years - after the remarks Joseph Muscat made criticising the UK for leaving. Instead we went to Cyprus and had a fantastic time. We were planning a trip to Dublin in October but needless to say we are now looking for another destination.

Photo:\\u2008Marko Djurica/Reuters  The United Kingdom’s referendum a year ago gave the government the mandate to take Britain out of the EU. That was all. Voters did not say and were not asked whether they wanted to stay in the single market or the customs union. The new British prime minister to emerge from the wreckage of the Conservative Party after the referendum Theresa May has allowed MPs to ask questions about Brexit but has told them they have no right to decide the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU. The Tory press like the xenophobic Daily Mail cheered her on with asinine adulation. But the results of May’s ill-judged and badly conducted general election campaign has left her strategy in tatters. By the time you read this indeed she may no longer be prime minister. After the Brexit vote that nobody predicted and almost half did not want Britain faces the new nightmare of a hung parliament and a Prime Minister whose authority has been severely diminished. The Leave campaign was recklessly cavalier about how easy it was going to be to leave the EU. The reality is that disentangling Britain from a series of legal treaties is not one event but many. The Financial Times has calculated that it will need to renegotiate more than 750 agreements that the EU has with more than 160 countries covering fishing flying to the US trade agriculture nuclear power and far more. It will be a mammoth task even to replicate these arrangements let alone improve on them as Leavers claim. In the next 15 months Britain is due to dismantle an economy that has taken it over 40 years to build and which will take the next 25 to 50 years to recover. The full complexity of making bilateral deals to replace and extend the list of those already struck on Britain’s behalf by Brussels is only now coming into focus. The cost in lost trade pending such deals the cost to business of an abrupt end to free movement of labour for EU workers will be economically devastating. This election appears to have been among other things a rejection of the vague but harshly worded prospectus for a hard Brexit for which May sought a new mandate. She (or possibly her successor if she is ousted) needs to revisit that prospectus. The referendum a year ago did not oblige her to lead Britain out of the European single market and the EU customs union as well as the EU. As the detailed Brexit negotiations evolve especially on trade Prime Minister May’s Oxford degree in geography should stand her in good stead. For however contentious and complex these discussions end up the enduring reality is that the UK’s economic fate and future lie in Europe and not in some romantic ‘Global Britain’. The enduring reality is that the UK’s economic fate and future lie in Europe and not in some romantic ‘Global Britain’ Napoleon who knew all about power and geography captured the essence of geography. He wrote: “The politics of all powers derives from their geography.” Britain is a prisoner of its geography whatever some of its modern politicians believe. Britain is an island nation but has always had exceptional geography in Europe. This has enabled and protected Britain. It may arguably also have contributed to the ways in which it regards freedom and the law. Most certainly it spurred discovery necessitated trade to survive and demanded a spirit of commerce strength at sea and the development of statecraft. From these flowed Britain’s great history. For many supporters of Brexit this historical but now defunct construct survives even though time and global geopolitics have moved on and shifted away from Britain. Ironically it was precisely this shift that drove the UK’s integration into the EU economy 44 years ago creating an interdependence and a new identity which Brexit now seeks to weaken or if poorly implemented undermine. Roughly half of UK trade - which accounts for about 30 per cent of GDP on average - is done with the EU. The EU is the taker for virtually all the UK’s export categories. The bulk of British exports and imports is overwhelmingly concentrated in a group of countries that are less than 2000 kilometres from Britain’s shores. The UK trades with many countries that are further away but for the most part this trade is eclipsed by what happens closer to home. It is no accident. Geography matters. Leaving the largest free trade agreement in the world on Britain’s doorstep is a giant leap into the unknown. The more rushed the Brexit process proves the less likely it is to yield even an interim agreement. The British government should stop obsessing about trade and ‘Global Britain’ and argue instead for a transition arrangement in which exit from the EU would be less cliff-edge and more carefully phased over time perhaps over several years. It is going to be immeasurably complicated. This negotiation can only be done badly in two years. And it is probable that it cannot be done at all. On the current approach to Brexit it is likely that Britain will crash-land out of the EU in 2019 with no completed deal. It is hard to put a financial figure or describe the social disruption on the consequences of that. But it will certainly be large. Crashing out of the EU is in nobody’s interests least of all Britain’s. May would be wise to signal now that her plan is to seek a transitional deal prior to the comprehensive terms on which departure from the EU will be sought. It is entirely possible that Britain could successfully apply to join the European Economic Area (EEA) which is an agreement to secure the free movement of goods services capital and people between Iceland Lichtenstein Norway and the members of the EU. This would permit opt-out of those EU laws such as fisheries policy which the UK finds burdensome. But to join the EEA first would bring temporary certainty on commercial and social policy. Crucially it will also buy time to do a proper negotiation. The move would bring trouble politically from the head-bangers on her right though. The biggest challenge will be in explaining that EEA membership includes the free movement of people. There is a risk of being denounced by Leave zealots who fear a temporary deal will end up being the basis of a permanent settlement. That however is still much better than crash-landing with a considerable thud in 2019. Britain’s interests dictate the need to seal a transitional deal to take Britain safely away from the cliff-edge until the next election in 2022 which would be a more informed plebiscite on the outcome. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 13:52  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

When the Maltese finally waved the British armed forces goodbye in 1979 it never felt like they were getting rid of an alien oppressor. They continued to respect the English and have remained close ever since. The Maltese like the British and admire their level-headedness.

With obvious colours one side is predicting a pretty gloomy future for the UK while the opposite side is ready to embrace the opportunities that will emerge from the divorce. For readers familiar to the Maltese political scene this is starting to look similar to the all too familiar context taken from NET and SUPER ONE. UK you may possibly be leaving the EU but we welcome you to our ranks. In this club membership entails that that we are ‘very’ right and the others are ‘very’ wrong. Heaven is achievable only for the winners otherwise it will be hell. So just when the Maltese thought that they had reached an unassailable lead in polarisation here come our old masters to teach us how to go about it. Staying put The truth is that nobody knows what will really happen. In risk management language this is uncertainty and uncertainty is just another name for risk. Financial markets just hate uncertainty. If markets are expected to go down then everyone knows what to do. If Markets are expected to perform then we all know what to do. It sounds simple and it is. However when people have no hint in which direction to travel especially when you have no idea where you will end up either way the average guy will tend to stay put. In financial terms this means cash. Investments have been under pressure because people are hording liquidity and safety because both the opposing side of the argument have been depicting the alternative as hell. The outlook The UK appears to be unprepared politically for the outcome. The Conservative Party is left leaderless and the prospects that are lining up do not portray much confidence. The Labour Party’s leadership has been non-existent during the debate and its fate is now compromised at best. On the opposite front the EU bunch are clueless on how to handle the crisis.

However I notice that the people who are against Brexit often do not have any reason in their argument whatsoever just non-acceptance of the fact that Brexit will happen with hysteria thrown in. I have tried my best to ignore Michael Frank Owen’s anti-Brexit rants but last Sunday’s effort (‘Deal with Russia firmly’ The Sunday Times of Malta March 18) really takes the biscuit. Blaming Brexit for the Salisbury poisoning? Are you serious? Mr Owen is a typical ‘Remoaner’ who cannot accept the largest democratic vote for anything in British history. He will blame the recent bad weather on Brexit next.

Photo: Reuters  Britain\\'s next prime minister Theresa May has called for the country to unite under her leadership promising to make a success of negotiating the country\\'s divorce from the European Union. After receiving official confirmation she had won a leadership contest of the ruling Conservative Party following the exit of the only other candidate May told reporters: \"Brexit means Brexit and we are going to make a success of it ... we need to unite our country.\" May is due to be installed as prime minister in succession to David Cameron on Wednesday. She said she was\\xa0\"honoured and humbled\" to become new leader of the Conservatives.In a statement outside the Commons Britain\\'s next Prime Minister praised David Cameron for his stewardship of the party and country.Mrs May also hailed Andrea Leadsom whose shock decision to pull out of the Tory leadership race paved the way for her coronation for the \"dignity\" she had shown. Flanked by dozens of applauding MPs from all sides of the party Mrs May said she would offer \"strong proven leadership to steer us through what will be difficult and uncertain economic and political times\".She said that she would \"negotiate the best deal for Britain in leaving the EU and forge a new role for ourselves in the world\".In a message designed to reassure Eurosceptic Tories that her support for Remain during the referendum does not mean she will seek to go back on the vote to leave the EU Mrs May said: \"Brexit means Brexit and we\\'re going to make a success of it.\"And she added: \"We need to unite our country and ... we need a strong new positive vision for the future of our country - a vision of a country that works not for the privileged few but that works for every one of us.\"Because we are going to give people more control over their lives and that\\'s how together we will build a better Britain.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A number of Brexiteer Conservative MPs are recommending that European Union nationals should be charged £10 for a visa to enter Britain after Brexit. The EU also has the capability of determining whether Brexiteers should ever be allowed to enter the bloc. With the UK’s new Blue passport I am sure all Brexiteers will not worry should a large capital ‘B’ be stamped on page one. After all they are a proud sub-nation and would be prouder still if their allegiance was clearly stated on their passport. Of course the EU could then ponder the merits of allowing such patriots to cross their borders. They might of course worry that as Brexiteers hate the institution they might stir up trouble within the 27 remain countries. Safer by far to identify them and suggest they would feel much happier living with kindred spirits back on their home turf. If need be give them a one way ticket back to Old Blighty. Fortunately even the Brexiteers know by now that the UK will never leave the European Union. I have predicted before that this Conservative government will fall next year and will be replaced by a Labour administration.\\xa0 The latest polls show quite clearly that this will only happen if Labour hardens its anti-Brexit stance and consolidates its power base by maintaining traditional support and seeking moderate Conservatives and others to engage in tactical voting. It will have the youth vote heavily on its side if it distances itself completely from Brexit. So we shall end off with the disgruntled Bre- moaners who should regardless of a Labour victory be encouraged to keep well away from Europe. I am confident the European Union will discover the ways and means for that to happen next year once Jeremy Corbyn is Prime Minister.

It was always going to be difficult for British Prime Minister Theresa May to reconcile the ‘Remain’ and ‘Leave’ wings of her Conservative Party and to come up with a Brexit strategy acceptable to both. Last week she seemed to have done just that by persuading her Cabinet – during marathon talks at Chequers – to approve her latest blueprint for leaving the European Union. Two days later however the Chequers agreement which in effect proposed a ‘soft’ Brexit led to the resignations of foreign secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit secretary David Davis as well as a junior Brexit minister and two vice chairmen of the Conservative Party. This situation further weakened an already fragile government and gave rise to speculation of a leadership challenge to Ms May. Mr Johnson and Mr Davis stepped down because they felt the Prime Minister’s plan left the UK too closely integrated with the EU and did not allow a complete break. This is a view held by a substantial number of right-wing Conservative backbench MPs and it remains to be seen whether this hardline group of Brexiteers will continue to support Ms May. Ms May should continue with the Brexit plan drawn up at Chequers even though admittedly this endangers the survival of her government. Although Brexit is without doubt bad news and Britain can never be better off outside the EU than within as a member Ms May’s latest proposal moves away from the fanatical view of Brexit and aims at maintaining close economic ties with the EU. The Chequers proposal does not envisage the UK being completely out of the Single Market and moving away from the EU’s regulations. It proposes to “maintain a common rulebook for all goods” including agricultural produce after Brexit. And British judges will pay “due regard” to EU case law in areas where common rules are in force. Cabinet ministers also backed what they called a “combined Customs territory”. This outline is probably the most common-sense approach under a Brexit scenario and has been largely supported by British businesses to at least keep one foot in the EU. Of course it still remains to be seen whether Brussels will accept this latest proposal by the British government. While it is in the EU’s interest to conclude an agreement with the UK post-Brexit certain fundamental principles of the EU will have to be respected and no cherry picking can be allowed. Certainly any Brexit deal must not encourage other EU member states to believe they could be in a better position if they had to leave or that they would be allowed to pick and choose. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat is of course right when he says he hopes Brexit will not actually happen. Brexit is bad for Britain for the EU and particularly bad for Malta. The UK is one of this country’s closest friends and allies and has strong historic cultural and social links with Malta and its people. Thus it would be better for Malta were Brexit not to take place but if it does it is essential that Britain remains as close as possible to the EU leaving the door ajar in case one day its citizens decide to rejoin if/when they realise Brexit was nothing but an act of self-harm.

Photo: Reuters  Watching the Champions League the other night it hit me that no politician has been brave enough to deal with the really important Brexit issue. If God forbid the UK ends up with a bad deal do the Brexiteers realise that the top English football clubs may be forced to return most of their star players to their home countries? Do Boris Jacob and fellow anti-Europe eedjits (good Scots word for idiots) have the courage to go onto the field at Stamford Bridge Old Trafford the Etihad and all the other stadia and explain personally to irate fans that if the Brexiteers get their way most of the players will be forced to leave the UK plus the best managers in English football?

Big international banks are preparing to move some of their operations out of Britain in early 2017 due to the uncertainty over the country’s future relationship with the European Union a top banking official said. Writing in the Observer newspaper Anthony Browne the chief executive of lobby group the British Bankers’ Association said the public and political debate was “taking us in the wrong direction” and businesses could not wait until the last minute. “Most international banks now have project teams working out which operations they need to move to ensure they can continue serving customers the date by which this must happen and how best to do it” said Browne. “Their hands are quivering over the relocate button. Many smaller banks plan to start relocations before Christmas; bigger banks are expected to start in the first quarter of next year.” Many of the world’s major banks have their European headquarters in Britain where the financial sector employs more than two million people and makes up almost 12 per cent of the economy. Banks in London depend on a European “passport” to serve clients across the 28-country European Union from one base and lenders worry that this right will end after Brexit.Browne said while finance minister Philip Hammond and Brexit minister David Davis were “making the right noises” he was concerned that some high-profile Brexit supporters believed banks did not need passporting and could rely on so-called equivalence under which the EU can allow access to its markets for countries whose regulations are similar to the bloc’s. “The EU’s equivalence regime is a poor shadow of passporting; it only covers a narrow range of services can be withdrawn at virtually no notice and will probably mean the UK will have to accept rules it has no influence over” he said. “For most banks equivalence won’t prevent them from relocating their operations.” Banks have already said they are making contingency plans to move some of their operations to continental Europe if Britain does not negotiate access to the EU single market after Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May has said she would trigger formal talks to leave the EU by the end of March 2017 after Britain voted to leave in a referendum last June. She has said she would fight to retain access to the single market but several EU leaders have insisted that this will depend on Britain accepting free movement of workers from the EU – a condition Britain has vowed to curtail. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Of course they mirror my own but that is not why I am writing. I see a poll of hard-line Brexiteers reveals that: 1.39 per cent of Brexiteers say that losing their jobs will be worth the price of Brexit; 61 per cent say economic damage to the UK is a good price to pay for leaving the UK and 19 per cent of Remainers say the inevitable economic damage to the UK would be good as it would “teach the Brexiteers a lesson”. I respond thus. The 39 per cent of Brexiteers have never worked in their lives. The 61 per cent of Brexiteers who want to damage the UK economy are the same set of people who would have supported Adolph Hitler as he destroyed the Weimar Republic. The 19 per cent of Remainers are quite right to say we need to decline as a nation before we can ever arise again. Now I doubt the UK would go as far as to seek an alliance with America. Yet nothing is off the cards. The UK is so confused that anything can happen. However from this confusion a greater dawn will shine and through strife and disharmony the very idea of leaving Eurocare will become a horror of very distant memory. So let the lazy Brexiteers watch the telly and wonder why – in the months ahead – their benefits are switched off as economic reality bites.

Theresa May will shortly be brought down by the cross-party agreement to enshrine the Customs Union into law as a final condition of so-called Brexit. We will be paying tens of billions of pounds as a first instalment but then we shall be paying the EU what we are probably paying now as a fee to continue to enjoy the benefits of the Customs Union. The crunch time will be April. I said before there will be an election early this year as the Conservative Party implodes. Well it has imploded and with it the UK’s ability to negotiate. Great Britain has started a war on 27 fronts. A population of 60 million odd cannot overwhelm the power of 420 million people. Some Brexiteers still imagine Britain could cut and run and create separate customs treaties with other states. What does the UK have to offer trade-wise to the rest of the world? Little of consequence. The Labour Party will win the May election and will pick up the pieces as best it can. We have to hope the French will not do a Brexit in the meantime and ‘take back our borders’ throw UK Customs out of Calais and make the UK sort out its immigration problems on its own home soil. Then we shall need to build lorry parks in parallel with our motorways simply to help keep some trade moving. The only good news in all of this is that the EU budget deficit caused by a ‘hard Brexit’ will be avoided to a large extent and Britain will be saved the expense of paying British MEPs their bloated salaries as we shall play no part whatsoever in EU governance.

The million-pound question right?In the last three years I have not taken a position on whether I think Brexit is the right choice for Britain or not. Why should I? Should a Juventino take sides when watching a match between Man. United and Barcelona? Okay the tribal instinct is to settle old scores I grant that or to figure out with whom best to spar when one’s own tribe enters the arena. But that it is what it is really tribalism. I like to observe the process from a constitutional standpoint. Constitutional law is however never simple. If the people have spoken and the people are sovereign although the referendum was consultative I believe it is the right thing to do to respect their decision. The fact that the referendum process was seriously flawed does not in my view justify holding a second one at this stage. I say flawed because the people should have been given a clear option from the start to choose staying in the union with the new package that David Cameron had ironed out or leaving with a Brexit package that was clear; the same way Malta had voted on a specific package to enter the Union. But life is rarely lived on logical lines and we all know that a politician’s game tends to be more psychological than logical.\\xa0 The referendum was a choice on divorce. Usually the details of a divorce settlement come later and almost always after much acrimony and angst. But once you have crossed that Rubicon and opted for divorce there is no going back. The relationship would have changed irrevocably. Furthermore if the people of Britain are asked to vote again and choose to stay in the nation will be more divided than ever before. The Brexit voters would feel cheated. As I said it is never that simple. The referendum was a choice on divorce. Usually the details of a divorce settlement come later and almost always after much acrimony and angst Right now the Irish feel cheated. They want to hang on to the Good Friday Accord that had put an end to so much division and violence. Can you blame them? Can you blame the EU for standing behind Ireland which like all members would have a veto on the final divorce package anyway? You could hardly expect the EU to twist Ireland’s arm and kick it under the bus to satisfy the UK. The age-old Irish problem started by King James I who created an English settlement colony in Northern Ireland just to spite the Irish has come back to haunt the UK as it now seeks to leave the larger European Union. A case of national karma? It is also not that simple because Scotland is its own country with its pride and history and is vehemently against leaving the EU. It too feels cheated because it opted to stay in the British union only to find Britain now leaving the European one. It may well hold another referendum to decide whether to leave the UK in order to re-join the EU. Again it boils down to sovereignty. The UK has every right to leave the EU just as Scotland has every right to take another shot to leave the UK. Borders and frontiers are ultimately human constructs. It is those same humans who need to decide what borders they are comfortable setting for themselves. Their elected representatives should never deny them such a right. If they do it will just keep adding to the friction that is so prevalent in the geopolitical order today. Water tends to find its own balance. We could also artificially create bodies of water with dams but the power of gravity is relentless. In the absence of constant maintenance every dam will eventually burst and cause a massive flood. People too find their own balance left to their own devices. The British who would be happy to keep living in Britain would do so. Others may eventually choose to leave for Europe or some Commonwealth country. To each his own. And so it is with Scotland or for that matter even Wales. When the politicians are done with all their wrangling and manoeuvring it is the people who ultimately should decide the fate of the country they live in. Of course the tough part is that the majority decides for everyone. Howsoever a vote goes there is always going to be a large segment of the population that feels disgruntled. Being an outside observer I have watched Brexiteers and Remainers take shots at one another. That is human nature within the realm of polarisation. But essentially each side needs to show much more respect for the feelings and priorities of the other. They need to live together in the same country independently of the form that Brexit ultimately takes. Assuming that is that Brexit willeventually materialise in some way shape or form. I think the jury might still be out on that one. Rodolfo Ragonesi is a lawyer and researcher in history and international affairs.

Photo: Dylan Martinez/Reuters  Chancellor George Osborne said yesterday he would introduce an emergency budget if Britain voted to leave the EU but 57 of his own Conservative Party’s lawmakers said they would block his spending cuts and tax hikes. The escalation in the ruling party’s internal war over the EU raised the prospect of a government unable to operate normally in the event of a victory for ‘leave’ in a June 23 referendum on whether to stay in the bloc. With opinion polls showing momentum swinging towards ‘Leave’ the chief executive of aerospace and engineering group Rolls-Royce wrote to British staff warning that a so-called Brexit could result in important investment decisions being postponed. Osborne who along with Prime Minister David Cameron is leading efforts to keep Britain in said he would have to respond to a Leave vote with tax rises and spending cuts worth £30 billion. The one thing worse than not passing a budget like that is dealing with an economic tailspin Measures could include a two-point rise in the basic rate of income tax to 22 per cent and increases in tax rates and duties on alcohol and petrol while spending on health education and defence could be cut by two per cent. The official Vote Leave campaign hit back with a statement signed by 57 Conservative lawmakers who said they would block the proposed measures in parliament. The government currently has a working majority of 17 in the House of Commons. The opposition Labour Party which has 229 lawmakers to the Conservatives’ 330 would oppose the emergency budget its leader Jeremy Corbyn told the House. “The one thing worse than not passing a budget like that is dealing with an economic tailspin or the complete loss of confidence in the ability of the country to manage its money” Osborne said. Some independent economists said Osborne’s promise of a tighter budget after an ‘out’ vote could make it harder for Britain’s economy to cope with its uncertain future. “In the short run tax increases or spending cuts would be entirely the wrong response to a Brexit shock” Jonathan Portes principal research fellow at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research a think-tank said. An opinion poll published late on Tuesday showed the once double-digit lead of the ‘in’ campaign had narrowed to just one percentage point. Other polls have shown the ‘out’ camp ahead reducing the value of sterling and wiping billions of dollars off global stock markets. Markets have been increasingly jittery in the run-up to the vote and sterling has reacted sharply to some opinion polls. Housebuilder Berkeley reported a 20 per cent drop in reservations of new homes in the first five months of the year saying buyers were telling the company they were holding off until after the referendum. Osborne gave his speech alongside his predecessor as finance minister Labour’s Alistair Darling. The Vote Leave campaign rejected that assertion publishing what it said was a post-Brexit roadmap. This called for informal talks with EU countries ahead of a formal negotiation for a new EU-Britain treaty and immediate legislation to make emergency provisions for the transition period. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

It was a pleasant surprise to read David Hogg’s letter from Bristol (‘Brexit is the UK’s worst decision’ (The Sunday Times of Malta April 9). The letter was graphically and appropriately displayed. It was heartening to hear from a Remainer as so many have been bullied into silence with accusations of treason by hardline Brexiteers and their populist supporters who brook no opinions other than their own. It was also a pleasure to hear him recall the inspirational words of Guido de Marco about the young people from countries that were once enemies working and playing together in peace and friendship. Millions of people died in the two world wars and whole generations of young people were lost. Since The Treaty of Rome the European Union has brought about six decades (shall we say six generations?) of peace and prosperity. Our own country is a shining example of the beneficial effect of being a member of the EU. Ironically the UK also benefited greatly albeit reluctantly. Post-imperial nostalgia xenophobia and sheer misinformation resulted in the vote to leave\\xa0–\\xa0a heartbreaking outcome and yes a great mistake. Mr Hogg says that everyone thinks that Brexit is a done deal – but also opines that it is not. I agree. Scotland and Northern Ireland will have their say as will Gibraltar but equally importantly so will the 48 per cent of voters who wished to remain and one imagines many of the leavers when they realise they have been misled and are being led to a disastrous outcome. I suspect that well before the election which may or may not take place in 2020 there will be a huge reversal of public opinion when the impossibility of a good outcome for Brexit becomes apparent. If sadly the fanatics were to get their way then ‘Woe Britannia’ and we will weep for what was and what might have been.

Photo: Reuters  A great deal has been said about the impact of Brexit on Great Britain. But we very rarely hear about what the impact on the European Union would be. It is as if the EU could live happily without Britain if anything actually better. Brexit will provide opportunities for individual countries. Malta shall be no exception to this. The larger countries such as France and Germany may be hoping for a bonanza that is a significant shift of businesses from the UK more notably London to their countries. They could well be making one miscalculation – not fully understanding why these businesses were located in the UK in the first place. They can also be making another miscalculation. They do not recognise the number of times the opposition to the UK of certain proposals has saved the EU from itself. They may also not be recognising the extent to which the presence of the UK at the decision-making table has ensured more cost-effectiveness and less bureaucracy. Whether the lesson has been learnt or not is still to be seen. The first consideration to make is the currency issue. The UK had opted out of the eurozone. That made the group of member states that did not adopt the euro relatively strong because of the recognition of the pound sterling as an international currency. With Brexit such member states will no longer have the UK with them and so the euro group may push for certain changes that so far had remained opposed. Post-Brexit the eurozone would have more power to drive economic and financial policy in the EU regardless of the views of the member states that have not adopted the euro. This does not necessarily mean more integration within the eurozone especially since countries such as Italy are likely to oppose further integration. Moreover if Germany does not wish to continue bailing out individual countries it may also oppose further integration within the eurozone. The European Commission may end up being less committed on the issue of climate change post-Brexit Another consideration is energy. The EU has been pushing the agenda of a common energy policy. This was not much to the liking of the UK which had opposed the efforts of the European Commission to improve security of energy supply by intervening in the national energy markets. This is one of the tenets of a common energy policy. Without the UK the EU might adopt a more centralised system of energy market regulation. Moreover the UK has been more ambitious than other EU member states on the issue of climate change. So the European Commission may end up being less committed on the issue of climate change post-Brexit. Brexit could actually make the eurosceptic parties across the EU stronger. If this were to happen (for example in France and Italy) then one can expect a move towards less integration. The UK position had also had a significant impact in making sure that the budget spent on the common agricultural policy be reduced and that spent on research and innovation be increased. Would there be a reversal of this position post-Brexit? The UK had consistently pushed for more liberalisation both internally as well as externally. It was a big supporter for the removal of barriers to the trade in services. Would Brexit slow down this process and make the EU less liberal from an economic viewpoint? Would there also be a slowdown in the conclusion of agreements with third countries on free trade and would there be an increase in protectionism? Another consideration to make is the position that the EU will adopt with regard to macroeconomic policy in the Union. The German position has always been very clear – aim for a balanced budget. The UK although being in favour of fiscal prudence was not as orthodox as Germany was. Will Brexit increase the influence of Germany on macroeconomic policy in Europe? The outgoing German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble had said that Brexit would create instability that would be a poison to both the UK economy and the European economy. The extent to which this will actually happen especially in the EU remains to be seen. Then there is also the impact on Malta which we need to take into account. Thinking that Brexit will be a walk in the park for the EU and only the UK has something to lose from Brexit and the EU can only gain from Brexit would be very short-sighted. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

It’s been a turbulent few weeks in the Palace of Westminster and while Britons may all be bored silly by the sight of MPs arguing about what they think the people actually want the drama shows no sign of stopping. Since MPs first rejected the prime minister’s negotiated Brexit deal back in January in a shockingly large defeat we’ve seen MPs desperately try to take control of the parliamentary timetable. They have amended various business motions to try to carve out some parliamentary time (the government normally controls the agenda) to change the process by which parliament was considering Brexit. They wanted a series of different Brexit options (soft Brexit hard Brexit etc.) to be put before MPs in what’s known as “indicative votes”. This would give them an opportunity to indicate which options they support in the hope of identifying a way out of the impasse. Back in January they were successful only in forcing the prime minister to come back to the House with a Brexit update sooner than planned. When the final deal was put before MPs for a second time on March 14 MPs once again rejected it albeit by a smaller margin of around 150 votes. The government then let MPs vote on whether or not they wanted to leave the EU without a deal (they didn’t) followed by a further vote asking them if they wanted to extend Article 50 which facilitates the departure process until the summer (they did). This still needs to be agreed with the EU though. We also saw MPs rule out having a second referendum though this was largely because the People’s Vote campaign actually asked MPs not to agree to one right now thinking that it may be better to do so later on. It’s all a bit confusing made worse by the fact that divisions on Brexit fall both between and within the main political parties. We know that a majority of MPs don’t want the current Brexit deal negotiated by the prime minister but that they also don’t want to leave without a deal. So there is a majority in the House who are willing to consider a further negotiated deal. The argument now is really about what that new deal would look like and with the extension of Article 50 they have a little more breathing space to process it. Opposition and backbench MPs are still on the backfoot in this process and need the government to decide on the forthcoming parliamentary business or next steps. It looks like MPs will be asked to vote on the prime minister’s deal for the third time before March 20. EU leaders will be meeting in Brussels on March 21 which would be the moment to ask for an extension. There is some controversy about the third “meaningful vote” given that ordinarily parliament would not be able to vote on the same thing more than once. But these are no ordinary times and it will be up to the speaker of the house to decide whether or not to allow such a vote to go ahead. As we’ve seen several times already he doesn’t shy away from taking controversial decisions on Brexit. The government is hoping that more MPs will come on board to support the deal in a third vote. If they did the prime minister would go to the EU to request a short “technical” extension of the Brexit deadline. MPs have already agreed to that to enable all the necessary legislation to be passed. A Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill would then need to pass through the Commons before the extended summer deadline. If the third vote is lost things become more complicated. It may be that the government will allow MPs to have a further debate on the sort of Brexit they’d like to see or that MPs will continue to amend a government motion to propose alternative Brexit options. But we won’t really know for sure until we get a formal statement from the government about forthcoming business. One other thing that will almost certainly happen is that the UK will have to take part in the forthcoming European Parliament elections which are due to be held in May – not something which any political party has really planned on happening.

Theresa May’s speech the other day certainly flushed out more detail and more complexity regarding the next stage of the Brexit negotiations. One point she raised and which seems to have been missed is her idea for borderless trade post-Brexit. She suggested that small businesses in Ireland should fly below the radar and be exempt from the new customs tariff regime. I presume she intends to apply that principle across the European Union. For larger businesses she suggests that every importer and exporter of goods (services?) should be registered with the UK in a new cross border database. They would need I imagine to show their fitness to be registered as a ‘trusted trader’ and every subsequent lorry/truck/container would need to supply in advance information on the contents and the applicable tariff payments due. I imagine the new computer system would then generate bills to be paid to the UK Exchequer prior to entry. If this is acceptable then the European Union would need to create a similar system across all 27 remaining countries so it could raise applicable customs duties on goods (and services?) entering the EU. The Customs and Excise Department in Britain estimates that just for the UK it would take five years to establish such a complex system for frictionless trade. My question to Brexiteers is this: who will pay for this and what will we do before the ‘trusted trade’ principle converts to a computerised system? I wonder how the EU intends to emulate a similar system across Europe so it would receive the applicable tariffs due and avoid friction at the borders. It does seem odd to me that this new information simply slipped into what was a very detailed and erudite speech. Lost in translation or submerged in other complexities. We shall see.

At this early stage one can only guess what is likely to happen given that there are many possibilies. Britain may end up losing considerable influence at European and global levels and may experience negative economic and social ramifications.

What this country must do is ensure that relations with Britain following Brexit are as mutually accommodating as possible. Relations between the two countries extend to various aspects of health education tourism business and trade. All these areas are of vital importance to Malta. The present preparations by government entities and professional organisations need to be thorough to ensure a seamless transition to when Britain leaves the EU even if Tuesday’s vote by the House of Commons complicates things for the UK. Health issues being addressed include the importation of 1870 medicinal products and the treatment of Maltese patients in UK hospitals under a health agreement signed in 1975. Malta like other EU countries has to find alternative sources of medicine to ensure that patients are not negatively affected should Brexit become a reality in the next few weeks. It is essential that the new sources provide similar medicine at similar prices in order not to impact consumers negatively. Malta has long held strong ties with the UK in education. Many doctors and other professionals have trained in British medical schools and universities. At the same time British doctors have practised medicine in Maltese hospitals in the past and continue to do so now. The Prime Minister has already noted that Maltese doctors trained in the UK would be recognised according to existing arrangements. Moreover the proposal that Malta and the UK plan to mutually recognise each other’s doctors is welcome. Equally comforting is the proposal that the Medical Council would introduce a fast-track system to register professionals from the UK. The UK market remains crucially important for Malta’s tourism industry and about 13000 Britons live here including 5000 workers. British residents who retire on the island are an important source of income for service providers and they need to be reassured they will continue to be welcome on the island even after Britain leaves the EU. The granting of a 10-year residence permit is a good move that should help to persuade more Britons to retire in Malta if they so wish. Equally important is the ability of Maltese citizens to continue to travel to the UK as tourists with as little hassle as possible. Few deny that the most likely impact of Brexit on the remaining EU countries will be in the area of trade. When the UK no longer forms part of the EU internal market import taxes and tariffs may hinder the flow of goods between the EU countries and the UK. E-commerce has become so popular that many ordinary people are likely to be affected when buying goods online from UK companies following Brexit. Malta Customs would have an additional 6000 to 7000 declarations to handle in a no-deal Brexit scenario. It is therefore essential that both Malta and the UK introduce processes that respect the legal realties of the new trading situation while encouraging trade to continue to flourish and flow easily. Malta will lose an important ally in its insistence on sovereignty on fiscal matters that are being challenged by major EU member states. This political issue is likely to be the one that will have the greatest impact on Malta post-Brexit.

Photo:\\u2008Francois Lenoir/Reuters  A year ago today 52 per cent of the electorate in the UK voted for the country to leave the European Union. Last Monday the formal ‘withdrawal’ negotiations kicked off in Brussels. This first session was described by Michel Barnier the European Commission’s chief negotiator as “useful to start off on the right foot”. Agreement was reached on dates on organisation and on priorities for the negotiation. The negotiation will basically be divided into two parts – the first will cover the most important and pressing aspects concerning the withdrawal of the UK from the EU whereas the second will seek to shape the future relationship between the two sides once Brexit has happened. Citizens’ rights the single financial settlement and other ‘separation issues’ will be tackled in the first phase with one week of negotiations taking place each month. The financial settlement includes the so-called ‘Brexit bill’ – what the UK will have to pay the EU. Contrary to how it is often presented the financial settlement is not a fine or penalty imposed on the UK because it wants to leave but represents what the UK actually owes the EU.\\xa0 The ‘Brexit bill’ is about the UK respecting in full the financial obligations resulting from the whole period of its EU membership. It was also agreed that a dialogue on Ireland would start aimed at protecting the Good Friday agreement and the maintenance of the Common Travel Area. Concluding after the first session of negotiations Barnier said his state of mind was similar to that of Jean Monnet who when once asked whether he was optimistic or pessimistic replied “neither one nor the other – I am determined”. Since the UK electorate voted for Brexit a year ago the political context in the UK itself and in other parts of Europe and the world have changed significantly. The first casualty of the vote was the very person who pushed for it – David Cameron. He was succeeded as prime minister by Theresa May who seemed to adopt a hard line possibly to justify the fact that she had gone from being a pro-Remain politician to one who was aspiring to lead the country out of the EU and reassert its role as a major global player. The door remains open always open until the Brexit negotiations come to an end – President Macron To me she sounded at times like someone who was almost going overboard to convince herself and her compatriots that she had converted to the cause of the Brexiteers. May also did what she initially had said she would not do – call a snap election. Having a small majority in the House of Commons and sensing that the tide in the country was in her favour given that opinion polls were predicting a landslide victory for the Conservative Party she went to the polls three years before they were due only to lose her absolute majority. She has formed a minority government which is dependent on the support of the 10 Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party MPs. On Wednesday Queen Elizabeth II delivered her speech at the state opening of Parliament in which she outlined the government’s legislative programme for the next two years. Normally it would be a one-year programme however the minority government felt that a two-year period would facilitate Parliament’s ability to properly scrutinise the Brexit negotiations. The opposition parties on the other hand claim that May fears that once the negotiations are underway and the going gets tough she would not be able to pass another Queen’s speech in a year’s time. The vote on the Queen’s speech is expected to take place on Thursday and it amounts to a vote of confidence (or no confidence) in the government. Irrespective of whether the minority government will survive the pressure for a ‘softer’ Brexit than that which May was pushing for prior to June 8 will increase. DUP leader Arlene Foster said the UK should retain as many of the benefits of the Single Market as possible and avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The Labour Party which defied all odds and increased its share of the vote obtaining 40 per cent of the vote (the Conservatives won 42.4 per cent) wants a much closer relationship with the EU than May did before June 8. Labour has also rejected the ‘no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain’ option that had been stated by May in January meaning that it would not contemplate walking out of the negotiations with the EU. The negotiations are now underway. The treaty on European Union states they should be concluded within two years from the moment Article 50 was triggered that is by March 29 2019. Should no agreement be reached on that day the EU treaties would simply stop applying to the UK unless the Council of the Union unanimously agrees to extend the period until an agreement may be reached. Any agreement must be approved by a simple majority vote in the European Parliament (including MEPs from the UK) and concluded by the council acting by qualified majority. It would also be necessary for the UK itself to ratify the agreement in terms of its own constitutional norms. On the other side of the channel there have also recently been elections. In May Emanuel Macron won the French presidency after having campaigning on a strong pro-EU platform. Parliamentary elections held in France last Sunday have resulted in Macron’s new party commanding a comfortable majority in the national assembly. Meeting May in Paris on June 13 Macron said when asked about the possibility for the UK to remain in the EU that while respecting the sovereign decision of the British people “the door remains open always open until the Brexit negotiations come to an end”. Just a few hours earlier Germany’s Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble had said something similar: “The British government has said we will stay with the Brexit. We take the decision as a matter of respect. But if they wanted to change their decision of course they would find open doors.” Much has occurred since the Brexit vote and a lot more may happen before the end of the negotiations. However the EU seems to be in better shape than it was a year ago. This does not mean that all problems have been solved. However one thing is certain – the much feared domino effect of the UK vote does not seem to have occurred and the demise of the EU predicted by the likes of Donald Trump Nigel Farage and Marine Le Pen appears destined to remain mere wishful thinking at least for now. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

It has been two years six months and 12 days since that day on June 4 2016 when the world awoke to the news that the people of the United Kingdom voted for a break away with the rest of the European Union. Divorces are complicated and messy at best and if this is to be compared to one it can be considered as the mother of them all. After delaying the initial parliament vote in December in favour of trying to extract further concessions from the European Union the day of reckoning on January 14 delivered the inevitable blow to Theresa May’s Brexit deal.\\xa0\\xa0 During last year’s snap election the Labour party came back from its relative obscurity that grappled the party post the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown heydays. The prospect of the Labour party possibly endorsing a second referendum has galvanised support and mobilised many disenfranchised youths. However the party’s leader Jeremy Corbyn has come short of endorsing a second referendum making the Labour party’s position unclear in this respect. It is of paramount importance that the British people are given a clear way forward in this regard. Both Conservative and Tory parties have a proportion of representatives in favour of Britain remaining despite these have decreased in their numbers after the 2016 referendum. On Wednesday 71 Labour MPs have publicly come out endorsing a second referendum citing that the British people should be given another vote following the revelations of these past two years people may have changed their minds on wanting to exit the EU in the first place. However party leader Corbyn considered by some as a Eurosceptic himself despite having voted to stay in the EU on the basis of the party line may actually fancy a hard Brexit. It is becoming clearer that the future of the British exit from the EU hangs on the will of their British parliament. Despite rejecting the Brexit deal by a wide margin on Tuesday parliament has subsequently rejected by a narrow margin the vote of confidence tabled by the leader of the Opposition Corbyn. This distils the current situation as one whereby parliament rejects the proposed Brexit deal but intends to stick with its Conservative coalition and also its resilient leader May. This merely reflects the will of the slim Conservative majority to hold on to power and in their while at the same time not willing to endorse the proposed Brexit deal. It is true that no one knows what is going to happen in the coming weeks months and years. Markets coupled with uncertainty are a recipe for volatility During an address from 10 Downing Street May fresh out of a no-confidence vote claimed that she wants to reach out to all parties in parliament to work on a Brexit deal they can follow through a vote. Reaching across the aisle may be the prime minister’s ultimate effort in trying to secure this deal. It remains unclear what changes can be made in the few weeks remaining till the day of March 29 that would appease the 230 MPs that rejected the deal. Given the chain of events we shall expect in the coming weeks a series of cross party negotiations including coalition partners and members of the opposition. These negotiations will not include the main Opposition party the Labour party which has disagreed to enter into talks unless a no-deal Brexit is put off the table. However such position hinders the ruling Conservative majority from working towards a deal in the first place increasing the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. Also it is unclear what further concessions can be made from the European Union which has made it clear that no further improvements can be made to “sweeten the deal” for British MPs to vote it through parliament. This creates a situation of a further deadlock for the United Kingdom which will only result in further escalation in the coming months. This leads us to think in terms of timelines. The cross party negotiation will take time until a strong enough consensus can be formed about the type of changes to the existing deal the UK parliamentary majority would want to ratify the deal. This would then see the British Prime Minister flying to Europe to try and clinch these modifications and have them approved by the European Council. Being a large bureaucratic organisation this will also take time and given that the EU is highly unlikely to accept terms that may jeopardise its members such as Ireland Gibraltar and Cyprus the Prime Minister may find herself in a vicious cycle. From the timelines it looks possible that the UK would have to demand an extension from the agreed date of March 29 to avoid a potentially devastating hard Brexit. This could also mean that the UK would have to hold European MEP elections as all members of the EU are due to vote their parliamentary representatives during the month of May. At the same time the message towards a second referendum may gain further traction against the resolve of the Prime Minister to deliver her Brexit. The Prime Minister for all her talk that the British people clearly demanded Brexit in their referendum may be constrained to go to yet another referendum if she cannot muster a majority to vote towards some sort of deal. It is true that no one knows what is going to happen in the coming weeks months and years. Markets coupled with uncertainty are a recipe for volatility. Regardless of the outcome trade flows and business activity will at some point adjust to a new normal. Despite that a new normal could look different from the previous relationship trade will ensue people will still come and go. What we are unsure of is the framework under which this will be conducted. Whether it is a full-blown hard Brexit on one side or a possible second referendum which could make the last two years look like just a bad dream there is a strong argument that investing in the UK is an attractive value proposition. Long-term investors who have weathered this market turbulence should hold on to their investments since markets have already priced in a worst case Brexit scenario. For such investors it may be the right time to evaluate whether the British market could present an opportunity to average down their investment cost. This should be always done by selectively evaluating the options on the market with a professional financial advisor.

The next generation of business students and budding politicians will spend endless hours reviewing the process of the negotiation strategies that Britain and the EU will be adopting in the next two years and possibly beyond that to strike a new agreement that will define the post-Brexit era. Business students of my generation may recall the scanty training we received in the art of business negotiations. I remember distinctly the amusing bestseller business book entitled Everything is Negotiable by Gavin Kennedy a practical guide on how to negotiate the best deals. The EU and Britain must be honing their negotiating strategies in the next few weeks to create the best chance of achieving their objectives. The media will speculate on how negotiations will be progressing over the next two years. Emotions will risk blurring the vision of negotiators on both sides of the table. Politicians will often be forced to say one thing in public to appease home audiences and agree on something quite different to ensure that ultimately they strike a deal that achieves most of their objectives. They should not find a problem doing this as politicians are experts at saying one thing and then doing something quite different. I believe the EU starts these negotiations with a slight advantage. The Brussels bureaucrats are very experienced in negotiating deals – even if at times their negotiations do not lead to any useful conclusion. Turkey for instance has been negotiating to join the EU for over 50 years and it has now reportedly given up. Trade policy will whether officially or unofficially top the agenda. Britain will want to get the best trade deal with the EU despite the fact that British business have generally not supported Brexit. Theresa May is sending delegations to every corner of the world to prove that bilateral agreements are still doable when Britain leaves the EU. But today’s world is dominated by trade super-powers. There are 318 million consumers in the US and 437 million in the EU single market while the UK has just 67 million consumers. To succeed in striking a good trade deal the UK needs to rope in the same business leaders that opposed Brexit Replacing agreements between trade superpowers with bilateral agreements with Commonwealth and other countries is likely to be the most important challenge for Britain in the next few years. So even though not admitting it publicly the British Prime Minister will have to struggle to avoid agreements that depend on concessions from the UK for example of the free movement of people in the post-Brexit period. It is after all businesses that create real sustainable jobs and not politicians. To succeed in striking a good trade deal the UK needs to rope in the same business leaders that opposed Brexit. The EU has equally challenging tasks ahead of these negotiations. A final Brexit treaty will have to be approved by a complex process that sees the European Parliament and the European Council trying to achieve some form of consensus amongst 27 member states who have very different domestic objectives. The EU’s complex voting process defies any attempt to bring these negotiations to a quick end as both parties would prefer. Yet the biggest risk that these negotiations face is one or both parties deciding to walk away from the negotiating table at a time when no deal is perceived to be better than a bad deal. Political moods may change in both the EU and the UK. Britain is still almost equally divided on the issue of leaving the EU. If the British economy starts to suffer in the coming two years the electorate may blame political uncertainty caused by the Brexit decision. The effect of thousands of non-British workers leaving the National Health Service or UK companies setting up their head offices in EU countries is enough to send shivers down the spine of the UK establishment. The EU’s political instability is no less troublesome despite the bullish declarations of EU leaders when they meet for their regular jamborees. It is clear that the interests of major EU members like Germany and France are very different from those of Hungary Greece and Poland. Ultimately it will be Germany and France that call the shots. But if the agreement is not backed by a broad majority of member states the UK may well decide on a hard Brexit ‘pure and simple’. johncassarwhite@yahoo.com \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

She may even go down in the history books as the PM that could not prevent the breakup of the United Kingdom. Only time will tell whether that is the legacy she would have wanted to leave behind. The moment is also historic in that it is the first time that a country has formally started the process of leaving the European Union. Brexit is Brexit. That is what May said and that is what will take place. Article 50 will now be formally triggered on May 29. Prime Minister May has over the past few months been working hard to convince one and sundry that she will make Britain great again and that through Brexit she will secure a bright and exciting future for her country. One has to wonder whether she is the siren leading her country to shipwreck. Beyond the political opium however lies a harsh reality where the UK will struggle to negotiate the deal it needs with what is after all their most important trade partner and upon which hundreds of thousands of jobs depend. PM May has gone on record as saying that she is ready to walk away with no deal if the deal on the table is not good for the UK. She may well regret such bluster when over the coming months details of the negotiations start to trickle through and every UK citizen and of course every tabloid will be judge and jury as to whether the deal is good or not for the UK. It is clear that with the ‘good deal or no deal’ statement May wanted to set a marker at the start of the negotiations process but in actual fact that marker was set out months ago immediately after the Brexit vote when the other 27 EU heads of state clearly stated that the UK cannot be given a better deal than actual EU membership. The logic of such a stance is obvious and it is with this logic that May and her government must now grapple. The EU is there to give its citizens a better quality of life. It is there to serve the people and not the other way round The other bull in the china shop is Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon Scotland’s First Minister has left no doubt that she is going for the jugular. She is determined to call a second referendum. It is now a question of ‘when’ rather than ‘if’. She said that in spite of May’s initial promises of partnership central government has not ‘moved one inch’ in that direction. Sturgeon sees Scotland’s place in Europe and more importantly in the Single Market as critical for the nation’s future. There is no doubt that the last thing May needs while grappling with Brexit is a full-blown battle with an equally headstrong Sturgeon. This however now seems inevitable and the possibility of a breakup of the United Kingdom is a closer reality. This is yet another twist in what promises to be a long and winding tale. Can anyone see the EU not rushing to give EU membership in record time to a newly independent Scotland? There are of course implications for the EU as well. There is no denying that the Brexit vote has emboldened the far right parties in Europe. Thankfully sanity made something of a comeback with the far right being defeated in the recent Dutch elections. However we are still facing a volatile situation in France and to a lesser extent in Germany. A win for any of these parties in the forthcoming elections will without a shadow of a doubt have huge implications for the EU as it stands today. There are many who see Brexit as already being potentially fatal for the EU. Others such as myself see Brexit as the perfect opportunity to take a good hard look at the EU and to undertake well overdue reforms. Such reforms must be guided by a simple cold logic – the EU is there to give its citizens a better quality of life. It is there to serve the people and not the other way round. The old established way of doing things has to be challenged. All this must be done keeping in mind that the core values of the Union those of solidarity freedom human dignity and equality are just as valid today as they were 60 years ago. Which way such reforms will go is anyone’s guess at the moment. What is certain however is that Brexit has been unleashed and this may well have implications that will shake Europe to its very core.

European stocks slipped again and sterling and the euro remained volatile yesterday as one of the most dramatic twists yet in the Brexit process compounded another turbulent week for world markets. London Paris and Frankfurt struggled to maintain a modest early bounce having been battered the previous day when Britain’s Brexit minister quit in protest over a draft deal with Brussels on leaving the European Union. Wall Street tech stocks looked set to take a hit with Nasdaq futures pointing more than 1 per cent lower as disappointing results from United States chipmaker Nvidia Corp hit the chip sector globally. Sterling faired a little better than on Thursday when it slumped more than 2 cents versus the dollar in what was also its worst day against the euro since the post-Brexit vote fallout of 2016. But with reports of a UK political coup still rife and a fear that the country could crash out of the EU without a divorce deal it couldn’t get much beyond 88.50 pence per euro and $1.2875 on cable. UK and euro zone government bond yields edged up as some stability returned to fixed-income markets. Still 10-year yields on German bonds considered one of the safest assets in the world were set for their biggest weekly fall in three weeks in a sign that Brexit uncertainty and worries about Italy’s finances continued to support demand. In Frankfurt the head of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi said the bank still plans to dial back its stimulus at the end of the year but acknowledged the economy had hit a soft patch and inflation may rise more slowly than expected. “If firms start to become more uncertain about the growth and inflation outlook the squeeze on margins could prove more persistent” Draghi told a conference. Some of Europe’s biggest funds who took part in a Reuters summit this week said they now think Mr Draghi will be the first president in the ECB’s history not to have raised interest rates during their term. Europe’s tech stocks suffered but Brexit remained the region’s main focus. Fears that UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s hard-fought deal could collapse had sent British markets into gyrations not seen since the June 2016 referendum on EU membership. Britain’s FTSE 100 was at a three-week low down 0.85 per cent with FTSE 350 bank stocks down 1.4 per cent as lender RBS slid a further 4 per cent. In commodity markets the weaker dollar gave gold a leg up to $1223. Oil prices rose too helped by a decline in US fuel stockpiles and the possibility of a cut in Opec output. United States crude was trading up 80 cents at $57.27 and Brent crude rose roughly 1 dollar to $67.65 a barrel. It was still set for a sixth straight weekly loss however. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  A few weeks ago I wrote in this paper that EU member states should support the UK government Chequers plan. Today this does not seem to be viable any longer. It now seems likely that support for the plan has holes the EU will not countenance and it might have no majority in the UK Parliament. All largely due to the impossible contortions necessary to square Chequers with a politically and practically viable solution to the Irish border question. As we head to the Brexit end game with only one or two months to go to find some kind of solution it seems to become increasingly difficult to square everyone’s competing demands and red lines. In the UK the atmosphere is so feverish that nothing seems possible to achieve – not a compromise deal not a no-deal exit not a people’s vote (a second referendum) not forcing of a new election. Each of the options constructs a different jigsaw of interests ideological beliefs and practical problems. None of the jigsaws seem to result in a parliamentary majority. On the EU side I would not be surprised if the overwhelming feeling now is one of boredom and frustration with the whole darned process. A feeling shared by many British citizens. In June 2017 after the last British election we wrote a paper suggesting that the EEA/EFTA option would form a practicable off-the-shelf approach to a time-limited transition period post-Brexit. We called the paper ‘A very British Brexit’ believing foolishly as it turns out that the British spirit of compromise and pragmatism would eventually win out – especially in circumstances where the governing party did not have an absolute majority. At first nobody paid much attention to our paper. But eventually a group of UK politicians supporting that option emerged. Some believed that it would be a good temporary option. Others more Europhile in their inclinations wanted it to be a permanent arrangement. I suggest that it might be time to revive discussion of this option: an agreement for a clearly time-limited British membership of EEA/EFTA plus membership of the customs union for a period of say three to five years. All part of a three stage EU-UK disentanglement process that we lay out in the paper. Some will argue that Prime Minister Theresa May has clearly excluded such an option. True. But Mrs May in her Lancaster House speech had seemingly shooting from the hip excluded many things that eventually found their way into Chequers. And now she is faced with an impossible parliamentary arithmetic and very few remaining options. In such a situation people tend to be slightly more open to changing their minds. I wouldn’t be surprised if the feeling now is one of boredom Why could the EEA/EFTA transitional arrangement work? As we outline in the paper it maintains the status quo for frictionless trade – both in goods and services. It is a better option that Chequers because through existing mechanisms it allows the UK to have some influence on EU policy – a better situation than what Brexiteers call the ‘vassal state’ condition envisaged in Chequers where the UK is bound by EU rules while having no say. The UK would exit the Common Fisheries Policy and the Common Agricultural Policy – both much disliked (and not only in the UK) as well as excluding foreign and security policy justice and home affairs direct and indirect taxation and economic and monetary union. There would be no more ECJ control over the British legal system and through Articles 112 and 113 of the EEA agreement Britain would gain the right to the use of an emergency brake on immigration – albeit on a temporary basis. And of course during the period in question the Irish border would not be an issue. This option also meets the Labour Party’s tests on what kind of Brexit they would be willing to support. When the temporary membership expires the UK would exit the EEA and the customs union. What of the Irish border at that time? Well hardcore Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson are seemingly convinced that technological solutions can create a border that is as seamless as it is today. The proposed solution would give everyone five years to implement these tech solutions and test them in the field. If they work as Mr Johnson confidently keeps assuring us they will then it’s no problem at all. Of course it is not clear that either exhausted party to the negotiations would at this stage countenance the idea of initiating a discussion from a different starting point. And as one friend put it to me today the whole EEA/EFTA transitional option is far too logical and rational to get any traction in the current British political climate. It’s therefore not clear that this option can be revived. Encouragingly however some Tory Brexit-favouring MPs have started putting it forward and former foreign secretary William Hague recommended it in a recent article in the Telegraph. That said we might have to wait for British parliamentary deadlock to emerge before alternatives will be considered. Now that everyone seems to have painted themselves into a corner from which there seems to be no easy exit would it help or hinder if Mr Barnier and EU Member States formally put this option forward? I have no idea.

The word ‘project’ is not incidental since the Common Market of just nine countries the UK joined back then has transformed into a 28-member bloc with greater political and economic integration. The UK has always been a reluctant partner to this European project that grew wider and deeper over the years. This was evidenced by the exceptions rebates and opt-outs the UK negotiated and defended jealously at every turn. And yet British voters fanned by decades of Brussels-bashing by their politicians decided they had enough. Their decision of course has to be respected. For all the acrimony and half-truths exchanged in an intense campaign that split the country down the middle the Brexit referendum was an exercise in democracy. At the end of the day the people defied the political leaders of all the UK’s mainstream parties ignored the doomsday scenario painted by industry bosses and decided to end the current relationship with the EU. Whether Britain will be better out of the EU still has to be seen but if the stratospheric tumble of the sterling over the past 24 hours is anything to go by the prospects do not look good. The Scottish independence debate will reopen as the unity of Great Britain comes into question. The result will undoubtedly unleash a whirlwind of economic and political uncertainty in Britain Europe and possibly even the rest of the world. Malta will also not be spared and the government has done well to pre-emptively identify the sectors and issues at risk as a result of Brexit. But even if the whirlwind will cause damage it will not be the end of the world. Life will go on. However politicians and EU institutions are well-advised to realise that the political and social landscape has changed not only for the UK but also for other countries in Europe where anti-EU sentiment runs high. Politicians would be foolish to ignore the concerns that pushed people to vote Leave. Immigration remains a big challenge for all of Europe. Concerns cannot be summarily brushed aside as racist by the establishment without providing workable solutions. Sweeping the matter under the carpet will only play into the hands of populist politicians who stoke fear and build myths that are not easily dismissed. It is unlikely Brexit will solve the UK’s immigration worries. For starters the UK was not even part of the Schengen area and any future free trade deal with the EU is likely to include free movement of people if it is to be based on the Norwegian model of partnership. But migration concerns are a facet of Europe’s wider malaise. Years of austerity imposed some would argue by Brussels have left many across the continent with a deteriorating quality of life. Millions remain jobless with little or no hope for the future. In a scenario like this it is easy to understand why people will use migration as a scapegoat for their woes. They may not be justified to do so but this is what working class neighbourhoods in the UK did and what others in countries like Italy Denmark and France would likely do if given the chance. The whirlwind will not go away soon but politicians would do well to understand the forces that created it. Brexit could very well serve as Europe’s wake-up call. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Darrin Zammit Lupi  The UK’s decision to exit the EU is having a negative impact on Malta’s individual investor scheme with several local agents reporting a sudden dwindling of interest from potential passport buyers The Sunday Times of Malta is informed. It is a known secret that many of the buyers are not interested in setting up home in Malta but are using the scheme to acquire freedom of movement in the EU. This means the UK’s imminent withdrawal from the bloc is denting the attractiveness of Malta’s scheme. “The UK was a very important selling point for Maltese passport buyers. Most of the Russian and former citizens of the Soviet Union were buying passports to go and live in the UK or send their children there. If this is lost it may be the beginning of the end of the Individual Investment Programme” one agent told The Sunday Times. “Since the UK decision we have received many queries about the scheme. Some applicants have also told us they are no longer interested in proceeding with their application” another agent said. Some applicants have also told us they are no longer interested in proceeding “We think that the government should do something to explain what is going to happen. There is a lot of uncertainty and although buyers are normally millionaires they still don’t like wasting their money.” Since the introduction of the controversial scheme in 2014 to provide rich families with a Maltese passport more than 1000 applications have been received. A passport will set the applicant back €650000 in cash while they also need to invest in a Maltese property or rent for five years. According to law residents have to live in Malta for a year to be eligible for a Maltese passport but rules are said to be lax and easily circumvented. Contacted by this newspaper Henley & Partners the brains behind Malta’s scheme and the government’s concessionaire played down fears that the Brexit will have a negative impact on the IIP. Despite admitting in an interview a few weeks ago that most of Maltese passport buyers had the UK in mind a spokesman said he was sure the UK would retain some kind of relationship with the EU. “I have no doubt that the UK will find some form of association with the EU which will at least for financially independent citizens continue to provide access to settle in the UK” he said. “Brexit will of course not impair visa-free travel between the UK and the EU countries and also have no impact on the visa policy of either the UK or the EU as this has always remained separate with the UK setting its own short-term visa police” the Henley & Partners representative said. Despite all the doom and gloom caused by Brexit some are seeing a silver lining and an opportunity. As the debate in the UK rages on many UK citizens are said to be desperate not to lose their freedom of movement. Politico one of the mostinfluential Brussels-based news portals has suggested UK citizens with “deep pockets” might want to buy a Maltese passport. Describing it as the cheapest option on the market it said that “Maltese passports are a snip at €650000 although wannabe citizens are also required to acquire property on the island and be resident for at least a year.” ivan.camilleri@timesofmalta.com \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The newspaper The Economist described the result of last week’s referendum in the UK on the country’s membership of the European Union as a “self-inflicted blow”. Since the announcement of the result financial markets have been very restless with the pound sterling first losing value and then gaining some of it back. The same occurred with quoted equities across the globe. The present UK government seems to want to take its time to put into effect the (in)famous article 50 which establishes the procedure for a country to exit from the EU. David Cameron the outgoing UK Prime Minister has stated that his successor will make the formal request. Angela Merkel the German Chancellor said that the UK was a very important partner for the rest of the EU in the economic social and political sphere and as such there was no need for undue rush. France has an opposite opinion: French President Francois Hollande has called for a quick exit process. There are even some for whom hope springs eternal who believe that over the coming months the UK will make a U-turn and decide to remain a member of the EU. The European project is a success but we may risk making it fail if some countries insist on closer integration I doubt it. However there is uncertainty among the UK political classes as to how the formal decision to exit the EU is to be taken given that the referendum is not legally binding. It is also quite evident that those who had proposed that the UK leaves the EU have no plan as to how the exit is to take place or the terms of the exit. We even had leading exponents of the Leave campaign reneging on the promises they made making everyone wonder what the British people actually voted for. All this is likely to add to the uncertainty that we have had as a result of the referendum. The more protracted the process is the more chance that economic uncertainty may compound. The downgrade of the UK by the international credit rating agencies does not help in providing clarity. The body language of someone like Boris Johnson betrays this lack of clarity. Having said this I believe that there should be no rush for a UK exit as even the EU itself needs time to ponder. The uncertainty is not caused only by the UK decision or the negotiation process that will lead to Brexit but also by the reactions of other countries and by the collective decision of the remaining 27 member states on the future of the EU. One key element related to the future of the EU is whether to have closer integration or maintain the status quo. Given the high level of euroscepticism in some countries such as France the answer to last week’s referendum in the UK cannot be closer integration. The European project is a success but we may risk making it fail if some countries insist on closer integration. The impact of Brexit needs to be fully assessed by both the UK and the EU before any formal decisions are taken in spite of the fact that a lengthy process may lead to more uncertainty. It may even be argued that if decisions are not rushed what starts to creep in is a conviction that steps are being taken to ensure a win-win situation. So a lengthy process should not necessarily lead to more uncertainty. The long term impact on the EU as a result of Brexit may end up being minimal even if the short term and medium term impact is likely to be very negative. There will need to be a period of adjustment which will also create uncertainty. The impact on Britain is anybody’s guess especially if Scotland presses for independence and London achieves greater autonomy in how to use funds collected from taxation. There is also the impact of Brexit on Malta which needs to be considered. In certain areas Malta will suffer negative consequences. However there will also be opportunities to be exploited. Malta’s traditionally strong ties with the UK can be brought to bear even more in these circumstances. Whichever way one looks at Brexit uncertainty will reign in the coming months and possibly years. Unless steps are taken at EU level to address the daily concerns of the citizens this uncertainty will continue to prevail. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

With Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday asking MPs to give her more time for talks with Brussels to renegotiate her Brexit deal it remains unclear how Britain will leave the European Union. EU officials have ruled out re-opening the withdrawal agreement - the legally binding part of the Brexit deal - but British officials are hopeful that some compromise will be found. Three ultimate scenarios remain - leaving the European Union with a version of the existing deal crashing out with no deal or no Brexit at all. Here are five potential next steps: Try to alter the deal MPs last month roundly rejected the deal negotiated by May in the biggest ever parliamentary defeat for a government. The key sticking point is the agreement\\'s \"backstop\" solution to keep the Irish border open which has the potential to leave Britain indefinitely tied to some form of EU customs union. Brexit hardliners from the Conservative Party\\'s European Research Group have urged May to try and secure legally-binding changes to the backstop. Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party which May relies on for a majority in parliament has also said it will not vote for a deal with the backstop as it stands. The main opposition Labour Party has signalled that it could support the deal if the government commits to a permanent customs union with the EU but May has ruled this out. EU leaders have said they are willing to talk further including on plans for the future trading relationship but have repeatedly said they will not reopen the withdrawal agreement itself. No deal Britain is legally on track to leave the EU with or without a deal on March 29 unless it delays or stops the process. Leaving with no deal in place threatens to trigger a recession in Britain and markedly slow the EU\\'s economic growth as well as causing significant legal disruption. One of the world\\'s biggest economies could lose preferential access to its largest export market overnight affecting every sector leading to rising costs and disruption at British ports. Delay Speculation has been growing that the government will instead seek to postpone the Brexit process. Government ministers have spoken of a technical extension but some reports have suggested the delay could be two or three months or even longer. Political analysts argue lawmakers could still back such a postponement further down the line -- although all the other 27 EU countries would have to agree. A potential complication is that elections to the European Parliament are due in late May and the new chamber is set to sit on July 2. Some of Britain\\'s 73 seats have already been reallocated. Brussels also may not be so keen if the delay would simply translate into more months of political gridlock. Second referendum Dozens of MPs are seeking a new referendum to reverse the 2016 result when the Leave campaign won by 52 percent to 48 percent. But supporters admit they do not currently have the numbers in parliament to make it happen. No law prevents Britain from doing it all over again but many question whether a re-run would be democratic -- or resolve anything. May has warned that another vote \"would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics\". It also threatens to be just as divisive as the last one with opinion polls showing the country is still split over the issue. General election It is a long shot but some reports have suggested the prime minister could call a snap vote in a bid to break the impasse. The most recent polls indicate the Conservatives could win a slender majority meaning that the political rough-and-tumble seen since the 2016 referendum would likely continue. The only other way for an election to be called would be for parliament to vote no confidence in the government but at this stage it looks unlikely as Labour already tried and failed to pass such a vote last month. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May is set to increase spending on Britain\\'s state-run National Health Service (NHS) by £4bn (€4.57 bn) a year funded by borrowing income tax and a \"Brexit dividend\". May said in March that she wanted her government to come up with a long-term plan for health spending in the face of increasing public concern about the state of one of Britain\\'s most beloved institutions. The announcement which would represent a roughly 3 percent annual budget increase is expected to be made on Monday as the publicly-funded NHS nears its 70th anniversary. Britain\\'s healthcare system which delivers free care for all and accounts for a third of government spending on public services is one of the most important issues for voters and is often regarded as a weakness for May\\'s Conservative Party. During the Brexit referendum in 2016 some Leave campaigners including foreign minister Boris Johnson argued £350m a week could be spent on the NHS were Britain to leave the EU. The government is considering freezing the income tax threshold at which people begin paying and the level at which 40 per cent of earnings are paid to fund the budget increase. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 14th 09:05  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

While the British government has had trouble imagining what its exit from the European Union will actually look like the Dutch government unveiled its vision in the form of a hairy beast. Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok tweeted a picture of himself with the creature which is wearing a white t-shirt with the word \"Brexit\" in red letters lying on his desk and stopping him from working. \"Make sure Brexit doesn\\'t get - or lie - in your way\" Blok who has his arms raised in a gesture of mock frustration said in the tweet. \"It\\'s a sort of funny way of warning for Brexit but in a relaxed way\" a Dutch government source told AFP adding that the creature\\'s name was \"Brexit\". The government says the idea is to raise awareness among Dutch businesses of the impact of Brexit especially if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal on March 29. A picture on the government\\'s Brexit awareness website meanwhile appears to show the Brexit muppet as a pest for the \"Me Too\" era sitting on a female office worker\\'s lap and preventing her from reaching her computer. The same picture features in a full-page advertisement in the Financieele Dagblad newspaper. The site - www.brexitloket.nl - has a special tool where firms can check for the potential fallout for their business. Around 1600 people did a \"Brexit scan\" on Thursday since Blok\\'s tweet - more than eight times the average daily number since the site was launched in March 2018 officials said. \\'Waning country\\' The monster campaign also took off on social media including with Dutch Deputy Prime Minister Hugo de Jonge who tweeted to Blok: \"Stef? Give us a little sign of life so we know it ended OK! (Which of our colleagues is in that suit anyway?)\" Stef? Geef even een teken van leven zodat we zeker weten dat het goed is afgelopen![wie van de collega’s zit in dat pak eigenlijk?] pic.twitter.com/Gju7LtlbsY The furry mascot is meanwhile set to feature in other online spots \"literally getting in the way of business\" by blocking trucks and conveyor belts the government has said. Television adverts of the big blue Brexit causing chaos are being filmed but will only be shown on Dutch TV in case there is a no-deal Brexit sources said. The humourous Dutch take on Brexit belies the fact that the Netherlands is taking the issue very seriously. The country has made major preparations to deal with the impact on its economy which is closely linked with Britain. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said in an interview published in the Financial Times on Thursday that around 250 businesses were close to a decision to move to the Netherlands from a \"diminished\" Britain because of Brexit. Rutte also rounded on Britain as a \"waning country compared to two or three years ago\" in a separate interview with Spain\\'s El Pais newspaper. \"It is going to become an economy of intermediate size somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean\" said Rutte. The strong comments came as a surprise as he has long been seen as an ally of Britain and was one of British Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s first ports of call when trying to negotiate a Brexit deal. The Dutch cabinet has meanwhile been granted emergency powers to deal with the impact and has set aside €100 million for preparations including the appointment of 900 new customs officers. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Children will learn about it in history lessons and analysts will include it in their\\xa0models when trying to capture Black Swan events.It was the worst one-day drop in equity prices in history - and what’s worse is that it happened on a Friday. Anything could have happened during the weekend so investors who did not want to take any chances continued dumping stocks on the market.We started off the week with another down day. But markets started to turn on Tuesday as investors started to see some positivity in all of this. In fact ironically as it may seem the FTSE 100 got back all of its losses and is now trading in positive territory.The reasons for this change in sentiment is as follows:Potential for further stimulus by the Bank of EnglandBank of England Governor Mark Carney said the central bank would probably need to pump more stimulus into Britain\\'s economy over the summer after the shock of last week\\'s decision by voters to leave the European Union.Carney also said he would not consider resigning from the Bank if his critics from the referendum\\'s Leave campaign who were angered by his warnings of a Brexit hit to Britain\\'s economy end up filling a power vacuum in the government.ECB could add to stimulus if inflation worsensThe European Central Bank is in no rush to ease its monetary policy in response Britain\\'s vote to leave the European Union taking comfort in a calmer-than-feared market reaction.They stressed the ECB\\'s willingness to provide more stimulus if the inflation outlook worsens but cautioned the UK vote was raising political questions that were for EU governments and institutions rather than the central bank to answer.Not a Lehman scenarioThe UK\\'s Brexit vote has not triggered a \"Lehman moment\" in financial markets despite the sharp sell-off.Vítor Constancio the vice-resident of the ECB denied comparisons between the UK\\'s vote to leave the EU and the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers that triggered the global financial crisis.The reaction to Lehman was that several markets froze with a big impact all over the world. That was not the case this time.The second point is that the negative effect on prices in markets was more extended in the case of Lehman that indeed triggered a major international crisis. So the reactions of markets so far do not justify the comparison.ConclusionThe recovery in markets over the last week was a result of traders taking positions following the biggest one-day crash on record. However there is still a lot of uncertainty in the markets.For those investors tempted to get back in the markets do so with caution because we are in for a bumpy ride.

Lord Ashdown a passionate voice within the ‘Stay’ movement said Brexit would eventually lead to the dismantling of the United Kingdom leaving England on its own. “Our future is not to hide behind a fortress wall shouting insults at foreigners” he said adding that in spite of the predictions of various polls on a sway towards ‘Stay’ he had no confidence about the outcome of the June 23 referendum. “There is a grumpiness in people which has been fed by right-wing foreign owned media which has never been successfully countered by politicians” he said. He also forecast severe internal conflicts within the Labour and Conservative parties should Britain leave the EU as well as fresh impetus to the voices on the mainland who wanted disintegration of the Union. The theme of disintegration also dominated the speech by former Italian prime minister Mario Monti who said however that this would not be the result of separation – such as Grexit or Brexit – but rather of implosion from growing acrimony between people and their governments who they felt were being driven by short term incentives. “Political leaders are becoming political followers driven not even by their need to be re-elected after a few years but only seeing as far as the next public opinion poll…” he lamented. Political leaders are becoming political followers driven not even by their need to be re-elected after a few years but only seeing as far as the next public opinion poll The conference on the theme of Mediterranean leadership started with a session on the common future of Europe North Africa and the Middle East and Syria naturally featured prominently in the speeches. Lord Ashdown and former US assistant secretary of State James Rubin had a heated debate on the role of Russia in Syria with the former adamant that “high explosives” would not be enough to solve the issue and that Russian and even Iran had to be brought into an alliance. \\xa0“After Iraq Afghanistan and Libya haven’t we learned anything? The West is reaching the end of its power to affect the outcomes of conflict. It is foolish to think that Western intervention can work!” he said. Mr Rubin pointed out that there had not been any Western intervention in Syria – and that it was wrong to tie the issues of removing Assad and of tackling ISIS together. Mr Rubin dedicated much of his speech to lambasting the “simplistic” foreign policy of Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump saying it should be obvious that it could not work to assume that deals could be struck through force of will as America’s partners had their own national interests and deals had to be the result of negotiation. The conference was opened by President Marie Louise Coleiro who gave the audience an impassioned plea to “make peace your business”.\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine went viral last week with his remarks that the UK will be suffering the greatest loss of sovereignty in its history with its withdrawal from the European Union. Heseltine touches on the reason which had motivated me Simon Busuttil and thousands of other Maltese in our battle to secure our place in the EU – that membership in the EU is a means of holding our destiny more firmly in our hands by being part of a constructive force for unity and common solutions around the table of members at the European Parliament and at the council. Today more than ever no member state alone no matter how large is capable of offering its citizens solutions on the management of migration flows better paid jobs and better lifestyles unless it works in a larger grouping of states capable of having the upper hand in trade deals and relations with mammoth multinationals. In this context Brexit is tragic. We the Maltese know the UK better than many others. We know that the UK MEPs and the UK ministers in the council have been an important factor for creativity and additional ambition in the European project. Many achievements of the union today from our emphasis on SMEs to more weight to innovation policies and many more areas are marked with the UK’s input. The union today is indeed richer thanks to the UK’s experience and insight be it on security internal market and environmental matters. The UK itself has benefited greatly from EU accession. Entering as the sick man of Europe in the 1970s it is now one of its strongest economies with a strong export-focused services industry benefitting from a 500 million strong EU market. On 23 June all of these achievements were put into question. Prime Minister Theresa May’s interpretation of that referendum vote is radical and unforgiving. Her letter to trigger the withdrawal negotiations is equally misguided. With constant hints of repercussions like making security cooperation conditional to concessions on single market access and with unfeasible demands of opening the post-Brexit trade talks before seeing to other more impending withdrawal matters May has set the scene for a hardening of lines by all actors in the continent. The UK’s withdrawal will not change our common heritage and our shared values This hard reality could not have been clearer in the European Parliament plenary. The Parliament had no other option but to react to May’s hard line with the union’s hard line. The EP resolution makes it clear that there will be no membership benefits without membership responsibilities and that the UK should refrain from any trade talks before the withdrawal negotiations are settled. As a Maltese representative in the European Parliament my intervention in plenary highlighted the need to protect the strong bonds between the union and the UK. The UK’s withdrawal will not change our common heritage and our shared values. We should ensure that our values keep on guiding us into a new relationship based on trust and common interests. This does not mean that the UK can have the cake and eat it. Membership privileges come with membership responsibilities. It is clear therefore that the upcoming negotiations have to draw difficult distinctions between the benefits that the UK can enjoy and the benefits that will have to be reserved to members. Finally assisting at the Brexit debate reminds us of our own road to accession before 2004 when so many Maltese put their energies behind our European dream and against the scaremongering of the Labour Party. It would appear that the Labour Party today recognises its huge mistake of going against the European aspirations of the people of Malta but as we know appearances can be tricky. We just saw the appeal made by the chairman of the Panama Papers inquiry committee Werner Langen to Prime Minister Joseph Muscat to ask Keith Schembri to testify on his involvement in the Panama Papers scandal being met with arrogant replies by government apparatchiks. This is only the last scene in a long series of act and omissions by this government from the sale of European citizenship to the proposal of candidates for members of the court of auditors rejected by the European Parliament to opaque back-room deals with third countries showing the dismissive and careless attitude of this government when it comes to projecting our country’s image within the EU. All of us who appreciate our EU membership and who like me believe that this goes beyond mere commercial interests but relates also to our values as Maltese and Europeans will tell this government to reconsider this tone and bring us back in the fold as protagonists in the European project. The tragedy unfolding in the UK tells us very clearly that union membership benefits are not a stone-clad guarantee. Our union membership benefits from the millions we receive in EU funds to the infinite opportunities for our businesses and our youths depend on our will to stand up for our achievements and to our governments when they put them at risk.

British Prime Minister Theresa May faces a showdown on Tuesday with lawmakers who want power to force her government to go back to the negotiating table if they reject a Brexit deal testing her plans for leaving the European Union. On the first day of votes that could further complicate her tortured negotiations to quit the EU parliament will debate a demand for a \"meaningful vote\" on any agreement May negotiates with Brussels before leaving the bloc next March. Such a vote would give the lower house of parliament more power to set the government\\'s \"direction\" if lawmakers reject the agreement which could mean sending May back into negotiations with EU officials just months before Britain is due to leave. May says her Brexit blueprint or EU withdrawal bill offers lawmakers a meaningful vote on a final deal when they can either accept or reject it which would see Britain crash out. Beyond that her Brexit minister David Davis told BBC radio the government would never allow lawmakers to reverse Brexit. \"Whatever we do we\\'re not going to reverse that\" Davis said. \"A meaningful vote is not the ability to reverse the decision of the referendum.\" Conservative Party officials have been frantically lobbying lawmakers to support the government in a series of votes on amendments handed down from the upper house of parliament on the EU withdrawal bill which will sever ties with the EU by copying and pasting the bloc\\'s laws. May made a last-ditch appeal to lawmakers on Monday and Davis sent a letter making the same case - vote against the prime minister and risk tying Britain\\'s hands in the Brexit negotiations. The government has also tried to stem rebellions by offering its own options - on the meaningful vote it has proposed a 28-day breathing space if parliament rejects a Brexit deal. It is not clear whether that will win over potential rebels but another proposal for an alternative to an amendment on the customs union which refers only to customs arrangements seems to have won over Conservatives to the government line. \"We are asking members of parliament to abide by the referendum result our manifesto commitment and to back our country\" Andrew Bridgen Conservative lawmaker and Brexit campaigner told Reuters. \"It\\'s not difficult.\" TEST The \"meaningful vote\" will be the first major test after the House of Lords introduced 15 changes to the bill trying to reshape the government\\'s approach to Brexit by encouraging the lawmakers to press for the closest possible ties. On Tuesday parliament will also debate other amendments including a challenge to the government\\'s plan to put March 29 2019 or \\'Brexit Day\\' into law and an attempt to toughen a commitment to ensure a frictionless border between Northern Ireland and the neighbouring Irish Republic which will remain in the EU. On Wednesday parliament will consider a challenge to her commitment to leave the EU\\'s single market and customs union which will transform Britain\\'s future trading relationships for many years to come. If May is defeated in the House of Commons it will be yet another blow to a prime minister whose authority has been challenged several times since she lost the Conservative Party\\'s majority in an ill-judged election last year. She now relies on the support of a small Northern Irish party. To try to ensure the government wins ministers and other lawmakers have been told to make sure they will be in parliament for the votes. \"There have been lots of meetings we are keen to engage with all members of the parliamentary party\" May\\'s spokesman said. \"And I imagine that there will be (more).\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 14th 09:05  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The problem with any referendum is that both camps focus on the immediate outcome with supporters thinking in black and white – or in this case ‘stay’ or ‘leave’. It is hard to believe that by the time the next Business Observer is out that the momentous decision will have been taken but it is even harder to anticipate the fall-out.

British finance minister George Osborne said he hoped there would be a \"less divisive\" debate in the remaining days leading up to the UK\\'s EU referendum on Thursday as the campaign to decide Britain\\'s membership of the European Union restarted after a three-day hiatus following the killing of lawmaker Jo Cox. Labour\\'s Cox an ardent supporter of EU membership was shot and stabbed in the street in her electoral district in northern England on Thursday shocking Britain and raising questions about the tone of campaigning. A 52-year-old man appeared in a London magistrate\\'s court on Saturday charged with her murder. \"I hope because of the tragic death of Jo we can have a less divisive political debate in our country and particularly in the last few days of this referendum we can have less baseless assertion and inflammatory rhetoric and more reasoned argument and facts\" Osborne told journalist Robert Peston on ITV television today. Immigration and the economy has defined the debate over Britain\\'s membership of the European Union and following the death of Mrs Cox questions have been raised about the tone of the campaign from both Leave and Remain sides. \"There are perfectly legitimate concerns about migration concerns that are felt in every Western democracy in the world. \"But I think there is a difference between addressing those concerns in a reasonable way and whipping up concerns whipping up division making baseless assertions that millions of people are going to come into the country in the next couple of years from Turkey or saying that dead bodies are going to wash up on the beaches of Kent or indeed putting up that disgusting and vile poster that Nigel Farage did which had echoes of literature used in the 1930s\" Osborne said. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the hit to the country\\'s economy from a vote to leave the EU could be more severe than the most likely scenario forecast by the government. The finance ministry estimated in May that a vote to leave the EU would mean the economy would be 6 percent smaller within two years than if Britain voted to stay in inflation would rise more sharply and house prices would be 18 percent lower. The leader of Britain\\'s UK Independence Party (UKIP) Nigel Farage who strongly favors a Brexit told Peston that he had been a \"victim\" of hatred when asked by Peston how he responded to claims that he stoked up hatred in the EU referendum campaign. \"When you challenge the establishment in this country they come after you they call you all sorts of things. And to be honest we saw the Chancellor a few minutes ago despite the fact overnight he talked about toning down the rhetoric doing the same thing again. \"All we have said in this referendum campaign is we want to take back control of our lives take back control of our borders and put in place a responsible immigration policy.\" \"Quite frankly when it comes to negativity and rhetoric we\\'ve seen far more of it from the Remain side\" he added. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo:\\u2008Rob Wilson/Shutterstock.com  On June 23 2016 the British people voted to leave the European Union in an exemplary manifestation of the democratic process. This did not surprise me. What I did find surprising was the outpouring of scorn coming from Malta against this perfectly legitimate exercise of a democratic right. It seems that many of us think that the British should be punished and made to pay for their audacity in daring to leave the EU. In fact we should now cast them out in Biblical style and may they and their progeny be damned. We appear to have forgotten the cultural and historical bonds that Malta shares with United Kingdom and how we stood shoulder to shoulder in less fortunate times not so long ago. This article is not intended to pretentiously give an opinion as to what is the best course of action for the UK but to point out that the British people might actually know what they are doing and we at least owe them respect and the benefit of the doubt. In any case time will tell. Much has been said about how the British are going to regret the decision to leave the EU and about the economic doom that will befall the UK as a result. Interestingly one does not read anywhere about what the UK’s future would have been if it remained in the EU. Surely it is logical that an option should be compared to its alternative. Would it actually have been better for the UK to continue with more of the same or was it time for a change? To say that the majority of UK voters are racists and that the single motivation for the Brexit vote was to send all immigrants back home is ill-informed. It is typical of EU rhetoric that when democratic outcomes do not comply with the European elite’s agenda these are the result of popu\\xadlism or the ranting of the far right. However when the outcomes reinforce the EU agenda it is then a victory for democracy. This is patronising in the extreme. In my opinion the British people voted in their majority to leave the EU in order to reclaim the independence of their judiciary; in order to give back sovereignty to their parliament; in order to get back control over their economy; in order to control their borders; in order to regain competitiveness and the ability to negotiate their own trade deals; in order for their foreign policy to reflect their values and their needs; in order to regain control over their territorial waters and because in the final analysis this was in the best interest of their country. These are all legitimate and sensible reasons. The UK is the world’s fifth largest economy. Prior to the referendum it was being forecast that following a decision to leave the EU the UK would go into recession. The opposite in fact is taking place. National output increased by 0.7 per cent in the last three months of 2016 and the forecast increase in national output is 1.8 per cent for 2016 and two per cent for 2017. US investment bank JPMorgan has endorsed the UK’s national output forecast growth estimate at 1.9 per cent for 2017. Prosperity depends on competent governance not on being part of a trading bloc. The UK has concluded that the only entity that it makes sense to belong to is the world Unemployment in the UK has fallen to 4.7 per cent in January 2017 the lowest level in more than 40 years. British business has taken up the challenge and is well set to make a success of it. The company tax rate is to be reduced from 20 per cent to 17 per cent in 2020. It has also been said that the company tax rate may be reduced further to lower than 15 per cent. The UK has a history of reducing company tax which in 2008 was 30 per cent. No reducing taxes does not mean the country is a tax haven it just means that the govern\\xadment has come to its senses. Not having preferential access to the EU single market is inconvenient but that’s about it. Every country in the world has access to the EU single market. It is merely that companies from non-EU members have to pay the import duties (the common external tariff) if they wish to sell inside the union. The UK has its own currency and can therefore use its monetary policy to its own advantage. Any central banker will tell you that a monetary policy tailored to a single country’s economic need is a huge asset.  The City’s concern is that the financial services companies would not be able to passport their services into the EU. Well the City is also concerned that continued EU membership and the over-regulation that that implies would negatively affect London’s status as a leading world financial centre. The whole dilemma will more or less be resolved by UK financial services businesses setting up a branch or subsidiary in an EU Member State while still keeping their headquarters in London. It’s never that simple but it is also not the end of the world for the City. The positive economic data coming out of the UK bodes well however there are no guarantees and the future in or out of the EU is in any case uncertain. It is however absurd to use uncertainty as a criticism of Brexit. It is childish to think that somehow life owes us certainty. The EU is a fundamentally undemocratic organisation as it must be when it is centrally controlled and it governs over 28 geographically and culturally distinct electorates. This is not so much a criticism as a statement of fact. Moreover there is some confusion in EU circles where bureaucracy is mistaken for democracy. The EU’s foreign policy is a shambles. How is it possible for the UK to have the same foreign policy as Malta or for Latvia to have the same foreign policy as Portugal? A foreign policy should be directly related to the needs of a country’s economy and to the country’s values and culture for it to be of any use. Your neighbours are not necessarily your best allies – history amply illustrates this point. The UK has concluded that the only entity that it makes sense to belong to is the world. This is recognition that a country may have more in common with other more geographically distant nations than it does with its neighbours. The UK will be developing and enhancing its already naturally existing bonds with the Commonwealth countries and the major world markets. China is implementing a similar project with the new Silk Road and Belt initiative. As far as security is concerned the UK is part of NATO and is certainly still a military power to be reckoned with. When it comes to security it is the EU that needs the UK and not the other way around. In my opinion the UK and the EU should aim for a ‘win-win’ outcome to the Brexit negotiations because collaboration yields better results than confrontation and be\\xadcause it makes economic sense for both sides. The EU should also support a democratic decision taken by the British people because the EU should champion democracy. Importantly the EU should not be a prison and a member country should be able to leave without suffering punitive measures and vindictive hostility. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Prime Minister Theresa May refused to budge from her position on Brexit on Wednesday brushing aside criticism from all corners of parliament and saying her strategy was already being negotiated with the European Union. After narrowly escaping defeat in parliament over her plans for leaving the EU May signalled she would not drop a proposal on Britain\\'s future relationship with bloc - the biggest shift in its foreign and trade policy for almost half a century. But by sticking to her plan for a \"business-friendly\" departure that would keep Britain in a free trade zone with the EU for manufactured and agricultural goods May has thrown down the gauntlet both to backers of a cleaner break with the bloc and to those who don\\'t want to leave at all. Since the plan was unveiled earlier this month Brexit supporters and pro-EU lawmakers in her party have been at war with each other and in some cases with the prime minister herself. WATCH: Boris Johnson makes parliamentary plea to \\'save Brexit\\' Brexit supporters complain that the plan means swathes of the British economy would still be subject to rules set in Brussels. Pro-EU politicians complain that it would still leave Britain facing complicated customs procedures and outside the free market for services that make up most of its economy. At a session of parliament May stood firm after being challenged by one pro-Brexit lawmaker in her party to explain when she had decided to change her catchphrase from \"Brexit means Brexit\" to \"Brexit means Remain\". \"Brexit continues to mean Brexit\" May said to cheers from her Conservative supporters. At a later meeting of her lawmakers senior party officials said May was welcomed. One government minister said on condition of anonymity that the Conservatives had come to their senses and were backing her Brexit plan. But that did not stop Boris Johnson the former foreign minister who quit last week over May\\'s plan from renewing his call for government to rethink it saying \"it is not too late to save Brexit\". May said talks had already started with Brussels based on the proposal which was set down in a policy document last week and referred to as \"Chequers\" for the prime minister\\'s country residence where its terms were thrashed out. The prime minister insisted she was confident Britain had enough time to negotiate a deal with the EU before leaving in March next year and denied suggestions that Britain was moving closer to a \"no-deal\" Brexit. May would face a leadership challenge if 15 percent of the members of parliament from her Conservative Party wrote letters calling for one. But many of them fear that would bring down the government and force an election which could be won by the opposition Labour Party and its left-wing leader Jeremy Corbyn. In a sign of Conservative lawmakers falling into line one of them Simon Clarke told the party meeting that he had submitted such a letter but was now withdrawing it for the sake of party unity. \"We\\'ve looked into the abyss in the last few days\" he told reporters outside the meeting. \"Chequers would not be my preferred option ... but I\\'m also clear that Conservative Party civil war is not where we need to be at this time - the threat of a Corbyn government or no Brexit at all has to be borne in mind.\" May\\'s vulnerability in parliament where she lost her majority in an ill-judged election last year was laid bare on Monday and Tuesday when she faced rebellions from both the pro-Brexit and pro-EU wings of her party. She won the votes on a customs and a trade bill but suffered an unexpected defeat on a separate amendment which means her government must now seek continued participation in the European medicines regulatory framework. One Conservative lawmaker told Reuters the party whips whose job it is to enforce discipline in parliament had threatened to call a confidence vote in May if she lost -- a move that could bring down the government. Johnson figurehead of the Brexit campaign in the 2016 referendum urged May to change her Brexit strategy in a scathing assessment of the government\\'s handling of the negotiations. \"We have time in these negotiations we have changed tack once and we can change again\" he said in his resignation speech to parliament on Wednesday more than a week after he quit. \"It is as though a fog of self-doubt has descended\" Johnson said. \"We should not and need not be stampeded by anyone.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Brexit minister David Davis warned on Thursday that parliament could veto any final deal negotiated with the European Union unless it has a \"substantive\" idea of what the future trading relationship will look like. Britain is aiming to secure a comprehensive free trade deal with the European Union and wants it to be signed shortly after it leaves the bloc in March 2019 although there is scepticism about how much can be agreed by then. Britain\\'s parliament will vote on a formal withdrawal treaty later in the year — covering issues such as the divorce bill and citizens\\' rights - in a potential flashpoint in the Brexit process. Davis said Members of Parliament would insist on \"a lot of detail\" before signing off on any deal because Britain will have to make a payment of about £39 billion to the EU to honour its financial obligations to the trade bloc. \"The withdrawal agreement is payments of up to £39 billion it\\'s a lot of money and parliament is unlikely to sign off on it unless we can be pretty substantive about what is going to be there in the long run\" Davis said at a Wall Street Journal event in London. Opponents of leaving the EU have identified winning enough support in the lower house of parliament the House of Commons to block any possible deal the government brings back from Brussels as their best chance of overturning Brexit. Britain\\'s vast financial services industry would emerge largely unscathed from Brexit and the sector would suffer far fewer job losses than first feared Davis said. \"There is not going to be a mass migration the critical mass is still going to be here\" he said. \"The reason that the City is the biggest and most successful financial centre in the world ... is not just Europe it\\'s about the mass of skills the business environment here it\\'s about the reliability of tax law.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

At first I thought it was a tongue in the cheek joke but on reflection I realised he really does believe the rubbish pumped out by the mainstream media\\xa0English newspapers. He quotes manufacturing as being at a 30-year high.\\xa0 What has obviously passed him by is the fact that the UK is no longer a world rated power in manufacturing. Brexiteers love to talk about how we will be a manufacturing powerhouse when the facts quoted by heads of businesses clearly state that these jobs are gone never to return. We do produce lots of things designed to kill people and sell them to whoever can afford to buy them but that trade is not one that fills me with pride. Mr Deeley quotes a 2.8 per cent pay rise in three months but carefully omits to quote the record length of\\xa0recent pay freezes which put a great many families on the breadline and led to the proliferation of food banks. His quote of record employment is another meaningless statistic as it omits people over 50 who are unemployed and very likely to so remain. As for the pound being a strong currency tell that to anyone changing sterling to euros. To state that sterling is the strongest performer in the G10 nations smacks of Alice in Wonderland. The hard facts are that we are being led by an incompetent bunch of low performers in government who are up against a much more intelligent group of negotiators at the EU table and their performance is an embarrassment to watch as they blunder from one catastrophe to another. Already big businesses are setting up main offices in the EU to make sure that their operations will not be compromised by a disadvantageous Brexit deal. We in Scotland voted strongly in favour of remaining in the EU and if we were to be independent of the UK I would be only too happy to see an English Brexit while we remained in the EU.

As Britain\\'s March 29 departure from the European Union looms several major groups have announced they are downsizing their operations or completely shipping out. Here is a snapshot of what\\'s happening: Industry hit hard Japanese car maker Honda announced Tuesday it will close in 2021 its plant in the southwestern English town of Swindon putting 3500 jobs at risk. Honda said Brexit was not a factor but the announcement comes after its competitor Nissan decided in February to ditch plans to build its X-Trail SUV at its plant in northeastern England due to Britain\\'s departure. The new line would have created about 740 jobs. Jaguar Land Rover said in January it would axe around 4500 mostly UK jobs one-tenth of its global workforce. It put the move down to a slump in Chinese sales buyers dumping diesel cars for electric as well as uncertainties linked to Brexit. Also in January Dutch multinational Philips announced the closure in 2020 of a factory in eastern England making baby bottles threatening 430 jobs. It cited \"ongoing geopolitical challenges\" months after warning about Brexit and said it would transfer work back to its Dutch base. Schaeffler a German maker of parts for cars and industrial products is also planning to shut two UK sites with Brexit cited for axing up to a reported 500 jobs. Banks reorganise Major financial players based in Britain are also worried: should the UK leave the European single market banks based there will lose the \"passports\" that allow them to do business from London with clients across the remaining 27 members of the bloc. To continue operating in Europe many financial firms will have to set up new business units in EU countries and some are already boosting their operations mainly in Paris and Frankfurt. Bank of America and HSBC are among those that plan to reduce their activities in London in favour of Paris while US firms Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley and Citigroup will do likewise in Frankfurt. Japan\\'s Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Daiwa Securities and Nomura and Britain\\'s Standard Chartered have also chosen Frankfurt. Headquarters moving out The European Union\\'s various agencies are not allowed to be based outside the union. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) - one of the world\\'s most powerful drugs watchdogs and which employs 900 pharmaceutical experts biologists and doctors - has chosen to relocate to Amsterdam. Based in 1995 in London\\'s Canary Wharf business district it is in a court battle to break its lease which runs until 2039. The European Banking Authority and its nearly 200 staff will leave London for Paris. The monitoring base for the bloc\\'s Galileo satnav system will quit Swanwick in southern England for Madrid and anti-piracy forces will move their headquarters to Spain and France. Several major multinationals have also chosen to shift their headquarters from Britain amid the Brexit uncertainties. The Japanese electronics giant Sony announced it will transfer its European headquarters from Britain to The Netherlands by the end of March to avoid Brexit-related customs issues. British electric appliance pioneer Dyson will switch headquarters to Singapore this year saying though that this was due to booming Asian demand and not because of Brexit. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 14th 09:05  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Leaders of 22 European higher education bodies including University of Malta rector Alfred Vella have called for the speeding up of Brexit negotiations so that talks can begin over the future of European research collaboration and student mobility. In a signed statement the representative organisations of universities and national rectors’ conferences from across Europe asked for clarification on arrangements for the Horizon 2020 European research and innovation programme and the Erasmusplus exchange programme after March 2019 when the UK is due to leave the EU. On October 20 the European Council Summit concluded that not enough progress had been made to start the second phase of Brexit negotiations when research and higher education are expected to start. Prof. Janet Beer president of Universities UK and vice-chancellor of Liverpool University said the lack of clarity is causing problems for universities: “We are now entering the period in which universities need to be finalising their research collaboration and student exchange programmes for 2019. There is an urgent need for clarity on the UK’s participation in Horizon 2020 beyond Brexit. This scheme enhances the impact of our research by providing access to vital networks talent and funding. Without clarity the risk is that important European research programmes could stall. “The arrival on campuses across Europe of students hoping to study abroad in 2019 increases the need to know whether the UK will or will not be able to continue to take part in Erasmusplus. Participation in outward mobility schemes has major benefits for students universities and employers.”\\u200b \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 14th 09:05  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

It is true business has been patient with Theresa May regarding Brexit but that is only because it had little option when it did not know the British government’s strategy. Now that a fragile common negotiating position has been unveiled the confusion continues. The government’s strategy towards the services sector including financial services appears to be on business having less access to the EU market. This will have an impact both on the UK and on EU countries with significant financial services ties to London such as Ireland Luxembourg and Malta. Moreover as you rightly point out the UK government is gambling on an à la carte approach and in so doing defying the so-called red lines of the European Commission. Michel Barnier has said repeatedly the commission will not countenance a pick and mix approach to Single Market access.\\xa0 Together Britain and the wider business community faces the consequences of May’s ill-considered gamble. As George Bernard Shaw once remarked “in gambling the many must lose in order that the few may win”.

The overwhelming view from economists is that it is too early to know how Britain will cope with years of Brexit uncertainty - but there is a growing belief the country can avoid a recession that only weeks ago was regarded as likely. On the face of it the early optimism contrasts with the pre-referendum warning from former Prime Minister David Cameron that a Brexit vote would put a \"bomb under the economy\". Retail sales in August reversed much of an immediate post-Brexit vote fall with retailers reporting their strongest sales in six months industry data showed on Thursday partly due to a weaker pound attracting overseas buyers. Official figures out last week showed the number of people claiming unemployment benefit fell unexpectedly in July. Before the June 23 referendum the British finance ministry had warned a Brexit vote would mean homeowners facing higher borrowing costs pushing the economy into a \"DIY recession\" and that equity prices were likely to fall. However nearly half of mortgage borrowers look set to gain from the Bank of England\\'s interest rate cut on Aug. 4 while British equity markets have risen. Some British newspapers which supported the Leave campaign have hailed such news. \"Remainers were WRONG!\" the Daily Express declared earlier this month adding: \"Brexit Britain booms\". But most economists do not share this jubilance and caution these positive signals may have little bearing on the long-term outlook for the economy which must contend with years of uncertainty as Britain extricates itself from the EU. \\'WE DON\\'T KNOW\\' New British Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will not trigger the EU\\'s Article 50 this year to begin formal talks with the bloc to negotiate the terms of Britain\\'s exit from the EU and its future trading relationship with the bloc. \"The fact that the UK avoided an immediate crisis does not tell us much about the future\" said Holger Schmieding chief economist at Berenberg Bank adding he thought Britain would probably avoid a technical recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of falling economic output. Business surveys and some forward-looking indicators of inflation already offer reasons for caution. Retail outlets haven\\'t felt the pinch. Photo: Shutterstock Price pressures in factories - which feed through into consumer prices - shot higher after the pound\\'s post-referendum plunge posing a threat to consumers\\' future spending power. Market research firm GfK\\'s gauge of consumer confidence also fell sharply after the vote. The survey often predicts changes in household spending in the following quarters. The outlook for the housing market the bedrock of British consumer wealth is also unclear: a Reuters poll on Thursday suggested the Brexit vote will have a negative impact on both prices and turnover. [GB/HOMES] Charles Goodhart a former BoE interest-rate setter said so far there had been almost no data on important areas of the economy such as investment inventory levels and construction. \"I think it would be very dangerous to take a position either that it\\'s all going to be alright and that the fears were massively overdone or that the fears were justified\" said Goodhart a professor at the London School of Economics said. \"The answer is frankly: we don\\'t know.\" FTSE RISES While the mood among economists remains one of concern it has brightened across financial markets. Investors were braced for a global economic shock after a vote for Brexit but the FTSE 100 index of UK blue-chip companies is about 8 percent higher since the referendum helped by overseas earnings that will benefit from the fall in the value of the pound. The more domestically focused FTSE 250 index of mid-sized companies is up by about 5 per cent. Many big companies have reported little immediate impact from the vote in Britain including retailers John Lewis and Next the world\\'s biggest staffing company Adecco and carmaker BMW. Some major employers - carmaker Nissan for example - say their plans for investment in Britain will hinge on the trade deals it strikes with other countries. Martin Sorrell chief executive of the world\\'s largest advertising group WPP said there was little clarity on when Britain would even begin negotiating its EU exit and that his company\\'s clients were increasingly cautious. \"Our own position will depend on what gets negotiated\" he told Reuters. The pound\\'s fall since the referendum - it was down almost 15 per cent at one point versus the dollar - has benefited some companies; it has boosted manufacturers\\' exports for example. But it also reflects the weaker outlook for the economy. \"In essence the currency markets are saying that all UK assets are worth less than they used to be\" Rupert Pennant-Lea a former BoE deputy governor wrote in the Financial Times. \"The British have become poorer than they were before the votes were counted on June 23 and that reality will become clearer as the months go by.\" But investors responding to the recent upbeat data have cut their bets against a weaker pound this week which has helped lift the currency. Sterling has started to edge higher against major currencies but it remains around 11 percent lower against the dollar than before the referendum underscoring how investors see the challenge ahead for Britain\\'s economy. BEYOND BRITAIN Many international investors had feared a Brexit vote would undermine the EU and hurt business and market confidence across the euro zone. But surveys point to little impact so far. As a result many banks are revising forecasts for further European Central Bank stimulus. JPMorgan says it no longer expects the ECB to cut rates or announce an extension of its bond-buying programme in September after solid growth data. The Federal Reserve had warned extensively of the risk of financial reverberations from a Brexit vote which was one of the factors that led to it holding off from raising rates this year. But the US economy has barely flinched since the vote. For now economists are playing the long game. Official data due next month will offer a better gauge of Britain\\'s resilience to Brexit providing the first detailed breakdown of how manufacturing services and construction firms fared in July. \"Any short-term growth slowdown matters but the economics of Brexit are mostly about the long term\" said Robert Wood an economist with BofA Merrill Lynch. \"Leaving the EU single market is in our view likely to make the UK less open to trade and therefore damage economic performance in the long run.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Those following the UK debate on the likely effects of the UK’s exit from the EU must feel more confused as the referendum campaign draws to an end than they did at the beginning. Claims and counterclaims range from political scaremongering to possibly quite realistic forecasts. What is of interest for Malta is a clinical analysis leading to predictions on how the different sectors of the economy are likely to be affected if Britain were to leave the EU. The rating agency Fitch is one of many organisations that have come up with such an analysis even if at a first glance their findings look rather superficial. Fitch concludes that Malta together with Belgium the Netherlands Cyprus and Luxembourg whose exports of goods and services to the UK amount to a minimum eight per cent of GDP are the most exposed to negative effects as a result of Brexit. This sounds like a reasonable assessment but does it stand the test of scrutiny? Tourism is Malta’s leading service industry and the UK market is still one of the most important. It is very unlikely that British tourists will be put off coming to this island only because the UK unlike Malta will no longer be a member of the EU. It is more likely that if other EU member states place some restrictions on travellers from the UK it will be Malta that will benefit because of our traditional ties with Britain. The financial services industry is another important economic activity for Malta. This industry is almost by definition borderless even if it is becoming more regulated on an international level. Some local financial services operators argue that should the UK decide to leave the EU some boutique financial services operators like fund managers based in London but with close business links to the EU may decide to relocate to an EU jurisdiction like Malta or Luxembourg. So it is more likely that the financial services sector in Malta would benefit as a result of Brexit. Manufacturing output in Malta is no longer what it used to be as the local economy becomes increasingly services oriented. While exports to the UK are still important Maltese exporters are now more focused on selling their goods in other EU countries as well as the Middle East. The effects of Brexit on the manufacturing sector are therefore unlikely to be of any major significance. What is possibly more significant is the likely political fallout from Brexit. If the UK decides to vote against remaining in the EU next June it will be the first country to do so. Some political analysts argue that this could well be the beginning of a steady erosion of the EU influence on global politics. With Europe facing major security and immigration crises the lack of strong political leadership from Brussels may continue to foment increasing euroscepticism among ordinary people. The EU without Britain will be a weaker political union and that will not be good for Malta. Fitch is right when it forecasts that “Brexit would create a precedent for countries leaving the EU” especially in the present context of political fragmentation in most EU countries. This fragmentation is inhibiting political leaders from taking tough decisions to strengthen the economic infrastructure of the EU. Fitch forecasts on the likely economic effects of Brexit on Malta are possibly just educated guesses though the predicted political effects on the EU as a whole are more convincing. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Catherine Benson/Reuters  The sterling sank against the dollar yesterday as the defection of London mayor Boris Johnson to the ‘Brexit’ camp added to concerns that a British departure from the EU is a real risk. After a positive reaction to Prime Minister David Cameron’s sealing of an EU deal on Friday with which to fight a referendum on June 23 the move by Johnson along with a handful of other senior ruling Conservatives drove a wave of selling in Asia. The pound hit a three-week low against the dollar of $1.4175 as European markets came on line down 1.5 per cent down on the day. If maintained that would mark its biggest one-day fall in 11 months. The sterling also fell sharply against the euro losing around one per cent to 78.08 pence per euro. Bets on sterling weakness over the next six months reached their highest in more than four years. “The out camp were struggling to get a figurehead who was popular and Boris has given them that boost” said Alvin Tan a strategist with French bank Société Générale in London. “I think there is genuine worry that Britain might vote to leave and the uncertainty is going to rise into the referendum. Apart from the fall in cable the implied volatility in sterling has moved up sharply.” The pound also dipped below 160 yen for the first time in more than two years. The euro was broadly weaker down almost half a percent against the dollar but the mood on a number of the currency markets battered most by concerns over global growth was steadier. The dollar firmed to 112.86 yen 0.2 per cent above its levels at the end of last week and off Friday’s one-week low of 112.30. The Australian and New Zealand dollar were both around half a per cent higher. Traders said investor appetite for risk was supported by expectations that G20 finance ministers and central bank governors may address routs in financial markets this year when they gather in Shanghai later this week. Several bank economists have speculated that this may include new commitments to support growth with public spending although most may down the chances of a grand bargain like the 1980s Plaza Accord. “Ultimately we anticipate the meetings will provide modest support to asset markets” Citi analysts said in a morning note. “A continued build-up of expectations for a coordinated response to slow economic growth and recent market volatility could support risk appetite.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A vote to leave the EU in the UK referendum is likely to result in reducing the size of the country’s financial services industry the world’s biggest fund manager BlackRock said yesterday. The country currently has a surplus in financial insurance and pension services of £18.5 billion but post-exit regulatory challenges could see that eroded said BlackRock which manages £3.3 trillion in assets. Much of the surplus with the EU is based on participants’ access to the single market in financial services through a ‘passport’ access to which could be curtailed it said in a wide-ranging report. Among the main risks would be that of the EU making it harder for countries outside the region to access such a single market Among the regulatory hurdles would be what to do with 40 years’ worth of EU regulations that had not been formally enshrined in UK law and which the government would need to replicate. And even if future laws were replicated it did not mean access to the single market would be given to UK-based firms BlackRock added citing the potential for access to be blocked regardless – especially if the EU sought to penalise Britain to prevent other countries following suit. “One way to do this would be to refuse to issue the industry a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) passport in our view” BlackRock said which was “crucial” for those looking to sell or advise on investment in funds within the EU. Under that scenario EU investors accessing global markets through Britain would have to take their business elsewhere it said citing Dublin Paris and Frankfurt as European beneficiaries as well as centres in the US and Asia. However if Britain were to remain in the Mifid regulatory framework BlackRock said ‘Brexit’ would be “business as usual” for many as the UK would mirror any EU legislation albeit without having any say in the rule-making process. For funds based in the European Economic Area but managed from the UK the UK would likely be considered an equivalent jurisdiction for day-to-day portfolio management similar to the US it said. Further out an exit would also probably result in the EU’s Capital Markets Union project taking on traits that go against the interests of Britain. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 14th 09:05  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

I refer to the letter entitled ‘Brexit – every threat is an opportunity’ (April 23). While the European Union is imperfect reforming the bloc can be done by people of intelligence and sensitivity who respect the differences in our cultures but also the deeply held values we have in common. As for the financial crisis this was largely a result of poor national leadership and professionals of dubious integrity in each of the EU countries affected. Lessons have been learned.\\xa0Part of the problem is that feckless governments get into various kinds of difficulties and then blame Brussels for all their own failings. Often this is entirely unjustified. This is partly why EU citizens are somewhat disillusioned with the EU. As for the spread of prosperity to the poorer members the new countries will benefit eventually by many of their youth gaining experience abroad and returning with their knowledge and connections to their home countries.\\xa0 On the other hand do you remember the term ‘brain drain’? Already Germans French and others who have built flourishing startups in Britain have already relocated to Berlin and Paris taking with them their highly qualified British workforce who it has been reported are delighted to relocate and remain within Europe. A large proportion of EU nurses and doctors (some of whom\\xa0I know personally) will drift away from the NHS and British health professionals will start to consider Canada Australia and other countries where the conditions are better. And by the way did people anticipate the likely break-up of the United Kingdom when they voted for Brexit let alone the prospect of the return of tensions in Northern Ireland?\\xa0This is a monumental tragedy for all Britons. As for the immigration situation the EU members should take a look at the way Canada deals with immigrants.\\xa0It does not accept all but those it does accept are sponsored at the local level by parishes and other organisations spread throughout the country and in small numbers so ghettos are not formed over time and people are integrated grateful and willing to accept the values of their new country. As for the result of the Brexit vote this was won by the closest of margins 51.9 per cent for Leave compared to 48.1 per cent for Remain. Surely a decision to leave the EU which is a momentous choice should require the approval of at least two-thirds of the electorate? And remember one Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered for her Remain views in an incident as violent and horrific as any terrorist attack by a British maniac.\\xa0Very little was made of this terrible tragedy which happened just one week before the referendum. As for smiles handshakes genuine sympathy and kindness I have received far more of this from Europeans friends and others in the three countries I visit frequently than from Brexiteers who have been less than gracious to us ‘others’ who happen to hold a different opinion.\\xa0My heart is certainly in southern Europe.\\xa0These people have earned by their warmth and indulgence the strong attachment that many of us feel and which sadly we do not see now forthcoming from many of our countrymen. Legally speaking I wonder whether we British residents of Malta and other EU countries could retain the right to some kind of EU citizenship. To strip us against our will of a presently existing entitlement may turn out to\\xa0be legally impossible.

This means UK tourists would need to pay more for the euros they need. Photo: Darrin Zammit Lupi  In 24 days’ time the British will decide whether to end their 43-year relationship with the European Economic Community as the EU was known back when the UK joined in 1973. Malta Ireland Belgium The Netherlands Cyprus and Luxembourg have been named as the countries that would be the most badly hit by a so-called Brexit. Analysts point to a potential recession in the UK consequent depreciation of the sterling a decline in UK consumers’ purchasing power and in the value of investments in the UK. They see Malta as being exposed to these shocks due to its dependence on tourism and investment in the UK by financial institutions operating in Malta. Economist Gordon Cordina believes a Brexit should be avoided but if it did materialise he does not expect major impacts on the Maltese economy. This is for the same reasons that the 2008 financial crisis failed to impact the Maltese economy directly through its financial sector. When it comes to tourism a drop in purchasing power of sterling could affect demand but it could also entail a shift away from longer haul destinations to ones which are cheaper and more accessible. Malta could actually benefit from such trends. How might the exchange rate affect the all-important British tourism to Malta? For another economist Philip von Brockdorff in the unlikely event the ‘leave’ vote wins it would not be the end of the world for the UK. It would adapt and seek separate trade agreements with the EU China the US and emerging economies he said adding that he was more concerned about the implications for the EU and its future as an economic and political bloc. How might the exchange rate affect the all-important British tourism to Malta? The value of the British pound relative to the euro depends on several factors including foreign direct investment in the UK. It is difficult to predict whether sterling would fall although one would expect a period of uncertainty depending on the timeframe for free-trade negotiations with the EU Dr von Brockdorff said. Assuming there is less investment in the period leading to an agreement a lower demand for sterling would weaken its value relative to the euro.\\xa0This means UK tourists travelling to Malta would\\xa0need to pay more for\\xa0the euros they need. Expressing doubts on whether this would last long Dr von Brockdorff noted that one could not ignore the challenges facing the euro area as it struggles to emerge from the post-2008 financial crisis.\\xa0Besides the pound could become a safe haven like the Swiss franc and gain whenever the\\xa0euro area\\xa0was doubtful.  Would duty be charged for online purchases? And would it become more expensive to import cars from the UK? This would depend on trade negotiations with the UK. Dr von Brockdorff believes common sense would prevail and free trade between the UK and EU would remain as in the case of Switzerland which has a free trade agreement with the EU. In the interim exports from the UK may face restrictions but these are likely to be temporary. Since the EU sells\\xa0to the UK\\xa0far more than what it buys from the UK it would not be in\\xa0the EU’s\\xa0interests to impose tariffs even if it could as\\xa0the UK could impose similar tariffs on the goods\\xa0the EU\\xa0sells to the UK he said. Meanwhile James Zammit of Zammit holdings who has just returned from a UK conference for car dealers called CDX16 noted that the feeling among people involved in the car industry was that Brexit will not happen. Will Malta’s VAT exemptions on food and medicine hang in the balance? A Brexit would not mean that Malta would automatically lose the zero rate VAT on foodstuffs and medicinal products which it had negotiated and won prior to joining the EU former European Commissioner Joe Borg says. The concession had been granted to the UK in the 1990s. It was made clear to Malta that it could only retain the concession as long as the UK and Ireland enjoyed it. The EU could however decide to revisit VAT exemptions for all countries as other member states have their own tailor-made concessions. Naturally it would be of comfort to negotiate the exemption with another member state by our side (in this case the UK) but even in the case of a Brexit Malta could still argue that this VAT exemption is essential. Could medical care agreements between Malta and the UK be affected? It is unlikely that a Brexit would affect the patient-exchange agreement in place for 30 years according to Martin Balzan general secretary of the Medical Association of Malta.The agreement might have to be renegotiated however he added. Still a Brexit could affect the freedom of movement of people making it harder for those seeking medical training in the UK. Dr Balzan explained that Malta’s qualifications and system are similar to those of the UK. However before Malta’s accession it was much more difficult for medical professionals to find a job there because of migration bureaucracy which could be reintroduced with a Brexit. Meanwhile the University of Malta would be able to charge tuition fees to UK nationals while to date a significant number enrol without payment. What about those receiving a British pension? While pension rights should remain unchanged the exchange value of the currency could change. Dr von Brockdorff noted that a weak British pound would increase the cost of living for those heavily reliant on a UK pension or income. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 14th 09:05  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The pound tumbled yesterday after the United Kingdom government’s top legal adviser cast doubt on Prime Minister Theresa May’s last-gasp changes to her Brexit deal hours before a vital vote later in the evening. Sterling which had been rising after Ms May secured revisions to the Brexit withdrawal agreement hit reverse after legal advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox. “It looks like any hopes of an unlikely victory for the PM’s deal later have just been extinguished” said XTB analyst David Cheetham. Dr Cox said last-minute new agreements “reduce the risk” of Britain being “indefinitely and involuntarily” held in the so-called Irish border backstop. However he also warned that “the legal risk remains un-changed” that Britain would have no legal means of ending the controversial backstop without the EU’s agreement. In reaction the pound slid to as low as $1.3005 from $1.3143 just before Dr Cox published his advice. The euro jumped to 86.55 pence from 85.75 pence.\\xa0 Overnight following news of May’s hard-won EU concessions sterling had struck a three-week peak at $1.3289 and to 84.76 pence per euro − a level last seen in May 2017. “Sterling took a nose dive on the back of the Geoffrey Cox statement” said ThinkMarkets analyst Naeem Aslam. “It was his opinion which matters the most; now that he has made it clear that the recent deal has no weight the door is wide open for sterling to move lower.” Rabobank analyst Jane Foley said the despite the volatility the pound remains the best performing G10 currency so far this year. “Even if May’s deal is not passed today (yesterday) the market consensus remains of the view that a hard Brexit will be avoided and this view continues to provide underlying support for the pound.” If the deal was to be voted down MPs will today vote on whether Britain should simply leave on March 29 without any deal at all. London’s stock market meanwhile did well yesterday as is often the case when sterling is weak. Frankfurt closed lower and Paris slightly up. On Wall Street the DJIA index was lower in the early New York afternoon but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both rose. Boeing shares lost more than six per cent on the second day of a rout for the airline’s stock as several governments closed their countries’ airspace to 737 MAX planes and airlines grounded the aircraft following a crash in Ethiopia. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The company that makes British passports will challenge the decision to use a foreign firm in future a government decision that some eurosceptics in the tabloid press have called unpatriotic. Prime Minister Theresa May announced post-Brexit Britain would change its passports from burgundy to blue - closer to how they looked before the colour of EU passports was harmonised in 1988 - in \"an expression of our independence and sovereignty\". But reports that Franco-Dutch firm Gemalto rather than Britain\\'s De La Rue Plc had won the tender to produce them angered some Britons and the Daily Mail said more than 270000 people had signed its petition demanding the contract go to a British company. This has been a rigorous fair and open competition. The preferred bidder demonstrated they are best able to meet the needs of the passport service Gemalto which already produces British driving licences has not confirmed or denied it won the contract but De La Rue has publically criticised the decision to use a foreign firm. It said it would seek a judicial review of the tender decision as it believes it made \"the highest quality and technically most secure bid.\" The Daily Mail applauded De La Rue for \"coming out fighting\" and urged the government to \"put security and patriotism first\" by reversing its decision. A spokesman for May said the standstill period - between a contract being awarded and its final conclusion - had been extended due to De La Rue\\'s request but the government had not changed its stance. \"This has been a rigorous fair and open competition. The preferred bidder demonstrated they are best able to meet the needs of the passport service\" he said. The passport issue has proved uncomfortable for May as she fends off accusation from hardliners in her own party that she will settle for a \"soft\" Brexit deal that could leave Britain still confined by many EU rules which include open competition for public contracts. Anti-Brexit figures have pointed out that Britain had never been obliged to make its passports burgundy and that one EU member Croatia already has blue passports. And in an April Fools joke the European Parliament tweeted on Sunday that the EU had decided to make all EU passports blue. De La Rue\\'s contract which ends in July 2019 is worth 400 million pounds. The new contract will start in October 2019 after Britain leaves the EU in March. Shares in De La Rue were little changed on Tuesday having fallen 6 percent when it said it had lost the contract in March. Britain\\'s biggest trade union Unite said it supported De La Rue\\'s legal challenge as it was concerned about manufacturing jobs. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Farage rode an open-topped double-decker bus and parked up outside the European Commission\\'s building to declare that June 23 will be Britain\\'s \\'Independence Day\\' if the country votes to leave the European Union in the referendum. The bus was adorned with his face UKIP logos and had blaring music. \"We want our borders back. We want our passports back. We want our country back and if everyone that agrees with us goes out to vote on June 23 we will make it UK Independence Day. It\\'s upbeat it\\'s optimistic and we believe we are going to win\" shouted Farage from the top of the purple bus. Brandishing his British-EU passport Farage told the throng of reporters \"We want our passports back we want our borders back.\" Farage argued that the ordinary general public would be better off out of the EU saying the bloc only serves the rich and big business. \"It is the establishment it is the wealthy it is the multi-nationals it is the big banks it is those whose lives have really done rather well in the last few years who are supporting remaining and against it is the people. Against it is the people\" he told reporters.

Owen is in exalted company: Barack Obama warned of dire consequences should we have the temerity to vote leave Jamie Dymon of JP Morgan tried the same tactic and our own erstwhile Chancellor George Osborne warned of an emergency budget if we had the audacity to vote leave. There is a common theme: all these so-called experts have been proven wrong. Our manufacturing order book is at a 30-year high; foreign direct investment in the UK is up £25 billion year on year; pay rose 2.8 per cent in the three months to January 2018; unemployment stands at 3.4 per cent which represents a 40-year low; the pound is up six per cent against the dollar and our currency is the strongest performer among G10 nations.

Speaker John Bercow told MPs that the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill which was passed by MPs and peers on Monday had received its final sign off prompting cheers from the Conservative benches. Mrs May has said she will invoke Article 50 the legal mechanism for withdrawal from the EU by the end of the month in what will be a \"defining moment\" for the country. This will start the clock on a two-year countdown to Britain leaving the EU and launch the country into what are set to be the most complicated negotiations since the Second World War. Britain\\'s future trading relationship with the bloc and any exit bill which it may have to pay are both set to be highly contentious issues in the forthcoming negotiations. The Government managed to get the two-clause Bill through Parliament unamended despite opposition from the House of Lords after a threatened Tory rebellion in the Commons fizzled out. Labour has vowed to continue the battle to guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in the UK and give Parliament a meaningful vote on the deal despite failing to get these pledges attached to the Bill and on to the statute book. The party has tabled two new motions to be debated in the Lords at the end of this month. The first tabled by Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town would require a minister to report back to peers at an early stage on the progress being made in guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals. The second tabled by Labour Lords leader Baroness of Smith of Basildon demands the establishment of a joint committee of the Commons and the Lords \"to consider and report on the terms and options\" for a vote in Parliament on the Brexit deal. Announcing news of the royal assent to MPs on the Commons Mr Bercow said simply: \"I have to notify the House in accordance with the Royal Assent Act 1967 that Her Majesty has signified her royal assent to the following acts: Supply and Appropriation (Anticipation and Adjustments) Act 2017 European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017.\" Labour MP Gisela Stuart who backed Brexit and chaired Vote Leave said: \"This is a simple yet significant step in implementing the referendum result and respecting the decision of the British people to leave the EU. \"Brexit will allow us to begin the process of national renewal enabling us to build a robust economy more cohesive communities and to make politicians more accountable to the public. \"In the weeks and months ahead I would urge politicians from all parties to work together to help ensure we make the most of the opportunities that leaving the EU will provide.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Even their right to remain in the country could be restricted.” There were 6652 British expats in Malta for the 2011 census nearly a third of all foreign residents but there is little concrete information as to how their status – as with that of British residents across the EU – would be affected in the event of a Brexit. The Times of London reported last month that amid the uncertainty some 100 British residents were leaving Spain every day. The pro-EU campaign recently set up a website – register2stay.eu – aimed at providing expats with information about their rights and how to register to vote in the upcoming referendum. “The government has reached out and made it easier to vote abroad but we feel the expat community needs facts and that’s what we’re trying to do” Mr Ramsden said. They would be like any other third-country foreigner British citizens can register to vote if they have been on a UK electoral register at any time within the past 15 years. Those who left the UK before they were 18 years of age can register at their parents’ or guardians’ address as long as they left the country not more than 15 years ago. Applications for overseas postal votes must arrive by May 16 but campaigners are advising voters to register as soon as possible to ensure they make the list. Despite the possibility of Britain leaving the EU Malta’s strong bilateral ties with the UK could ensure that the rights of expats remain largely untouched. On health for example a long-standing reciprocal health agreement between the two countries currently superseded by the European Health Insurance Scheme re-mains in force and would guarantee free healthcare even in the event of a Brexit. Mr Ramsden however warned expats not to submit to the uncertainty of what could prove to be protracted negotiations. “All the noises from the Leave campaign are about restricting the rights of EU migrants in the UK” he said. “We would expect that on the basis of reciprocity British expats in Europe would experience the same thing.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 11th 08:40  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The campaign for Britain to leave the European Union has taken a nine-point lead over the rival ‘in’ campaign according to a poll taken since Prime Minister David Cameron set out his proposals to keep the country in the bloc. The survey by YouGov in the Times newspaper taken in the two days after Cameron set out his proposed changes for Britain’s relationship with the EU represents the biggest lead for the ‘out’ campaign since the referendum wording was agreed last September. The poll showed 45 per cent of Britons would vote to leave the bloc compared with the 36 per cent who want to remain a nine-point gap that was up from the four-point lead the ‘leave’ campaign held last week. Nineteen per cent said they did not know or would not vote. A British exit would shake the Union to its core ripping away its second largest economy and one of its top two military powers. Pro-Europeans warn an exit from the EU would hurt Britain’s economy and could trigger the break-up of the United Kingdom by prompting another Scottish independence vote while opponents of EU membership say Britain would prosper outside. Cameron has spent months trying to secure a deal so that he can campaign to stay in a reformed EU. Last week he set out proposals to restrict benefits to migrants and bring more powers back from Brussels to London. But eurosceptic members of his own party said the deal was far too weak while the country’s press dubbed the proposals a “farce” a “joke” or a “delusion”. If Cameron clinches a deal from other EU leaders at a summit on February 18-19 he could call a referendum as early as June 23. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 14th 09:05  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photom:\\u2008Berm_teerawat/Shutterstock.com  The recent United Kingdom snap general election result has done little to reassure the world that Brexit will not have any negative consequences. One key area where the implications are still murky concerns the sporting sector a sector that year after year is rapidly growing in terms of commercial value and one whose prosperity is significantly under threat unless the right decisions are made which would offer protection to such sector. While the true impact the UK’s withdrawal will have on the professional sporting leagues cannot be pinpointed exactly certain expected impacts can already be noted among them investment and funding opportunities integrity as well as the free movement of players. In terms of investment such impact is already being seen due to the fall the pound currency took immediately after the announcement of the Brexit result. Due to the fall in the pound recruiting players from overseas has become more expensive as was seen in summer 2016 when a world record fee of £89 million was paid by Manchester United for the services of Paul Pogba. In the longer term large-scale projects such as the development or enhancement of sporting facilities could possibly be scaled back or put on hold owing to such currency fall and uncertainty from the Brexit effects. On the other hand such low currency rate could pose as a further incentive for foreign investors to invest in clubs across the UK thus bringing in much needed funds to such clubs to keep their operations running something which is already being seen with the takeover of various clubs such as Nottingham Forest. It is expected that following the UK exit from the EU its membership of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (EUROPOL) will also come to an end. Such agency is key for having cross-border cooperation in tackling match-fixing corruption and doping among other matters all of which are key issues that are at the heart of professional leagues. In the longer term large-scale projects such as the development or enhancement of sporting facilities could possibly be scaled back or put on hold Arguably one of the most significant impacts that will be caused by Brexit concerns possible restrictions on the free movement of players between the UK and the EU and vice-versa. The principle of freedom of movement has been a beneficial contributor towards the steady growth of the UK’s professional leagues; not only to the football leagues but also to the rugby and cricket leagues who have benefited from having players showcasing their talent in their leagues and not being classified as non-EU players. Owing to Brexit landmark principles such as those established in the Bosman ruling are at threat of no longer being applicable to the UK. Owing to the nature of a hard Brexit players who do not have a UK/EU passport or are married to an EU national will no longer benefit from having an automatic right to work in the UK and could be potentially classified as being non-EU players. If this is the case then tough rules would be applicable to them as currently is the case for non-EU players wishing to play in the UK. As a result football players such as N’Golo Kanté and Anthony Martial as well as rugby professional players such as Derrick Appiah all currently deemed to be EU players under their respective association playing rules would not meet such stringent criteria should they suddenly become classified as non-EU players thus not being able to playin the UK. Restrictions would also be imposed on British players who are seeking employment or are currently employed in foreign leagues such as Gareth Bale since they would likely be classified as non-EU players and thus be subjected to needing a work permit therefore no longer be able to benefit from the Bosman effects. This could also affect the playing chances of Maltese footballers currently plying their trade in the English leagues among them Andrea Borg (Peterborough FC) Myles Beerman (Rangers FC) and Sam Magri (Dover Athletic). The UK will also no longer be able to rely upon special agreements such as that of Kolpak or Simutenkov which previously allowed it to have non-EU nationals classified as EU nationals for purposes of their respective sporting leagues. Severe consequences are likely to be seen in the cricket and rugby leagues who benefit mostly from such type of players among them South Africans. A possible restriction that could apply with respect to the football league is that British football clubs would no longer be able to benefit from the exception provided for in Article 19 of Fifa’s regulations on the status and transfer of players concerning international transfers of players aged between 16 to 18. This could be seen as having severe consequences for such clubs due to the fact that investing in young talent is often seen as being low-risk and at the same possibly reaping a higher reward in the following years. This could also have an adverse effect on the UK club’s abilities to qualify their EU players as being home-grown for purposes of European competitions. Without a doubt sporting associations and clubs will be spending the ‘quieter’ summer months in endless negotiations with the British government to try and ensure the best deal is reached with Brussels especially when it comes to freedom of movement concerning its players. When such deal does effectively come about is another question. For the time being and the next two years of negotiations at least it is business as usual but with an uncertain future.

Regardless of how it may affect their lives EU citizens living in the UK will have no say in whether the country decides to leave the EU in the historic ‘Brexit’ referendum in June – except that is for the Maltese. Along with Cyprus Maltese citizens currently living in the UK will be eligible to vote in the upcoming referendum taking advantage of a contentious historical quirk which allows Commonwealth citizens to vote in all UK ballots. With nearly a million Commonwealth citizens in the country the combined vote could have a significant effect and attempts to sway it one way or the other have already begun. Former Prime Minister Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici last week appealed to Maltese people in the UK to vote to leave assuring them a Brexit would not cause any problems for them or for Malta as a country. Of those who spoke to The Sunday Times of Malta however many showed a lot more uncertainty about what the referendum result may mean for them and their fellow Maltese expats. “If the UK leaves the EU it will be much harder for me to live and work here” said Fabian Micallef studying for a PhD in Cambridge and planning to vote ‘in’. “Others who want to study here would find it basically impossible without a strong financial backing from home. Unfortunately as a developed country in the Commonwealth we don’t get too many financial benefits from the UK.” According to reports the threat of a Brexit has had some UK citizens scrambling to obtain citizenship in other EU countries; but some Maltese people are doing the opposite shoring up their British credentials to guard against any eventualities. Celine Grech who has lived in the UK for 12 years is one of them having applied for and obtained British citizenship last year as the shadow of the referendum loomed. “I am likely to vote ‘in’ as my gut feeling is that the EU would give Britain a hard time to be part of the European Economic Area (EEA)” she said. “Also I would prefer Britain to have a say within the EU rather than be a voice on the outside. I feel that the UK counterbalances and provides a voice for other states when faced with France and Germany.” Not all Maltese voters are as keen to remain in the EU along with their home country. Many particularly dual-citizens and those who have lived in the UK a long time told this newspaper they would be voting ‘out’ largely citing the same concerns as other British-born ‘out’ voters. Despite many being immigrants themselves the strain of migration on British society and social services was a consistent concern along with anger at being led from Brussels and losing national sovereignty in their adopted country. “My main concern is control: being allowed to say no being able to close borders or refuse entry” said Jason Cassar who has dual citizenship. “I think the EU is all right but our government should be able to say ‘this isn’t working’ and restrict whatever aspect is causing problems.” Others however said the biggest problem they faced was a lack of concrete information – amidst the broad statements and scaremongering – to help inform their vote. “Yes staying would make it easier to work here without a visa or some kind of document but it may not be in our favour anyway because of the benefits that we will be losing following David Cameron’s deal” said Marie-Claire Aquilina. “Personally I would like to have more factual information on how the result will affect us before committing.” Maltese people over the age of 18 (16 in Scotland) living in the UK can register to vote any time before the deadline on June 7. Voters in England Scotland and Wales can register online: gov.uk/register-to-vote or sending a form by post to their local electoral registration office. Paper forms can be found online or from the local electoral registration office. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 14th 09:05  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Think tank New Financial has scoured through hundreds of speeches articles and reports from the EU27 in an attempt to distil what policymakers and regulators in each member state really think about Brexit. Here is a 10-point summary of the main findings indicating the countries that specifically mentioned the relevant issue. 1. Politics first Maintaining the unity of the EU and the integrity of the single market is the overwhelming priority of the majority of EU27 countries. The UK will not be allowed to pick and choose between the four freedoms (movement of people capital goods and services) and many countries are prepared to put politics ahead of economics. Nothing will be agreed in any sector until everything has been agreed in all sectors. (Germany France EU institutions Malta Italy Spain the Netherlands Luxembourg Belgium Sweden Austria Bulgaria Czech Republic Denmark Estonia Latvia Slovakia Slovenia) 2. Tough talking The UK will face a tough negotiation process with the three most important groups: Germany France and EU institutions. Many of the UK’s closest friends are already adopting a relatively hard stance. While there is little appetite to ‘punish’ the UK the stance of some countries has hardened in recent months in response to ‘hard Brexit’ and the talk in the UK of ‘no deal is better than a bad deal’. (Germany France EU institutions Sweden Denmark Malta Italy Spain The Netherlands Luxembourg Belgium Austria Bulgaria Czech Republic Denmark Slovenia) 3. An imperfect alternative There is an almost universal view in the EU27 that a deal based on equivalence (allowing firms based in the UK to continue to access EU markets based on broadly equivalent regulation) would not be appropriate and very few policymakers in the EU have expressed public support for the sort of ‘enhanced equivalence’ regime that the UK has floated. Access to the single market from London will be strictly controlled. Most – but not all – countries accept the need for a transitional deal but only for a short period and on the condition that the UK falls under EU jurisdiction during that period. (Germany France EU institutions Italy Luxembourg Belgium Sweden) 4. A focus on financial stability The main concern of most supervisors and regulators in the EU27 is financial stability and close cooperation with the UK authorities post-Brexit given the high level of financial integration between the UK and EU27. Many supervisors are insisting on firms having a substantial local presence as part of any relocation and any deal on financial services should include shared oversight of euro-denominated trading and clearing while some countries are pushing for enforced physical relocation of these activities. (Germany France EU institutions The Netherlands Ireland Luxembourg Slovakia) 5. The future of the City Most countries accept that London will continue as the dominant financial centre in Europe post-Brexit but that a range of financial centres in the rest of the EU will benefit from the relocation of some UK-based business. The UK will lose influence in financial policymaking: there is growing support in the rest of the EU to accelerate the integration of supervision regulation and market infrastructure across the EU27. (Germany EU institutions Spain The Netherlands Ireland Luxembourg Belgium Sweden Austria) 6. Competing for business The UK faces a wide range of competition for business in different sectors post-Brexit. Some countries (such as France Ireland Italy Luxembourg and Poland) are actively pitching for firms to relocate offering tax breaks and other incentives. Others such as Germany the Netherlands and Sweden are taking a more passive approach to competition. Everyone agrees that some relocation of UK-based activity will be required. (Germany France Ireland Italy Luxembourg the Netherlands Sweden Poland Spain Belgium Austria Portugal) 7. An expensive rebalancing act Brexit will lead to a potentially healthy rebalancing of financial markets activity across the EU as no single financial centre will be able to attract or accommodate all of the business that moves from the UK. This will be accompanied by an increase in the cost and complexity of financial activity due to duplication and relocation – but that is seen as an unfortunate but necessary political trade-off. (Germany France EU institutions The Netherlands Luxembourg Italy Sweden) 8. A weaker hand The importance of the City to the EU economy is not as a strong a card as many in the UK might have hoped. EU27 member states recognise the asymmetric trade-off between the importance to the UK of its financial services exports to the EU and the import of goods from the EU. An agreement on financial services will be the hardest part of trade talks and getting a deal for the City is more important to the UK than to the rest of the EU. The EU27 knows that the UK needs a deal on financial services and really wants one on trade in goods. (Germany France EU institutions Malta Spain Belgium Sweden Austria Cyprus Denmark Greece Portugal) 9. A tortuous process Negotiations will be more complex and more political than the UK media suggests and will require a lot of give and take. While the EU27 is keen to arrange a trade deal an agreement on services will be tougher because the jobs control and value remain with the country that hosts the service providers. The formal negotiations period under Article 50 will be less than two years once you take the approval of EU institutions and member states into account but few people in the EU27 expect a deal to be agreed in less than two years. (Germany France EU institutions Ireland Belgium Sweden Austria Croatia Czech Republic) 10. A race to the bottom? Any suggestion that the UK would aim to attract business post-Brexit through deregulation or a more aggressive tax policy would be seen as a direct threat to the EU27 and trigger a tough response. The UK cannot set lower taxes to attract business because it needs tax revenues for its budget deficit and will have to adhere to global norms such as OECD guidelines.

Photo: Peter Nicholls/Reuters  Shockwaves from Britain’s vote to leave the European Union are reverberating through the economy with surveys published yesterday showing a dive in consumer confidence and a slowdown in construction. Preparing for a Brexit-related slowdown Lloyds Banking Group said it would cut 3000 jobs and one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships Inchcape predicted growth in new car registrations would slow. Just over a month after the referendum the latest signals of an economic slowdown are likely to fuel expectations of action from the Bank of England on August 4 when many economists believe it will cut interest rates and might start buying bonds again. An index of consumer confidence plunged nearly five points to 106.6 in July – matching its biggest fall in six years and hitting its lowest level since 2013 polling firm YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) said. “The public is still absorbing the EU referendum result but it is clear that consumer confidence has taken a significant and clear dive” Stephen Harmston head of YouGov Reports said. People are particularly worried about what will happen to the value of their homes People are particularly worried about what will happen to the value of their homes the survey found. House price growth edged up in July but the data might not yet reflect any impact from the referendum because of a lag mortgage lender Nationwide said. Economists say spending by consumers offers the best hope that Britain can avoid a Brexit-related recession. But retailers said sales fell sharply after the referendum according to a survey published on Wednesday. In construction growth in activity slowed after the vote the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said. Contributors to a RICS survey predicted a one per cent rise in workloads over the next 12 months down from growth of 2.8 per cent that they had foreseen in the first quarter. Britain’s property market has been one of the worst hit sectors since the referendum with housebuilders seeing their market values plunge while investors pulled out cash from commercial funds forcing many to be suspended. Construction firms cut back their forecasts for hiring mirroring moves by British retailers who reported the fastest fall in full-time equivalent employment in two years in the second quarter as the referendum approached. But a survey by the British Retail Consortium showed 93 per cent of retailers intended to keep staffing levels unchanged in the next three months compared with 83 per cent in the second quarter of last year. A third survey published yesterday showed pay awards in Britain stuck in a slow gear. Median pay settlements in the three months to the end of June were worth 1.8 per cent for a third month in a row after a two-year run during which increases of two per cent had become the norm according to XpertHR an online human resources firm. “It remains to be seen how the uncertainty around the impact of the Brexit vote will feed through to pay settlements but we are likely to see pay awards remaining subdued for many months to come” XpertHR’s Sheila Attwood said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

We kindly ask you to take a few minutes to read and understand them.   Last week Michel Barnier and I sat down for the first time to begin negotiating the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union. I have been clear that our first priority is to provide certainty to EU citizens living in the UK and to UK citizens living in the EU. I’m pleased that the EU has agreed this is one of the first issues we will address – and yesterday the UK published a detailed policy document explaining our offer. Three million EU citizens including 31000 Maltese have made the UK their home. They have contributed to the very fabric of Britain. And they deserve to look at their futures with as much certainty as possible. We welcome the fact that there are around 1000 Maltese students attending UK universities – from London to Bristol Swansea and Glasgow. So with Brexit negotiations starting last week I will outline the UK’s offer to secure the rights of these people we value so much. And it is only fair we secure an agreement with the EU that protects over a million UK nationals in the EU including the 9000 or so British nationals who live in Malta in a similar reciprocal way. \\xa0 We want to guarantee the status of EU citizens already living in the UK and enable them to continue to live their lives broadly as now. \\xa0 We will treat EU citizens equally and will not discriminate between nationals of different member states. Our intention is to enable law-abiding EU citizens who have settled in the UK before an agreed date to apply for settled status under British law along with their families. The UK believes this date should be no earlier than March 29 2017 and no later than when Britain officially leaves the EU. As long as they want to stay living here they will see no immigration conditions placed on their residency. We will make it simple for those Maltese who have made their lives in the UK to stay That means people will be able to work and study in the UK freely. They’ll be able to claim benefits and pensions and apply for social housing on the same basis as UK citizens. Why are we doing this? Because it is the right thing to do. We’ll continue to welcome people whether in the EU or outside the EU who want to come to Britain work hard and contribute. There will also be a ‘grace’ period between the moment the UK leaves the EU and the time people obtain their residence document to avoid a legal gap between the end of free movement rights and people from the EU getting settled status in Britain. It means EU citizens will be able to remain lawfully in the UK during this interim period and that we can bridge any gap for people waiting for their residency documentation to come through. We intend to introduce a voluntary scheme to enable eligible EU citizens to apply for their residence document before the UK leaves the EU – thus reducing uncertainty and making Brexit as smooth and efficient as possible for EU residents here. It is a fair and serious offer that rightly recognises the invaluable contribution EU citizens have made to the UK. Over the past year as I’ve spoken to leaders across Europe it has become clear that securing citizens rights and offering them peace of mind is a priority for both sides. I recognise that there has been considerable uncertainty for some of you and your family and friends in the UK. This situation has not been helped by a number of myths about our approach. These range from suggestions that the UK was going to take draconian action to remove Maltese nationals from the UK once we leave. Or that we would design a process so complicated that it discouraged people from Malta from staying here beyond our withdrawal. This is something I want to correct now. The UK is a tolerant open and diverse country. We will continue to be just that. We will make it simple for those Maltese who have made their lives in the UK to stay. We welcome the contribution you have made to our country. I’ve no doubt this is achievable. We will continue to welcome your citizens to our shores after Brexit. We’ll continue to buy your goods sell you ours and the 500000 Brits who visit Malta every year will continue to holiday in your beautiful country. Brexit is far from the end of our relationship – it is simply a new chapter in it. There’s something very special about the UK-Malta relationship that we must make sure we preserve. We share so many aims and values and our histories are closely intertwined. Our ties run deep both at a bilateral level and internationally including through our membership of the Commonwealth. Brexit will not change this; indeed I expect us to forge even closer links in the coming months and years. I hope this offer demonstrates the fair and serious way we intend to conduct these negotiations and the deep and special partnership we now want with Malta and the EU.

For months the EU and UK have been negotiating a withdrawal agreement that in turn would open up a transition period until December 2020 to allow additional time to forge out a new relationship between the two parties. Unfortunately negotiations for long have been frustrated by internal domestic disputes in the UK on the nature of the future relationship with the EU; an intrinsic battle between ‘remainers’ ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ Brexiteers. The EU-UK future relationship is also tangled with the Irish border question that needs to be addressed in the withdrawal agreement and thus makes it more urgent. On its part the EU has been strong on the principle that the Single Market’s four freedoms are indivisible. If a Withdrawal Agreement is not concluded and ratified by March 29 2019 unless negotiations are unanimously extended no transition would take place and EU law would cease to apply to the UK as of immediately. This so-called ‘no-deal’ or ‘cliff-edge’ scenario would also mean that EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU would have no specific arrangement in place. In such event the EU and UK would have to apply respective regulations and tariffs at borders as applied to third countries including for customs declarations and sanitary and phytosanitary standards. With regard to trade and regulatory issues the EU and UK relations would be then governed by World Trade Organisation rules that are by far the most basic and least advantageous considering the voluminous trade that goes on between the two blocs. Moreover UK and EU entities would no longer be eligible to participate in respective public procurement. A ‘no deal’ scenario will also have implications on consumer rights. While businesses and consumers will still be able to resort to the jurisdiction of their habitual residence in claims against UK traders after the withdrawal it will be ultimately up to the UK government to recognise and enforce EU court judgments independently and voluntarily. There will also be implications on package travel for instance. EU rules oblige traders to take out insolvency protection to refund or repatriate consumers in case of bankruptcy. As the package travel directive will no longer apply to the UK EU citizens that purchase services from UK traders will not have such safeguards unless the traders actively sell to the EU market. In that case the same obligations continue to apply.\\xa0 Another concerning consequence of Brexit is that the UK would fall out of the Open-Skies Agreement EU passengers’ rights will only continue to hold for travellers flying on EU registered carriers. In other words passengers flying from the UK to any EU country and vice-versa on an EU airline will be covered by EU passengers’ rights while passengers flying on a UK airline shall not. The UK could introduce new rights for UK carriers but the level of protection may differ. Another concerning consequence of Brexit is that the UK would fall out of the Open-Skies Agreement and unless a separate deal is struck on aviation effectively flights between the two blocs will be grounded. Although unlikely the EU has not discarded the option of introducing a visa requirement for UK citizens in case of a ‘no deal’. Undoubtedly this ‘cliff-edge’ scenario would cause disruptions leading to serious repercussions on citizens businesses and administrations. There are numerous measures that businesses can take to prepare themselves for Brexit. Actions of course differ depending on the company’s commercial activity and sector in which it operates. To mention a few businesses who rely on certificates licences or authorisation issued by UK authorities will need to transfer or seek new ones issued by any of the EU-27-based ones. On rules of origin UK input to the finalised product will no longer be considered as EU content thus businesses will have to re-examine their supply chain and start treating any UK input as ’non-originating’. Businesses trading with the UK will also need to ensure compliance with the EU’s export and import prohibitions and restrictions to protect health and safety and the environment. Similarly companies that are currently transmitting personal data to the UK will be subject to specific conditions set out in EU law as this will become a transfer of personal data to a third country. Citizens holding a professional qualification obtained in the UK should consider whether it is advisable to obtain the recognition of a professional qualification in the EU27 while the UK is still a Member State. While Brexit would only take effect after March 29 2019 a withdrawal agreement is required by mid-November the latest to allow sufficient time for a ‘fast-track’ ratification process to take place in the EU. As the clock continues ticking on the EU and UK to close a deal business operators and professionals with interests in the UK market are invited to be informed and prepare for any eventuality that the departure of the UK will unavoidably bring to avoid any disruption that could potentially come into effect as soon as six months from now.

Most major British firms are seriously considering the risk of Britain leaving the European Union and many are making contingency plans according to the head of the Confederation of British Industry. Speaking to reporters CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said the prospect of a British referendum around the middle of the year on whether to leave the EU was a growing concern for business. Prime Minister David Cameron hopes to reach a deal to reform the European Union at a summit of EU leaders this weekend which he can put to voters in a referendum many analysts expect to be held in late June. Recent opinion polls have shown a narrow but growing lead for campaigners who want to leave the EU. “You are now seeing a number of companies recently that have had contingency plans (and) are debating important questions of what it means for their suppliers and their exports and so on” Fairbairn said.“I would say it is most now that have given the issue serious thought” she added based on having met almost 100 businesses since she took the CBI’s helm in November. No firms have spoken publicly in any detail about how they would react if Britain decided to leave the 28-member bloc and had to renegotiate a raft of global trade deals.But behind closed doors some companies – including major international banks based in London’s financial district – have spent tens of millions of dollars considering their options according to firms advising them. Fairbairn’s comments show contingency planning is now common and she said it was not concentrated in any one sector. The Bank of England has confirmed that it has looked at what might happen if Britain voted to leave the EU although Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has said the government is wholly focused on ensuring reform of the bloc. The CBI said most of its members wanted to stay in a reformed EU and it has generally pointed to the benefits of staying in drawing criticism from ‘leave’ campaigners. Last week the CBI said firms’ investment intentions had not been affected by the prospect of the vote. But at the briefing Fairbairn said this could change given Scotland’s experience of a referendum on independence in 2014. “We are not surprised not to see an impact now” she said. “One of the things we saw from the Scottish referendum is that those decisions around investment tended to be quite late at the point at which a date was actually announced.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Representatives were told that the United Kingdom would be exiting the EU with no deal on April 12 if the House of Commons did not manage to agree on an alternative by the 11th of that month. If UK Prime Minister Theresa May managed to obtain the Commons’ support for her deal before the 11th the UK would have until May 23 to exit the European Union.\\xa0 Read: Parliament support 'not sufficient' for third Brexit vote - May The European Council’s group of 27 member states had decided to proffer these two deadlines so as to ensure that the final decision on Brexit was taken by the United Kingdom and not by the European Union Dr Muscat said.\\xa0 “The deadlines also sent the message that it was time for decisions to be taken” he added. Dr Muscat said work was underway to modify a legal notice intended to permit the Electoral Commission to remove British citizens who would no longer be EU citizens after the original Brexit date of March 29 from the electoral register ahead of the European Parliament elections in May.\\xa0 “Efforts were underway to prepare for all possible scenarios” he said. “Malta’s plans for a no-deal Brexit had been described by the European Commission as “excellent” and were among the most generous to UK citizens” Dr Muscat added. Opposition leader Adrian Delia criticised the fact that small businesses had been left in the dark about the consequences of either a no-deal Brexit or Brexit following the Commons’ endorsement of Ms May’s deal.\\xa0 Read:\\xa0UK government has 300 no-deal Brexit contingency plans One concern was the effect that a no-deal Brexit would have on promises of sale in effect between Maltese sellers and British buyers he said.\\xa0 Dr Delia asked Dr Muscat to explain whether Malta’s position on tax harmonisation would be weakened within the EU following Brexit as the UK had consistently supported Malta’s position against harmonisation.

Cartoonist: Ciril Horjak. \" As the results came in it struck me that the story of Icarus is the story of Europe.\"  Cartoonists from all across Europe have sketched their interpretation of what it means to form part of the European Union in light of looming threat to its unity following Brexit. The cartoons by cartoonists from 28 leading news media houses – including Times of Malta cartoonist Seb Tanti Burlò – are an artistic take on the EU’s current situation. The cartoons are being published by Danish newspaper Politiken on Sunday. They will also be on display in the lobby of the newspaper’s headquarters in Copenhagen and will serve to mark the informal summit being held tomorrow in Bratislava Slovakia. The European leaders will be convening in Slovakia which currently holds the EU presidency to discuss issues related to the theme ‘The future of the EU’. Alongside the cartoons Politiken will also be publishing an appeal to the 28 EU leaders urging them to work for unity in a time of division the newspaper said. It will also be encouraging the idea that the power of community is stronger than nationalism or populism a design editor for Politiken said. “Let’s stop focusing only on what divides us and instead pay full attention to all the things that unite us” the editor said. \\xa0  Malta - Times of MaltaCartoonist: Sebastian Tanti Burlò “Europe is fat. She is not the beauty she once was. Her people have become lethargic and apathetic resembling sausages more than the people they were. They are distant from the ideal of a united Europe the result of years of alienation and bureaucracy” “Brexit is a shining example of this public alienation. The British people were conned and the European people have no idea what is going to happen. The unknown creates fear – this fear strengthens nationalism for we will run to the familiar rather than turn to the unknown.” \\xa0  Ireland - The Irish TimesCartoonist: Martyn Turner. \"The future of Europe ... well it will of course be riven with misunderstanding and confusion. Take my cartoon for example. They ain’t sheep. They’re lemmings creatures who mythically commit suicide from time to time by jumping off a cliff.\" \"Someone else who thought they were sheep was the chief panjandrum of the Ukip Leave campaign. He asked if they could reprint the cartoon on some of their campaign literature. It suited him to think that being opposed to austerity naturally made you opposed to Europe. He was wrong on that score as he is pretty much wrong on every other score.\" \\xa0  Croatia - 24sataCartoonist: Nik Titanik “I come from a small country and for us it can seem dramatic when the big countries pull away. And I wanted to poke fun at the British hypocrisy. They want to be independent but they still want all the benefits from the EU. But they hate the EU! I do not get it.” \\xa0  Germany - Die Zeit Cartoonist: Jochen Schievink “The illustration was made under the impression that more and more countries are trying to fillet the EU into pieces to get the best parts out of it – even if they risk to kill the whole thing.” \\xa0  \\xa0 \\xa0 Latvia - Diena Cartoonist: Zemgus Zaharans “Before the euro was introduced in Latvia we also had a high-value currency like the British. It was a full-bodied currency. I saw the British decision to take the road to Brexit – which is a dead-end – as a sign that the British pound is likely to lose some weight.” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0  Cyprus - Politis Cartoonist: Thanasis Papaspyropoulos “I see Europe as it should be and Europe as it is. Blind apprehensive and reactionary. We create Europe. We decide which way to go. We need to go back to the roots of the original European project. It was beautiful and simple but also fragile. That is what I want to show. We are responsible for the current situation and it is our responsibility not to let ourselves be dragged to bottom by fear and ignorance.” \\xa0  Spain - El Mundo Cartoonist: Ricardo & Julio Rey “We had this idea of doing something with the English lion. Proud and majestic. It seemed that the lion had been misled by irresponsible politicians and lured into voting about something they did not know the nature of. “They got caught on the way to this so-called independence. But the British are greater than their politicians.” \\xa0  Finland - Helsingin Sanomat Cartoonist: Ville Tietäväinen “I wanted to show a European wholeness that is recognisable but clearly inoperative because it is a cubist jumble. I decided to use a classical European instrument – but one that cannot be played. The violin represents the most classical European tradition of playing together. The chin rest is detached from the instrument so as to resemble Great Britain.” \\xa0  Slovakia - SMECartoonist: Mandor \"Literally the time was my inspiration. I was sketching ideas on Brexit cartoons and checked the time. I have a Monty Python’s ’Ministry of Silly Walks’-styled clock on the wall. Immediately this picture appeared in my head.\"\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

For this to happen the UK needs to put into effect Article 50 of the Treaty by formally advising the other member states of the Union that it wishes to leave. Then there will be a period of negotiations. In the meantime two of the three main faces of the Leave campaign have left the UK political scene. Nigel Farage the leader of UKIP has resigned while Boris Johnson touted by many as the next prime minister following the resignation of David Cameron withdrew from the leadership race of the Conservative Party. The third face Michael Gove performed very badly in the first round of this race. So the activation of Article 50 is awaiting the appointment of a new Prime Minister which will happen some time around the end of summer. Even if the UK formally informs the other member states of its intention to leave the EU one wonders what its strategy would be. It will try to have the proverbial cake and eat it. On the other hand the other member states are not likely to allow that to happen. So while the process of UK’s exit from the EU is still awaiting its start the three largest economies – Germany France and Italy – have been busy putting forward their views on what reforms they would like to see in the EU. All proposals are economic in nature. Each country was probably hoping to catch the others by surprise and obtain assent. Since the situation remains very unclear one cannot even start to understand what the impact on Malta shall be Germany is proposing to transfer the power of supervising the expenditure of the European Commission to another authority which is very inflexible. Germany is hoping to cut down on unnecessary expenditure in the Commission which it had already sought to do during the budgeting process. This would then be followed by another push towards fiscal austerity. France is paying lip service to the German proposal in the hope that Germany finally accepts to allow France more flexibility on the fiscal front in tackling its chronic economic challenges. Italy’s agenda includes providing support to banks that find themselves in difficulty following the application of the new capital requirements. As if this were not enough a number of member states from Eastern Europe have issued a joint statement asking for the European Commission to be placed under the control of the member states. This would help to avoid decisions that may make national governments unpopular while the decision-makers – the president of the European Commission and the commissioners – remain distant from the citizens’ disgruntlement. It continues to be evident that there is a divergence of opinion regarding the timing of Brexit. While Angela Merkel the German Chancellor continues to insist that there is no need to accelerate the Brexit process (probably in the hope that the UK rethinks its position) the European Commission is insisting on an immediate start to negotiations and embarking on a road of no return. Thus the various member states (and I think I would exclude Malta in this but I have no knowledge of Malta’s position) keep pushing their national agenda in conflict with the agenda of the other members. Since the situation remains very unclear one cannot even start to understand what the impact on Malta shall be. We know there will be some negative consequences and some opportunities to exploit. We need to choose our position very carefully as wrong moves could threaten the stability of our economy. Poll after poll show that the Maltese are very much pro-EU and have a strong belief in the European project. Hence stability in the EU is a necessity for us. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters  If the British people vote for Brexit there will be all sorts of complications: never before has a country left the EU. It is really much easier said than done. The UK would need to enter into negotiations (probably very lengthy ones) on a new agreement that would regulate relations between it and the EU. One wonders how tough the stance adopted by the negotiators on the EU side would be. So the prospect of a Brexit could have political implications that would be more serious than the economic ones. However there needs to be a serious analysis of the economic impact on both our country and the EU as a whole if the UK were to leave the EU – and if the UK were to stay in the EU under the new conditions. Given that one is speaking about hypothetical situations such an assessment is always difficult. Moreover it is easier to identify the costs of either decision but far more difficult to identify benefits. If Britain were to leave the EU one would need to understand what would happen to the millions of persons from the other EU member states working in the UK. Technically they would need employment permits. What sort of employment permits would the UK government be willing to grant? Can the UK economy do without such workers? The aspiration has always been to create a union of people and it must remain so On the other hand one can also imagine the impact on the economy of the countries these workers come from if they were forced to leave the UK. Today these workers send remittances to their country of origin. If they were forced to return they would become a very heavy burden on their country’s finances. If they choose to relocate to another member state which country/ies would they go to? Could other member states absorb these workers? And what if they ended up living on social benefits as they have done in the UK? If we take our country as an example I believe that given our size and given the significant number of non-Maltese persons already working in Malta our absorptive capacity has reached its limit. These are the questions that arise from just one aspect – employment. Another aspect would be the funding of the EU. The UK had renegotiated its contribution to the EU budget during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher but remained a net contributor to the EU. If the British decide to leave the UK how would that impact the EU budget? Will the European Social Fund the European Regional Development Fund and similar funds have to reduce their transfers to the other member states? In other words would there be less money flowing from the EU to the member states? How would the additional financial burden for the EU member states be shared? How would Malta be affected in such a situation? If the British people were to vote to leave the EU would there be increased pressure to change the taxation rules in the EU? Will there be a stronger drive to achieve tax harmonisation that is having the same taxation rules across the EU? If so then the impact on Malta may be a very negative one. We would need to introduce VAT on food items which so far are tax exempt thanks to a derogation we had obtained on entry into the EU. Our financial services sector would lose a great deal of its attraction. There are other issues to consider such as the impact on exports and imports and the impact on the tourism sector. A British exit from the EU would impact these as well. And the list is not exhaustive. I have also not mentioned anything about the impact of the UK staying in under the new conditions. One hopes that while the British mull their country’s way forward there are studies being undertaken on the impact of both a Brexit decision and a “stay in” decision. Either way the EU governments need to keep in mind that the aspiration has always been to create a union of people and it must remain so. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Thursday’s EU referendum in the UK will determine whether Britain remains a member of the EU – and the result will have far-reaching consequences not only for the UK but for Europe and the whole world. Unfortunately most of the opinion polls of late have been showing the Leave bloc to be ahead so a once unthinkable Brexit is now a very real possibility. Concerns over EU migration – which are very often exaggerated – coupled with traditional old-fashioned British antagonism towards Europe probably explains why those wanting to quit the EU are ahead in the polls. The EU is not a perfect organisation but it has been a remarkable success story for all its members and Britain is no exception. The UK’s membership has led to economic growth job creation lower prices greater rights for workers the right to live work and study abroad funding for the arts science and the regions environmental protection greater security and a leading role for Britain not only in Europe but on the international stage. The UK has also helped shape the EU for the better. It has long been a champion of the Single Market it has offered a counterweight to the German-French partnership within the bloc and its membership of the EU gives the Union extra clout globally. Britain has also managed to get the best of both worlds in the EU; it is not part of the single currency or the Schengen agreement and it has a number of important opt-outs. A Brexit would put all this at risk. Sterling has fallen considerably ever since the Leave side starting gaining in the polls and a vote to leave the EU would almost certainly see the pound crash. The overwhelming majo\\xadrity of British economists businesses and trade unionists have warned of negative economic consequences should the UK decide to leave; so have the experts at the IMF the OECD and the Treasury as well as the G7 and the Commonwealth nations. A victory for the Leave side could also lead to the breakup of the UK with Scotland and perhaps also Wales opting for independence and separate EU membership. In such a scenario it is not difficult to imagine the negative consequences on Northern Ireland and the undermining of the peace process which Britain and Ireland both EU members have worked so hard to achieve. Prime Minister David Cameron who is strongly urging a vote for the Remain side and whose Conservative Party is split down the middle on the country’s EU membership took a huge gamble when he decided to call this referendum. He had promised it only to satisfy his eurosceptic backbenchers and ministers and for an electoral advantage. Furthermore years of ferocious attacks and nonsense stories in the tabloid press against the EU have certainly taken their toll on the average British citizen’s mindframe as has the habit mainly by Conservative politicians of making Brussels the scapegoat for the country’s problems. The consequences of a Brexit on Europe would be profound. It would create an institutional crisis and uncertainty in the markets. It would rob the bloc of one of its best and largest members – the UK’s economy is the fifth largest in the world and the second largest in Europe. It would encourage other like-minded anti-EU movements. Europe’s foreign and security policy would also be severely weakened – the UK is a nuclear power and a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Malta would lose one of its best friends in the EU with whom it shares many common interests. Even though the polls are not looking good for the Remain side all is not yet lost. There are still a large number of undecided voters – who normally vote for the status quo – and a three per cent swing among Labour Party voters is all that is needed for the Remain bloc to win. Every effort must be made up to the last day of the campaign to mobilise potential Remain voters. There is simply too much at stake. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Eleven climate change protesters stripped off in Britain\\'s House of Commons on Monday during another lengthy debate about Brexit chastising MPs for ignoring the urgent environmental needs of the planet. \"I\\'m tired of the time and resources our government wastes rearranging the deckchairs on the Brexitanic\" Iggy Fox a 24-year-old wildlife biologist and one of the protesters said in a statement. Mark Ovland 35 said: \"We are impelled to act in this way because the most important and pressing issue of our time is being flagrantly and recklessly ignored.\" The protesters carried out their protest in the chamber\\'s public gallery stripping down to their underwear as MPs debated the merits of different Brexit strategies below. Some of them wore thongs and pressed their naked buttocks against a glass partition as MPs stared but House of Commons Speaker John Bercow did not interrupt proceedings. They had slogans like \"SOS\" and \"Stop Wasting Time!\" painted on their bodies. Some also glued their hands to a glass partition making it harder for security guards to remove them. Two of the group wore full grey body paint and elephant masks to make the point that the climate crisis had become an \"elephant in the room\" for British politicians. Semi-naked climate protesters have attempted to disrupt a Brexit debate in the Commons but were thwarted by soundproof glass https://t.co/JAXereXJ1e pic.twitter.com/DTgFBJUAT0 The political crisis over Brexit has gripped Britain allowing little government time for other issues. The protest was organised by Extinction Rebellion a British group which has staged a number of high-profile demonstrations in recent weeks. British lawmakers will try once again Monday to agree a new approach to Brexit after rejecting Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s divorce deal for a third time. Brussels has set an April 12 deadline to agree the divorce terms May has struck with the bloc find an alternative or crash out of the European Union. The House of Commons held a first round of votes last week on various Brexit options but failed to agree and is now hoping to produce a clearer result on Monday. The main opposition Labour Party is backing two proposals which would keep Britain close to the EU after Brexit but both would face strong resistance from May and most of her Brexit-backing ministers.

The British government denied Wednesday it was secretly plotting to force MPs into a last-minute choice on Brexit between a rejigged deal or a lengthy delay. ITV television reported that it had overheard Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s chief Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins in a Brussels bar saying the European Union would probably let Britain extend its March 29 departure date. Such a move would effectively mean removing the possibility of Britain leaving the EU without a deal. ITV reported that it eavesdropped on Robbins one of the key figures in the Brexit negotiations talking to colleagues in a hotel bar on Monday. He was said to have indicated that if lawmakers - who overwhelmingly rejected the deal struck between London and Brussels - did not vote for a rehashed withdrawal agreement then the delay to Brexit would be \"a long one\". \"The issue is whether Brussels is clear on the terms of extension. In the end they will probably just give us an extension\" he was quoted as saying. \\'A private conversation\\' \"Got to make them believe that the week beginning end of March... Extension is possible but if they don\\'t vote for the deal then the extension is a long one.\" The government insists it is working towards leaving the EU on time with a deal in place. A government spokesman said: \"We would not comment on alleged remarks from a private conversation which is said to have been overheard in a hotel bar.\" Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay denied the reported Robbins comments reflected official government policy. \"We are committed to leaving on March 29\" he told BBC radio. \"It is not in anyone\\'s interest to have an extension without any clarity.\" May on Tuesday asked MPs for more time to try and revive the Brexit deal in what the opposition said was a ploy to \"run down the clock\". She said the talks were at a crucial stage and MPs needed to hold their nerve to get changes to the withdrawal agreement -- notably the insurance provisions on keeping the border with Ireland free-flowing. Keir Starmer the main opposition Labour Party\\'s Brexit spokesman said Wednesday that May was stringing parliament along \"pretending there\\'s progress\". Labour has tabled an amendment for debate in parliament on Thursday which would force the government to either put a deal to a vote by February 27 or allow parliament to take control of the Brexit process. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Sterling tumbled yesterday and a gauge of global stocks declined for a sixth straight session as political developments in Britain rippled through currency bond and equity markets. Wall Street’s main stock indexes opened lower after mixed corporate earnings. Oil prices rose as they continued to recoup some losses form a recent steep plunge. In Britain Prime Minister Theresa May battled to save a draft divorce deal with the European Union after her Brexit secretary and other ministers quit in protest and lawmakers stepped up efforts to topple her. Sterling was last trading at $1.2765 down 1.76 per cent on the day and also fell steeply against the euro. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.62 per cent while Britain’s FTSE 250 dropped 2.0 per cent. “Risk appetite has taken a hit across the board as this breakdown comes just as Italy ramps up its standoff with Brussels and investors continue to fret that the great boom in tech earnings has come to an end” said Chris Beauchamp chief market analyst at IG. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 257.38 points or 1.03 per cent to 24823.12 the S&P 500 lost 25.3 points or 0.94 per cent to 2676.28 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 44.31 points or 0.62 per cent to 7092.08. Shares in Walmart Inc fell 1.8 per cent after the retailer’s earnings report. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.60 per cent falling for a sixth straight session. The dollar index which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies rose 0.33 per cent with the euro up 0.04 per cent to $1.1312. US retail sales rebounded sharply in October as purchases of motor vehicles and building materials surged likely driven by recovery efforts in areas devastated by Hurricane Florence. US Treasury prices rose sending yields to two-week lows across the curve as concerns about a weak stock market and Britain’s exit from the European Union prompted investors to seek the safety of government bonds. Benchmark US 10-year notes last rose 10/32 in price to yield 3.0848 per cent from 3.12 per cent late on Wednesday. Nerves among Britain government bond investors forced the country’s debt agency to accept low-ball bids for a 20-year bond at auction. Oil rose steadying after steep recent declines though concern about the prospect of an oversupplied market next year continued to weigh on prices despite Opec’s message that it may cut crude output. US crude rose 1.1 per cent to $56.87 per barrel and Brent was last at $67.04 up 1.39 per cent on the day. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Saying credit markets were tumultuous over the first five months of the year would be an understatement. 2016 began with a crude awakening of six to seven weeks of pure selloff and widening with the next three months or so of market recovery and spread tightening. Heading into June markets were grappling with conflicting economic data signals across all corners of the globe coupled with uncertainty about the timing of the next US Federal Reserve’s next move. More importantly an incessantly yo-yo-ing of predictions regarding the outcome of the infamous Brexit referendum vote dictated market sentiment and direction for most of the month. Following a sharp downward revision in housing data in the US it became increasing apparent that Federal Reserve chairperson Janet Yellen would stay put in June as far as rate hikes are concerned. Furthermore doubts around the Brexit vote and volatility in the markets in the run up to the referendum took off the sparkle from the positives which came out (and are expected to be reaped in the coming weeks) from the European Central Bank's corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) as UK-exposed credit and peripheral spreads came under pressures. The CSPP began on 8 June and credit spreads ground tighter with many market analysts expecting the ECB to anticipate and front-load its asset purchases in view of the imminent summer lull in trading activity. Uncertainty over the results of the UK referendum kept the markets on their toes and risk aversion spread quickly only to reverse in the days before the referendum. And then on 24 June markets woke up to mayhem panic last seen in September 2008 (with the Lehman Brothers collapse) as the British electorate voted out of the European Union. Clearly this was not the result the market was gearing for and was neither evidently not the most market-friendly outcomes as all risky assets sold off heavily with some percentage changes even reaching double digits on the day. The Benchmark 10-Year Benchmark Bund reaching intra-day historic lows of -0.175 per cent with high yield spreads across the globe sharply wider. Worth mentioning though that given the large swings emerging market credit came out relatively unscathed from all happenings in the developed world. This sharp widening in spreads particularly in high yield credit made valuations more attractive and created pockets of value as institutional investors sought to take advantage of beaten down prices helping spreads recover heading into the month’s close. We would tend to agree that there could be value but it would be too premature to estimate the extent of damage and ramifications of the 23 June referendum result particularly on a global scale. The economic damage could be in its infancy and this will only start to show up in statistical economic data in a couple of quarters' time. The biggest dilemma for investors would be how to tackle this transitory period as we could well be faced with a business as usual scenario till things really begin to start taking shape. In the short term we are of the opinion that credit could grind marginally tighter at best or trade sideways; the lower-for-longer interest rate environment should be supportive for that persistent search for yield that would render it highly improbable for investors to shun the asset class at this juncture.

Thus the UK’s decision to exit the Union has macroeconomic implications for Malta. The Central Bank of Malta in this light has just published a policy note that tries to estimate the short-to-medium-term economic impact of this development. Malta’s relative dependence on the UK market has fallen greatly over time with the share of export of goods to the UK dropping from 40 per cent in the early 1970s to about three per cent in recent years. Maltese exports of goods to the UK as a percentage of GDP amounted to nearly 10 per cent in the mid-1970s while in 2016 they stood at just 1.4 per cent. The fall in the relative share of UK tourists though less acute is also considerable from nearly 80 per cent in the early 1980s to less than 30 per cent currently. Expenditure by UK tourists now amounts to 4.9 per cent of GDP down from 9.4 per cent in 2001. Eurostat data suggests that services exports to the UK are equivalent to some 13 per cent of GDP though a considerable amount are financial services flows which tend to have nearly equivalent entries as imports of services. In fact Malta’s net exports of services to the UK amount to six per cent of GDP. The Maltese financial sector’s exposure to the UK is broadly in line with the two countries’ trade relationship. Malta’s reliance on UK workers has risen over time. About 1.8 per cent of all persons currently in employment in Malta are British citizens a proportion higher than the proportion of all foreign workers at the time of Malta’s accession to the EU. Besides this growth there has been a strong rise in the number of UK citizens who retire in Malta from 1930 in the 2005 census to 3537 in the 2011 census.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 At this stage there is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the terms under which the UK is likely to exit the EU. Such uncertainties include the position of current UK nationals working in the EU and EU nationals working in the UK. Despite this uncertainty formal assessments conducted by researchers and international institutions point at significant downward economic risks for the UK economy. The EU is an important partner for the UK attracting around half of UK exports. The EU exports a significant amount of goods and services to the UK implying some EU countries are likely to lose economically as a result of Brexit. Moreover given its size this development is projected to have global effects though more contained compared to the contractions in economic growth expec-ted in the EU and UK. The analysis does not consider the possible benefits for the Maltese economy should UK companies relocate to Malta The quantification of these effects depends on the outcome of the negotiation process between the UK and the EU. On balance the vast majority of studies published most notably those by the IMF and the UK government suggest a significant long-run deterioration in the UK’s GDP ranging from -1.3\\xa0 per cent to around -9.5 per cent. In this light the Central Bank of Malta’s macroeconometric model was used to study the possible impact on the Maltese economy of this decline in foreign demand. Two scenarios were applied. The first is the best-case alternative which assumes that the UK will adopt the so-called Norwegian model that would allow it to retain access to the single market. In return however the UK would need to accept the free movement of people as well as continue to pay contributions to EU countries. The main negative economic consequences in this case relate to a period of uncertainty surrounding negotiations as well as potential exit from the customs union. The second scenario is the worst case and assumes no agreement is reached. Under the WTO rules the UK and the EU would trade under fixed maximum tariffs. The UK would lose access to the single market but would be free to set its own rules concerning migration and would not contribute to the EU budget. These scenarios are constructed using predictions for the UK made by the Bank of England in February 2017 those for the EU published by the IMF in 2016 and those concerning the US and the rest of the world by Goldman Sachs in 2016. The results of the analysis suggest the peak effects on Malta’s baseline GDP will be -0.24 per cent under the benign scenario to -0.54 per cent under the worst-case scenario. As expected given the nature of the shocks under consideration the main contributor behind these falls at least in the first two years emanate from the external sector. Falls in aggregate demand also lead to a reduction in private consumption and investment. Given the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the UK’s exit from the EU these results should be treated with caution. They focus solely on the impact of the possible drop in foreign demand and the change in exchange rates. Furthermore the analysis does not take into consideration the possible benefits for the Maltese economy should UK companies relocate to Malta to retain access to the EU market. Finally over the next three years the Maltese economy is projected to grow by close to 12 per cent implying that even under the worst-case scenario Brexit will have a negligible impact on Malta’s pace of economic expansion.

A business seminar on ‘Brexit − A Financial Markets/FX Perspective’ held by the Malta Business Bureau and Bank of Valletta last week gave businesses insight on the latest developments in the Brexit debate and how it will affect their day-to-day operations. In his opening address Frank V. Farrugia president of the Malta Chamber of Commerce Enterprise and Industry highlighted the increased uncertainty over the UK’s departure from the EU. Farrugia said: “A no-deal Brexit seems to have become the only true option at this stage. The votes which Prime Minister Theresa May has announced and which will take place in the House of Commons this week may change this and give some more certainty on the chosen path forward. However given the circumstances it is now our duty to stand foursquare by our members and businesses to support them through these challenging times ahead.” Keynote speaker Christopher Dembik head of macroeconomic analysis at Saxo Bank remarked that while some economic sectors within the EU and some EU member states will be more exposed than others from a macroeconomic level Brexit is mostly a British problem with risk of contagion close to zero. He also explained that the probability of a delayed Brexit and a new referendum are high however he believes that the main worry is the lack of new credit growth which is the UK’s top issue for medium- and long-term macroeconomic output. Participating in the panel discussion moderated by Mark Scicluna Bartoli (executive EU & Institutional Affairs Bank of Valletta) were panellists Simon De Cesare (president of the Malta Business Bureau) Stefano Mallia (president of the Brexit Advisory Group within the European Economic and Social Committee) Glenn Micallef (head of EU Secretariat within the Ministry for European Affairs). Dembik discussed this week’s votes in the House of Commons and how a delay of a hard Brexit may provide a breather but that postponing without solutions in place will not address business needs. Other topics discussed by the panel included how to manage the high volatility in the FX market and how the fluctuations of the value of the sterling to the euro are affecting business including tourism operators. Reference was also made to the aviation agreement which was concluded recently at an EU level to ensure continuity of air travel between the UK and the EU. Concluding the event Tony Zahra president of the Malta Hotels and Restaurant Association further emphasised the very uncertain nature of Brexit which makes it hard to talk about and harder to prepare for. Zahra remarked that March 29 is only a few days away and he certainly hopes that a deal is reached before then for the consequences of a no-deal Brexit would be too disastrous. MBB CEO Joe Tanti who chaired the event encouraged the EU institutions to assist businesses address the current uncertainty due to Brexit and urged member states to uphold the integrity of the single market in spite of the populist political climate. The Malta Business Bureau is the EU-business advisory office of the Malta Chamber of Commerce Enterprise and Industry and the Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Oil prices slipped yesterday as market participants absorbed the shock of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union though some analysts said Brexit would have a limited impact on global fuel demand. Brent crude futures were down 35 cents at $48.06 a barrel by 1123 GMT. US crude was down 42 cents at $47.22 a barrel. Both crude benchmarks slumped about five per cent on Friday amid plunging global financial markets after the British referendum results gave an unexpected 52 per cent to 48 per cent victory to the campaign to take Britain out of the EU. Oil prices rose slightly early yesterday as analysts said Britain’s EU exit would have very little impact on physical oil trading – before slipping back later. “If we assume a two per cent drop in UK GDP in response to the exit vote which is on the high end of our economists’ estimates then UK oil demand would likely be reduced by one per cent or 16000 barrels per day which is a 0.016 per cent hit to global demand. This is extremely small on any measure” said Goldman Sachs. International Energy Agency chief Fatih Birol also downplayed the impact of Brexit on global oil demand. “Since a big chunk of oil demand is from emerging countries namely Asia I don’t see a major impact [of Brexit] on oil demand” he told Reuters. PVM’s Tamas Varga said given Brexit’s limited impact on global oil demand in the foreseeable future a tightening in the oil market remained on the cards in the second half of the year. “If one subscribes to this view then it is not difficult to conclude that the Brexit-triggered oil price sell-off should not last and the downside is limited” he said. Morgan Stanley said in a note that the larger political and policy repercussions of a Brexit could not be ignored. “Europe is a big trading partner for the United States and China which could lead to knock on global effects and a stronger dollar is generally unhelpful for demand” Morgan Stanley said. “In a high stress case our economists see global gross domestic product slowing to 2.7 per cent in 2017 – nearly a global recession.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Sterling rallied yesterday on fresh hope that British Prime Minister Theresa May would avoid a chaotic no-deal Brexit while global stock markets recovered. The pound jumped as high as $1.3262 in early deals before tempering the gains by the afternoon. The European single currency fell as low as 85.25 pence on hopes of an orderly departure from the European Union on April 12. The long-running saga took a fresh twist after Brexit hardliner Jacob Rees-Mogg declared on Twitter: “The choice seems to be Mrs May’s deal or no Brexit”. Mr Rees-Mogg head of the European Research Group of eurosceptic lawmakers and an MP for Ms May’s Conservatives also said in a political podcast interview that “the PM will not deliver a no-deal Brexit.” Oanda analyst Craig Erlam said it had been clear for months that “May’s strategy has been to\\xa0\\xa0corner sceptics into backing\\xa0\\xa0her deal”.\\xa0 “The idea that the risk of no deal or no Brexit would be enough to win enough votes may be starting to bear fruit just as parliament seeks to wrest control of the process” he told AFP. “Securing the backing of a high profile ERG member like Rees-Mogg albeit reluctantly could dramatically improve May’s numbers. It’s now just a question of whether it’s too little too late.” The remarks came one day after Britain’s Parliament seized the initiative from Ms May in a historic vote to give members of Parliament a broader say on what happens next. “Jacob Rees-Mogg appeared to be responsible for the pound perking up” said Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell. Monday’s vote creates parliamentary time for MPs to come up with their own Brexit proposals as Britain tries to stave off a messy divorce in two weeks. They will now choose whether to revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit hold another referendum vote for a deal including a Customs union and single market membership or leave the EU without a deal. However even if they decide a majority course of action the government is not legally bound to follow their instructions. Meanwhile global stocks rebounded after the previous day’s losses in many markets though dealers nevertheless trod cautiously still reeling from Monday’s pummelling which came on the back of a drop in benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields below those for three-month bills for the first time since before the global financial crisis. This so-called inverted yield curve shows investors are more willing to buy long-term debt usually viewed as a higher risk as they consider the short-term outlook more hazardous.

I think that the British people made a big mistake.” Charles Fenech 52 Safi team leader Emergency Department  “Personally I think that this is the right decision.

After EU leaders approved a reset of the Brexit timetable on Thursday Britain is left with four possible courses ahead of an all-important parliamentary vote on the divorce deal next week. Here is how the Brexit endgame could play out: Leave with deal on May 22 British MPs have twice rejected by overwhelming margins a draft divorce agreement struck between London and Brussels in November last year. A new vote on the agreement which allows for a long transition period that will give time for trade ties to be negotiated is expected next week. If MPs overcome numerous objections from \"Brexiteers\" and \"Remainers\" and approve the deal Britain will leave the European Union on May 22. In EU talks in Brussels on Thursday French President Emmanuel Macron estimated the probability of MPs approving the deal at just five percent according to a European source. According to some reports May could try to get her deal over the line by offering to resign if MPs approve it which could win over some Brexit hardliners. This would trigger a Conservative Party leadership contest whose winner would be the new prime minister. No-deal Brexit April 12 or later If MPs reject the deal for a third time the default option would be that Britain leaves without a deal. According to a European official that hard deadline would be midnight Brussels time on April 12 but Macron said this was not \"necessarily\" the case and a later date for no-deal Brexit could be agreed. May has not ruled out the possibility of a no-deal. Some commentators say her position has hardened in recent days and she could be prepared to go through with it despite a potentially heavy economic fallout. Request long Brexit delay Britain could also ask EU leaders for another much longer delay that would mean it would have to hold European Parliament elections at the end of May. The European Commission the EU\\'s executive arm has advised EU leaders that this longer extension should be at least until the end of 2019 and possibly much longer to allow for a proper change in Brexit strategy. The longer delay would allow time for a change in prime minister if the growing list of May opponents in the Conservative Party manage to force her out. It would also open up other options such as holding a general election or perhaps a second referendum. Britain\\'s Electoral Commission has budgeted for European elections and could hold them at short notice but May has said it would be \"unacceptable\". \"I don\\'t believe it\\'s right to be in a situation of holding European parliamentary elections three years on from people having voted to leave the EU\" she said. Stop Brexit This is by far the least likely option but is still one of the possibilities mentioned by EU President Donald Tusk in his remarks after Thursday\\'s summit. An online petition started in Britain on Wednesday asking for the government to do this has garnered more than 2.5 million signatures so far. The European Court of Justice has ruled that Britain could unilaterally revoke its Article 50 notification - the formal procedure for leaving the EU. House of Lords member John Kerr who helped draw up Article 50 said a revocation \"isn\\'t politically doable\" without a general election or referendum. May has also ruled this option out telling reporters: \"I do not believe we should be revoking Article 50\". \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

But in the referendum it voted to remain in the EU; it had benefited greatly from EU subsidies (paid for by the UK). No doubt it expected to remain in the EU as part of the UK; after all it had been assured that the Remain camp would win. But it lost. Which leaves the province in something of a quandary.

Britain could borrow nearly £65 billion more than planned in the next couple of years as new Chancellor Philip Hammond seeks to ‘reset’ government budget policy to ease the shock of last month’s vote to leave the European Union. Ratings agencies and economists widely expect borrowing to rise materially next year for the first time since 2010 as Hammond has to call time – temporarily – on the austerity which dominated his predecessor George Osborne’s six years in office. After taking office two weeks ago Hammond said the darker post-Brexit outlook meant policies the Conservative government had pursued since 2010 needed to change – and economists are now starting to put numbers on what this might mean. Hammond told reporters on Sunday the scale of any stimulus would hinge on how rapidly the economy was slowing by the time of the Autumn Statement the half-yearly budget update that usually comes in late November or early December. “There is going to need to be a rethink” said Paul Johnson director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies a non-partisan think-tank which scrutinises the public finances. Just sticking with the plans Osborne set out in March means borrowing is likely to overshoot its target by tens of billions of pounds as tax revenues fall and spending on social security for the low-paid and unemployed rises Johnson said. Several economists – working partly off rules of thumb from Britain’s budget watchdog – estimate on average that borrowing this tax year and next combined will be almost £65 billion above forecast even if the economy dodges recession. They did not forecast further out because of uncertainty over the economy and the government’s budget plans. Total public borrowing in 2015/16 was £75 billion – a hefty four per cent of GDP. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecast in March it would drop to £55.5 billion this year and £38.8 billion in 2017/2018. By contrast Sam Hill an economist at the Royal Bank of Canada expects weaker growth alone will stop borrowing falling this year and see it rise to £85 billion next year double March’s forecast. Hammond has said the Bank of England will be the first public body to offer stimulus if needed possibly as soon as its meeting next week. But there will be greater pressure than before on the finance ministry to act too. Unlike when Britain last entered recession in 2008 interest rates and government bond yields are already at a record low limiting the BoE’s scope to boost growth through rate cuts or through quantitative easing. If Hammond does offer more stimulus he will have to choose how to spend it. Long-term public investment offers the biggest boost per pound spent according to the OBR giving three times the return of tax cuts and 50 per cent more than general public spending. Its main downside is that effective projects take more time than tax cuts or public-sector pay rises which immediately put more money in Britons’ pockets. But Johnson and Hill say the case for investment is stronger than in a normal short-lived downturn as uncertainty about Britain’s EU relations could weigh on the economy for years due to the likely length of exit negotiations. Public investment has also been squeezed dropping to £34 billion last year from £51 billion in 2009/2010. In March the government listed £425 billion of investment projects which needed private involvement ranging from offshore wind farms to high-speed rail links. If a more immediate boost was needed tax measures which rewarded business investment would be a better option than repeating 2009’s temporary cut in value-added tax as business spending appears weaker than consumer sentiment. Markets were unlikely to baulk at funding a large British budget deficit at a time when even record-low gilt yields were much higher than those for Japanese and German debt he added. Higher borrowing however could only be a temporary solution until the longer-run impact of leaving the EU became clear the IFS’s Johnson said. “If you borrow more now you have to pay it back in the end. That will inevitably extend austerity – but with a break in the middle” he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Indications show Malta should not face any adverse effects on British investment service pensions and VAT on food and medicines because of Brexit the deputy prime minister said. However one still needed to evaluate the effects on exports tourism and Maltese workers and students in the UK. “This depends much on the negotiations between the EU and the UK” Louis Grech said. The minister reaffirmed that the government was already working a plan to mitigate the negative effects even if the conditions leading to the UK's exit from the EU were still not known.\\xa0 Winding up the debate on his ministerial votes in parliament Mr Grech said local banks were not expected to be exposed to risks or liquidity problems. He said he had set up a Brexit Unit within his office and with other ministries to examine the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats of the British decision to pull out of the EU. On the positive side there could be opportunities in financial asset management the gaming industry and financial services. However Brexit might have an impact on the multi-financial framework including European funds he said. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker agreed over dinner in Brussels last night that the pace of negotiations over Britain\\'s departure from the European Union should be stepped up.\\xa0\\xa0 A short joint statement described the Brussels get-together as \"constructive and friendly\" saying the pair agreed Brexit efforts should \"accelerate over the months to come\". May\\'s visit was announced less than 24 hours before they sat down. They were accompanied by their chief Brexit negotiators David Davis and Michel Barnier. No information was given to press besides the six-sentence communique. The statement made no judgement over who was to blame for the deadlock in the talks. The EU blames May for failing to detail how much she is willing to pay to settle divorce obligations May blames the EU for refusing to talk about a future trade deal and transition until the money is settled. Some EU voices are not happy at the meeting - expressing concern that May is trying to divide the other 27 member states. Businesses in the UK are worried too. warning that without clarity on what happens after Brexit they may start switching investments early next year. Each side now hoping the other really is as committed to speeding up negotiations as they say there are - as the time ticks down to Britain\\'s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May outlined her Brexit survival strategy to her disgruntled ministers Monday as Britain entered the week it was meant to leave the European Union with its government in crisis. Britain is still no closer to figuring out how it intends to split off from the other 27 EU nations than it was when voters narrowly backed Brexit in a divisive 2016 national poll. All the options are back on the table after May\\'s deal twice failed to win parliamentary support by resounding margins. Anxious EU leaders agreed last week to delay Brexit\\'s March 29 deadline and give Britain until April 12 to figure out how it intends to avoid simply crashing out of the bloc. The EU ramped up the pressure on Monday saying it had completed no-deal preparations as this outcome on April 12 was looking \"increasingly likely\". May outlined her plans to top ministers Monday before chairing a special meeting of the Cabinet that followed a weekend of UK media reports about an attempted government coup. \"Time\\'s up Theresa\" The Sun tabloid Britain\\'s most widely read newspaper declared in a front-page headline Monday. May huddled on Sunday with several of the reported plotters at her Chequers country residence. Most of them are Brexit backers who fear the terms of Britain\\'s departure being watered down - or even reversed - down the line. \"Theresa May is the chicken who bottled Brexit\" former foreign minister Boris Johnson - May\\'s great critic and eternal leadership rival - wrote in a weekly column for The Telegraph. \"It is time for the PM to channel the spirit of Moses in Exodus and say to Pharaoh in Brussels – LET MY PEOPLE GO.\" \\'Disastrous position\\' How May intends to go about saving both Brexit and her leadership should become more apparent when she speaks in parliament Monday afternoon. Media reports said she will offer lawmakers to vote on an array of Brexit options that include Britain maintaining much closer trade ties with the European Union than those written into her deal. Other alternatives include holding a second Brexit referendum and even revoking Article 50 - the notice London sent Brussels about its intention to leave. \"I think we will see today that there is a mood in the House of Commons to stop us leaving without a deal even if that means no Brexit\" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told BBC radio. \"I think that is a constitutionally disastrous position.\" The prospect of a softer form of Brexit could theoretically push Brexit hardliners into supporting May\\'s current deal. But May herself admits that she is nowhere near to securing the votes needed to finally get her Brexit deal over the line. It is not entirely clear when - or even if - she will go for a third vote. \"As the prime minister has said there wouldn\\'t be much point bringing a vote back to the house that clearly we were going to lose\" Fox said Monday. What happens to her premiership if parliament rallies around a more EU-friendly Brexit alternative that contradicts her policies is unclear. Parliamentary control Brexit should happen on May 22 if the premier\\'s deal somehow prevails. But parliament could still get a chance to have its say on alternative options on Wednesday if an initial vote by MPs later on Monday goes through. Whatever lawmakers decide on would not be binding - but it would put enormous pressure on May. Parliament is most likely to rally around the idea of keeping Britain in a customs union with the European Union or its single market. Both of those policies contradict May\\'s position. A customs union would keep Britain from striking its own trade agreements with non-EU countries. A single market would require the government to go back on May\\'s promise to regain control of Britain\\'s borders and migration policy. But some of May\\'s most senior minister said they would support any options that ensures Britain leaves the EU with a deal.

Photo: Phil Noble/Reuters  A British exit from the European Union would have negative effects on Malta a new report has found. A comprehensive review of the implications of a Brexit published yesterday by ratings agency Fitch listed Malta as one of the “most exposed” countries to a negative fallout from the move. Ireland Belgium the Netherlands Cyprus and Luxembourg were also listed as vulnerable because like Malta they have strong export ties to the UK. Fitch found that the Brexit-sensitive countries all exported goods and services at a rate of at least eight per cent of their economy to the British economy. It would reduce the UK’s contribution to the EU budget a net €7.1 billion in 2014 “The economic impact of Brexit would be lower for the EU than for the UK but would still be palpable” the report said. Malta along with Belgium and Germany was also listed as having “significant investment and financial assets in the UK” which could suffer losses due to currency valuations. This meant the value of those assets in euros would dip if there were a permanent depreciation of the sterling. The report also noted that Malta’s banking sector along with those of Ireland Luxembourg Spain France and Germany had “significant links” to that of the UK. Giving a more general overview the Fitch report said that a Brexit would weigh on the economies of other member countries and increase political risks in Europe. This could ultimately effect Malta’s own credit standings it added. “We would not expect to take any immediate negative rating actions on other EU sovereigns if the UK left. But negative actions would become more likely in the medium term if the economic impact were severe or significant political risks materialised” the report warned. In a more immediate sense the report said that a Brexit would reduce the UK’s contribution to the EU budget a net €7.1 billion in 2014 after rebates potentially to zero. This would imply that other net contributors would have to increase payments to the EU or net recipients accept lower EU expenditure. A Brexit would create a precedent for countries leaving the EU the report also warned. Fitch said that this could boost anti-EU or other populist political parties and make EU leaders more reluctant to implement unpopular policies with long-term economic benefits. Meanwhile negotiating the terms of the UK’s exit could exhaust the EU’s time and energy potentially slowing down progress in other priority areas. And if the UK were to thrive outside of the EU it might encourage other countries to follow suit the report warned. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

On Monday which represented a bottom in most equity markets the index fell a further 2.6 percent. Up to Tuesday this week the index is 3.3 percent higher than pre-Brexit levels. This remarkable performance by the FTSE 100 relates to the fact that the Index has a high allocation to the commodity sector. This sector has performed very well as commodity prices remained relatively stable while the US dollar which is the currency in which commodities trade strengthened. German Dax Over the two trading days that followed the Brexit vote the German equity index lost 9.6 percent. German exporters were hit hard on a perceived deterioration of trade flows in the region. German Banks also fared badly. The Dax is currently trading 7 percent below pre-Brexit levels. French CAC 40 The French index touched a bottom on the 27th of June. Over the two trading days the index fell 10.7 percent. Up to the time of writing the French equity index was 9.1 percent below pre-Brexit levels. French banks were badly hit following the referendum in the UK. Societe General has fallen 27 percent since BNP Paribas fell by 19 percent. Exposure by these Banks to peripheral countries is partly to blame. Italian MIB In Italy Brexit was followed shortly afterwards by a banking crisis. Debate is currently ongoing on how to handle excessive levels of non-performing loans held by Italian Banks. Brexit and Financial shares have dragged down the Italian index by over 14 percent. Other European Indices have followed similar trends with the European Benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 Index plunging 9.2 percent since.

Global capital markets reeled yesterday after Britain voted to leave the European Union with $2 trillion in value wiped from equity bourses worldwide while money poured into safe-haven gold and government bonds. Sterling suffered a record plunge to a 31-year low. The blow to investor confidence and the uncertainty the vote has sparked could keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates as planned this year and even spark a new round of emergency policy easing from major central banks. The move blindsided investors who had expected Britain to vote to stay in the EU and sparked sharp repricing across asset classes. Mainland European equity markets took the brunt of selling as investors feared the vote could destabilise the 28-member bloc by prompting more referendums. The traditional safe-harbour assets of top-rated government debt the Japanese yen and gold all jumped. Spot gold rose nearly five per cent and the yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note fell to lows last seen in 2012 at 1.5445 per cent. Stocks tumbled in Europe. Frankfurt and Paris each fell six per cent to eight per cent. Italian and Spanish markets and European bank stocks overall were headed for their sharpest one-day drops ever. London’s FTSE however dropped 2.3 per cent with some investors speculating that the plunge in sterling could benefit Britain’s economy. Britain’s big banks took a $100 billion battering with Lloyds Barclays and RBS plunging as much as 30 per cent though they cut those losses in half later in the day. Stocks on Wall Street opened more than two per cent lower with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping as much as 538 points. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 463.63 points or 2.57 per cent at 17547.44 the S&P 500 lost 57.03 points or 2.7 per cent at 2056.29 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 153.38 points or 3.12 per cent at 4756.67. MSCI’s all-country world stock index fell 3.8 per cent. The British pound dived by 18 US cents at one point easily the biggest fall in living memory to its lowest since 1985. The euro slid three per cent to $1.1050 as investors feared for its very future. Sterling was last down 7.6 per cent at $1.3751 having carved out a range of $1.3228 to $1.5022. The fall was even larger than during the global financial crisis and the currency was moving two or three cents in the blink of an eye. The Bank of England European Central Bank and the People’s Bank of China all said they were ready to provide liquidity if needed to ensure global market stability. Europe’s safety play the 10-year German government bond surged with yields tumbling back into negative territory and a new record low. Oil prices slumped by more than four per cent amid fears of a broader economic slowdown that could reduce demand. US crude shed $2.02 to $48.09 a barrel while Brent fell 4.3 per cent to $48.70 before. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The Malta Business Bureau (MBB) has welcomed the EU decision to endorse the Brexit agreement negotiated between the European Commission and the UK government. EU-27 leaders formally agreed a Brexit deal at a Brussels summit on Sunday urging Britons to back Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s package which faces furious opposition in the British parliament. The agreement comes just months ahead of the UK\\'s withdrawal from the EU\\xa0on March 29.\\xa0 In a statement on Monday\\xa0MBB President Simon De Cesare said: \"The endorsement by the EU member states confirms that in spite of the UK’s decision to leave the EU being regrettable and that the outcome will have negative repercussions for both sides the EU is committed to an orderly end of the current relationship and is committed to negotiate a future economic and security partnership while preserving the integrity of the European Single Market.\"Politicians need to put radical ideologies aside. No circumstances justify a no-deal Brexit. He added that the agreement paved the way for a transition period that preserved the status quo at least until the end of 2020 and allowed businesses a smoother transition and more time for preparation.\\xa0Despite the positive outcome of Sunday’s decision however the bureau said it was still very concerned about the political uncertainty in Britain and over whether the deal would be approved by the UK Parliament. \"Politicians need to put radical ideologies aside and be more sensible to the facts and the implications on the economy businesses as well as the impact on citizens. No circumstance justify a no-deal Brexit\" Mr De Cesare said.The MBB invited business operators and professionals with interests in the UK market to be informed and prepared for any eventuality that the departure of the UK will unavoidably bring to avoid any disruption that could potentially come into effect as soon as four months from now. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  After six months as British High Commissioner to Malta the advice I was given by my friends and colleagues about Malta has been proved right. Britain and Malta are about as close to each other as is possible without actually having a land border. Brits live in Malta; Maltese live in Britain; half a million Brits come here for their holidays; our histories are littered with each other’s stories; we speak the same language; we have the same outlook on business; and we both tend to see the world through the same prism of openness and liberal values. To cap it all my (Maltese) driver supports the same Premier League team as I do (Manchester United if you are interested). It’s a familiar story I don’t need to labour. Last year among my pre-posting briefing papers and background documents my reading list included history books in which I found the many extraordinary stories that paint the picture of Malta. It’s almost too much to absorb. Malta’s history is rich heroic and long and for at least the last two centuries Britain has been an integral part of it. We see many signs of this heritage not least this year’s 75th anniversary of the award of the George Cross to Malta a clear reminder of something very special in the lives of our two nations. But what about this Brexit thing? Doesn’t that rather blur the rose-tinted view I have described? Well no absolutely not. We may be leaving the EU but we are not leaving Europe and we are not leaving our friends. Britain will be forging a new partnership with the EU and new partnerships with each of the 27 members of the EU. For all the familiar reasons the UK-Malta relationship has a head start. We already have a brilliant relationship and no one wants that to stop. While plenty of people have talked to me in my first six months about their sadness at our leaving no one is suggesting that this will damage our relationship. Indeed as we have all moved on from the drama of June 23 the conversations now are about what we are doing to make this work – both for the UK and for Malta. It’s a positive vision. The UK’s Prime Minister Theresa May set this out very clearly in her Lancaster House speech. Its essence bears repeating. The British people made a democratic decision to leave the EU. They wanted Britain to be an independent sovereign nation making its own laws and not subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. That’s what leaving the EU means. It means that we won’t be members of the club any longer; we won’t be in the Single Market and we won’t be in the Customs Union. Britain will be free to make its own trade agreements including with the EU and to forge partnerships on any manner of policy. We may be leaving the EU but we are not leaving Europe June 23 was not the moment Britain chose to step back from the world. It was the moment we chose to build a truly Global Britain – the best friend and neighbour to our European partners and a country that reaches beyond the borders of Europe. On February 2 the UK Government published its plan for ‘a new positive and constructive’ partnership in the mutual interest of the UK and the EU with a White Paper presented to Parliament. The document mirrors the 12 principles set out by the Prime Minister in her speech at Lancaster House presenting a clear and comprehensive vision for Britain both now and after we leave the EU. While Britain wants to remain a good friend and neighbour to Europe we know there are some voices calling for a punitive deal. What nonsense. As David Jones MP Minister of State at the Department for Exiting the European Union said in Malta a few weeks ago: “Friends do not punish friends”. We will follow a better path because of the shared values and spirit of goodwill that exists on both sides; because it is the economically rational thing for both Britain and the EU; and because co-operation is needed not just when it comes to trade but for security too. The European Union will remain a close and valuable partner on all the challenges facing Europe and the world be they migration terrorism Syria or Libya. The UK government will continue to defend human rights and support political and economic freedom working closely with Malta and other allies in the interests of peace and stability for the Mediterranean and North African region. Furthermore as we leave the EU the message we take to the world is this: Britain remains open for business. We are the same outward-looking globally-minded flexible and dynamic country we have always been. This government has a clear vision for Britain. We want the UK to become a hub of global commerce; the world’s natural business partner. As British High Commissioner to Malta I will work to ensure not only that the UK-Malta relationship remains as strong as it is today but that it becomes deeper and better still. Sure we will no longer be sitting (literally) next to each other in the EU meeting rooms but as British High Commissioner to Malta I am convinced that this is a relationship which will not diminish with the passage of time – or with the UK leaving the EU. Rather the links between our two peoples will continue to be refreshed updated and strengthened. I propose to work with the Maltese government and the Maltese community to ensure this happens. If my first six months have been an affirmation of the closeness of the UK-Malta relationship the next six months will be the beginning of a new stage in our fabulous shared history. I can’t pretend it will be straightforward but I am looking forward to it. And who knows Manchester United might make it into the Champions League.

British Prime Minister Theresa May appointed Dominic Raab as the new Brexit Secretary on Monday after his predecessor quit in protest at the government\\'s plans for a close trading relationship with the European Union. \"The Queen has been pleased to approve the appointment of Dominic Raab MP as Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union\" a statement from May\\'s office said. Raab was previously a minister for housing. The man previously responsible for the UK\\'s Brexit\\xa0negotiations with the UK\\xa0David Davis said he had resigned to stop May from handing too much power to the European Union increasing the pressure on a British leader struggling to overcome Brexit divisions. Davis who campaigned for Brexit in Britain\\'s 2016 referendum told BBC radio that a hard-won agreement with her cabinet team of ministers had given \"too much away too easily\" to EU negotiators who he feared would simply ask for more. His late-night resignation was a blow to May who was momentarily buoyed on Friday after seemingly thrashing out a deal to keep the closest possible trading ties with her cabinet to support her plans to leave the EU. It raises questions over whether she can sell her plan to Britain\\'s equally divided parliament and may embolden those wanting to unseat her. The resignation may also further complicate an already fraught Brexit with less than nine months before Britain leaves and just over three before the EU says it wants a deal that will mark Britain\\'s biggest foreign and trade policy shift in decades. But the pound rose with traders saying the compromise plan made a \"soft Brexit\" more likely. \"My fear is they will take what we have offered already and then demand some more. That has been their practice throughout the last year and I fear in fact if anything this is just the start\" Davis said. \"It seems to me we are giving too much away too easily and that is a dangerous strategy at this time.\" It seems to me we are giving too much away too easily and that is a dangerous strategy at this time- David Davis Denying that he wanted to unseat the prime minister he said he would now \"argue for being as firm as possible.\" \"Perhaps one side effect of my departure might be to put a little pressure on the government not to make any other concessions and I will keep arguing to say there is a better way to do it than this.\" In a letter sent to May in the early hours of Monday Davis said he was not willing to be \"a reluctant conscript\" to her negotiating stance which would see Britain mirror EU rules and regulations. May replied to his letter to say she did not agree \"with your characterisation of the policy we agreed at cabinet on Friday\". She thanked him for his work. In a move that could fire up eurosceptics in May\\'s Conservative Party a government source said that Steve Baker a minister who worked for Davis had also resigned. For many Brexit campaigners Baker\\'s role in government gave them faith in the process.\\xa0 PEACE DEAL? After the hours-long meeting at Chequers May seemed to have persuaded the most vocal Brexit campaigners in the cabinet including Davis to back her plan to press for \"a free trade area for goods\" with the EU and maintain close trade ties. It won the backing of one other high-profile Brexit campaigner. Michael Gove May\\'s environment minister said on Sunday that while the agreed negotiating stance was not perfect he believed it delivered on handing back control to Britain. The so-called peace deal raised hopes that Britain could finally move on with all-but-stalled talks with the EU which has yet to give a definitive comment on whether they will accept May\\'s plan. But Davis had expressed his unease over a compromise plan right up until the eve of the meeting writing a letter to May describing her proposal to ease trade and give Britain more freedom to set tariffs as \"unworkable\". Davis has form on resigning if he disagrees with his party. In 2008 when the Conservatives were not in government Davis quit as a member of parliament to raise the profile of a debate over what saw as the erosion of civil liberties. Shortly afterwards he stood as the Conservative candidate and was re-elected. Other Brexit-supporting Conservative lawmakers have criticised the Chequers \"peace deal\" saying that May\\'s plans offered a Brexit in name only a betrayal of what they saw as her promise for a clean break with the EU. Their complaints raise a question mark over whether May can win backing in parliament for her plans if any deal with the EU is agreed later this year and some suggest several of them could try to trigger a leadership contest against her. Jacob Rees-Mogg the leader of a group of Brexit supporters in the Conservative Party said Davis\\' resignation proved that their concerns were well-founded and signalled that he would not vote for May\\'s plan if it came to a vote in parliament. \"It is crucially important as it shows how well founded concerns over the Chequers conclusions are\" he told Reuters. \"If the Brexit Secretary could not support them they cannot genuinely be delivering Brexit.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Updated 11.30am with reactions British Prime Minister Theresa May must give parliament a vote before she can formally start Britain\\'s exit from the European Union the UK Supreme Court ruled giving lawmakers who oppose her Brexit plans a chance to amend or hinder them. By a majority of eight to three the Supreme Court decided May could not use executive powers known as \"royal prerogative\" to invoke Article 50 of the EU\\'s Lisbon Treaty and begin two years of divorce talks. \"The Supreme Court today rules that the government cannot trigger Article 50 without an act of parliament authorising it to do so\" said Supreme Court President David Neuberger. However the judges did remove one major potential obstacle saying May did not need the approval of the UK\\'s devolved assemblies in Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland before triggering Brexit. May has said she intends to invoke Article 50 before the end of March but the ruling means she must bring legislation before parliament before she can go ahead. That opens up the Brexit process to scrutiny from lawmakers the majority of whom had wanted to stay in the EU. However the main opposition Labour Party said it would not block Brexit although it would try to amend the legislation. Labour Party said it would not block Brexit although it would try to amend the legislation \"Labour will seek to build in the principles of full tariff-free access to the single market and maintenance of workers\\' rights and social and environmental protections\" said party leader Jeremy Corbyn. Attorney General Jeremy Wright the government\\'s top lawyer who argued its case said ministers would implement the court\\'s ruling. \"Of course the government is disappointed with the outcome\" Wright said outside the Supreme Court. \"The government will comply with the judgment of the court and do all that is necessary to implement it.\"  May said the decision did nothing to change the path of Brexit. \"The British people voted to leave the EU and the government will deliver on their verdict - triggering Article 50 as planned by the end of March\" her spokesman said. Last week May set out her stall for negotiations promising a clean break with the world\\'s largest trading bloc as part of a 12-point plan to focus on global free trade deals setting a course for a so-called \"hard Brexit\". Some investors and those who backed the \"remain\" campaign hope that lawmakers most of whom wanted to stay in the EU will force May to seek a deal which prioritises access to the European single market of 500 million people or potentially even block Brexit altogether. Sterling initially rose on the news that the government had lost its appeal but it then fell over half a cent to hit day\\'s lows against the dollar and euro after the ruling that the devolved assemblies did not need to give their assent. By 1022 GMT it had trimmed some of those losses and stood at $1.2485 down 0.4 percent on the day. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Theresa May has put Britain on track for a \"hard Brexit\" by the spring of 2019 as she insisted she will not accept any limits on the UK\\'s ability to control its own borders. The Prime Minister\\'s declaration that the UK will \"make our own decisions\" on immigration put her on collision course with the Brussels institutions and the 27 remaining member states ahead of two-year withdrawal talks due to be triggered by the end of March 2017. European Council President Donald Tusk said other EU states would act to safeguard their own interests while Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat - who will be president of the Council when Mrs May kicks off talks by invoking Article 50 of the EU treaties - said the single market\\'s four freedoms of goods services capital and people \"cannot be decoupled\". Taking the unusual step for a Tory leader of addressing the annual Conservative conference on its opening day Mrs May confirmed plans for a Great Repeal Bill to overturn the 1972 Act which took the UK into what was then the European Economic Community. She said Article 50 would be invoked \"soon\" and no later than the end of March next year. And she rejected the argument Britain must choose between \"hard Brexit\" - in which the nation regains control over immigration but loses full access to the European single market - and \"soft Brexit\" under which access to the single market comes with a requirement to allow free movement of EU workers. To loud applause Mrs May said: \"I know some people ask about the \\'trade-off\\' between controlling immigration and trading with Europe. But that is the wrong way of looking at things. \"We have voted to leave the European Union and become a fully independent sovereign country. We will do what independent sovereign countries do. We will decide for ourselves how we control immigration. And we will be free to pass our own laws.\" We have voted to leave the European Union and become a fully independent sovereign country. We will do what independent sovereign countries do. We will decide for ourselves how we control immigration. And we will be free to pass our own laws. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron branded Mrs May\\'s announcement a \"disaster\" that would mean \"no single market for Britain\". But Mrs May insisted she would strike a deal allowing \"free trade in goods and services\" and giving British companies \"the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market and let European businesses do the same here\". And Brexit Secretary David Davis said EU leaders should \"think carefully\" before erecting barriers to trade. Describing talk of Britain being subjected to trade barriers such as tariffs as \"bluster\" Mr Davis said: \"It certainly won\\'t be to anyone\\'s benefit to see an increase in barriers to trade in either direction. \"So we want to maintain the freest possible trade between us without betraying the instruction we have received from the British people to take back control of our own affairs.\" CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said business needed \"urgent answers\" on barrier-free access to EU markets. She said: \"Businesses cannot continue to operate in the dark. The decisions they face today are real and pressing. \"The Government\\'s desire to play its negotiating cards close to its chest must be tempered by clear indications on how we will trade with the UK\\'s most important partner and how firms will be able to employ the people needed to drive growth.\" Mrs May said there would be \"no unnecessary delays\" to Brexit talks but added she would not give a \"running commentary\" on their progress. The Great Repeal Bill will transpose EU laws applying to the UK into the domestic statute book at the moment of withdrawal so they can subsequently be amended or abolished by the UK Parliament as required she said. She dismissed the argument that the outcome of negotiations should be subject to a second public vote and said: \"Come on. The referendum vote was clear it was legitimate it was the biggest vote for change this country has ever known. Brexit means Brexit and we are going to make a success of it.\" Attorney General Jeremy Wright will next week go to court to fight legal moves to secure a parliamentary vote on invoking Article 50 which was no more than an attempt to delay Brexit she said. And she insisted that while she will \"consult and work\" with devolved administrations in Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland it would be for the UK Government alone to negotiate a deal and there will be \"no opt-out from Brexit\" for any of the four nations of the UK. Mrs May said Brexit would not cut the UK off from the rest of the world but would transform it into \"global Britain a country with the self-confidence and the freedom to look beyond the continent of Europe and to the economic and diplomatic opportunities of the wider world\". There is already \"abundant evidence\" that foreign countries and multi-national businesses are interested in trade and investment opportunities with a post-Brexit UK said the Prime Minister. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said \" any lingering gloomadon-poppers\" should now accept Brexit will liberate the UK \" to be more active on the world stage than ever before\". Mrs May said she expected a post-Brexit Britain to co-operate with the remaining EU on law enforcement and counter-terrorism work while Mr Johnson said the UK would remain committed to inter-governmental work on issues such as sanctions on Russia and the Mediterranean migration crisis. \"A truly Global Britain is possible and it is in sight\" said Mrs May. \"Let\\'s ignore the pessimists let\\'s have the confidence in ourselves to go out into the world securing trade deals winning contracts generating wealth and creating jobs.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Updated 11.40am British MPs must decide on Tuesday whether to back Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit deal in a vote that could clear the way for Britain to leave the EU on March 29. As the scheduled departure date loomed nearly three years after Britons voted to leave May wrung last-minute changes to the deal from the EU in a trip to Strasbourg on Monday evening. On Tuesday her allies were weighing up whether or not the changes were enough to bring them onside. They include Brexit supporters in her Conservative Party and their allies in Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - both of whom rejected the deal in January. Their support will be crucial in determining whether the deal will sink or float just 17 days before Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union after 46 years in the fold. All eyes will be on Attorney General Geoffrey Cox the government\\'s chief legal advisor. He will publish updated advice on the Brexiteers\\' key concern: whether Monday\\'s new agreements could still leave Britain trapped in a permanent customs union with the EU against its will. \"It\\'s make your mind up time for all of us\" Environment Secretary Michael Gove one of the few Brexiteers left in the cabinet told BBC radio. \"If we don\\'t take the prize tonight the risk is that we will see a diluted softer or less palatable Brexit deal.\" The vote in parliament\\'s lower House of Commons is scheduled to take place from 7:00 pm (1900 GMT). Backstop fix May raced to Strasbourg late Monday for last-ditch talks with EU leaders in a bid to salvage the Brexit deal agreed between them. The two sides then announced a three-part package of legally-binding changes to the old agreement. They are aimed at addressing the key sticking point for British MPs when they rejected the deal in January: the so-called backstop plan to keep the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland free-flowing. \"Now is the time to come together to back this improved Brexit deal and to deliver on the instruction of the British people\" May said. European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said: \"It\\'s this deal or Brexit might not happen at all... There will be no third chance.\" But late Monday Britain\\'s main opposition Labour Party announced it would vote against the deal. The agreement \"does not contain anything approaching the changes Theresa May promised parliament\" said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Their rejection of the deal makes the response of the Conservative rebels and the DUP all the more important. Another defeat on Tuesday would tee up additional votes on the way ahead. If the deal is voted down MPs will vote on Wednesday on whether Britain should simply leave on March 29 without any deal at all. That option is fraught with economic dangers and is backed only by hardcore proponents of the divorce. If MPs vote against a \"no-deal\" scenario they would vote again on Thursday on requesting a delay to Brexit from the EU. The other 27 nations would need to back the extension unanimously and decide how long it should be. Their leaders will meet in Brussels for a summit on March 21-22. Any postponement may have to be short-lived. Juncker on Monday said a delay beyond European Parliament elections at the end of May would mean Britain would have to take part in the polls. \\'Dark cloud\\': Irish PM The problematic backstop was designed to keep the border on the island of Ireland - between EU member the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland which is part of the UK - invisible and free-flowing. If new trade arrangements between Britain and the EU cannot be agreed the UK would stick closely to EU trade rules until the sides reach a new trade deal. But those who back Brexit fear getting trapped in a quasi-union with Europe indefinitely. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar welcomed the new guarantees agreed by May and Juncker. \"Brexit has been a dark cloud over us for many months and particularly the threat of no deal\" he said in a statement. \"A positive vote tonight can remove that cloud and restore confidence and optimism in Britain Ireland and across the European Union.\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte also said he was pleased with the agreement. \"An orderly Brexit is crucial for both the EU and the UK. I hope that the House of Commons will support the agreement reached by Theresa May. There is no alternative\" he said. The pound extended its rally in Asian trade on Tuesday. Sterling has risen about 1.5% against the dollar since late Friday while it is up around 2% on the euro. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

That is the conclusion of a study commissioned last year by Bertelsmann Stiftung in collaboration with the Centre of International Economics at the Ifo Institut University of Munich.

Britain’s creditworthiness is under pressure due to uncertainty over the result of Brexit negotiations one of the world’s leading rating agencies has warned. Moody’s said it remained unclear whether the government would be able to deliver a reasonably good outcome from Brexit. It also warned that growth prospects over the medium term will be materially weaker if it fails to secure good access to the single market after withdrawal from the EU. While the base case scenario remains that the UK and EU will forge a free trade agreement the chances of an abrupt and damaging exit under World Trade Organisation rules has increased as a result of the government pursuing a hard Brexit said the agency’s annual report on the UK. Moody’s warned that the British economy is likely to weaken significantly over the rest of 2017. GDP growth is forecast to fall from 1.8 per cent in 2016 to 1.5 per cent this year and one per cent in 2018 due to falling demand from household consumption and “persistently weak capital formation”. Political and fiscal risks have heightened as a result of the loss of Theresa May’s parliamentary majority in the snap election which led the government to drop a number of cash-saving proposals and resulted in “significant” pressure for increased public spending. The UK’s sovereign rating of Aa1 negative – reduced from stable following last year’s EU referendum – could be downgraded further if the progress of Brexit negotiations suggested the government might not be able to preserve core elements of single market access said Moody’s. However a trade agreement limiting the economic fallout from Brexit could see it revised back up to stable. “While the negotiations with the EU have recently started it remains unclear whether the UK government can eventually deliver a reasonably good outcome for the UK” said Moody’s senior vice president Kathrin Muehlbronner the author of the report. “The likelihood of an abrupt – and damaging – exit with no agreement and reversion to WTO trading rules has increased compared to our expectation directly after the referendum.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Chris Sant Fournier  Applications for Maltese citizenship filed every year by British nationals have almost doubled in number since the 2016 Brexit vote. A total of 619 applications for citizenship by naturalisation were received last year compared to 382 in 2016 government data shows. The upward trend continued this year with 704 UK nationals applying to become Maltese citizens in the first 10 months. Such citizenship applications were distinct from those filed under the Individual Investors’ Programme (IIP) and neither were they for residence permits or visas a spokesman for the Office of the Prime Minister said. Applicants qualified for such citizenship either through a familial connection or after having resided in Malta for several years he added. The Brexit effect on citizenship applications is evident when pre-2016 figures are considered. Applications for citizenship from UK nationals numbered 203 in 2013 dropping to 152 in 2014 and rising to 199 the following year. 704 UK nationals applied to become Maltese citizens in the first 10 months A total of 1715 applications from UK nationals were approved since 2013 the spokesman said. In the June 23 2016 referendum the British voted to withdraw from the European Union. Months later the UK government began the formal process to exit the EU. As a result British citizens risk losing the right to free movement across EU member states apart from a raft of social rights they are entitled to as EU members. Negotiations took a dramatic turn on Thursday when Brexit secretary Dominic Raab resigned in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May’s proposed deal. More resignations followed.\\xa0 Last September practically all EU leaders including Prime Minister Joseph Muscat had called for a second referendum on Brexit but Ms May ruled out the possibility. Malta was not the only EU member state to witness an increase in citizenship applications following the Brexit vote. According to the Independent of London Eurostat figures show that 6555 British nationals acquired citizenship of another EU member state in 2016 up from 2478 the previous year. Germany was the Britons’ preferred choice attracting\\xa0 2702 UK nationals. France and Belgium followed with 517 and 506 citizens each the Independent reported. A spokesman for the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign had dubbed the flurry of applications “a Brexodus”. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

London stocks rallied yesterday and the pound rebounded from no-deal Brexit fears while traders awaited the outcome of a Federal Reserve policy meeting and crunch trade talks between China and the United States. British Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday won a mandate from UK lawmakers to try to renegotiate her Brexit deal. She is now hoping to unlock the impasse despite Brussels insisting that it will not budge. “The pound initially fell however because (the) vote leaves a no-deal Brexit on the table” said Neil Wilson chief market analyst at Markets.com. Having comprehensively re-jected the Brexit withdrawal agreement last month British MPs late on Tuesday backed an amendment saying they would support the deal if its controversial “backstop” clause concerning the Irish border was removed. Minori Uchida Tokyo head of global markets research at MUFG Bank said market players “are still thinking that a hard Brexit will be avoided in the end” even if “the optimism is groundless”. With Britain otherwise on course for a chaotic exit from the bloc on March 29 Ms May faces a formidable challenge convincing Brussels to re-open an accord that took 18 months to conclude. US stocks opened higher meanwhile with China monetary policy and earnings in focus. Meanwhile earnings at Dow members Apple and Boeing and data on private sector hiring all came in better than expected. Traders are looking ahead to the end of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting with hopes for some guidance on its plans for US interest rates this year. Yesterday also saw the start of high-level US-China trade talks with Beijing’s top trade negotiator due to meet Donald Trump during a two-day gathering. However while markets have been supported by optimism over the talks in recent weeks the US decision Monday to charge Chinese telecom titan Huawei on several counts of fraud and tech theft has muddied the waters. Still Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin insisted the two issues were not linked and said he saw the chance of a trade deal if China offered the right concessions. “Some dealers have been sitting on their hands in advance of the meeting as a hopes aren’t overly high” said CMC Markets analyst David Madden. “Mnuchin stated he expects ‘significant progress’ to be made but given the strained relationship between the US and China over the Huawei situation the trade talks might suffer.” Shares in Apple rose 5.1 per cent as trading opened while those in Boeing climbed 6.0 per cent. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Theresa May is facing a Commons showdown with Tory Brexiteers determined to force her to abandon her controversial blueprint for leaving the European Union. Amid rising backbench anger MPs are set to vote on Monday on a series of Commons amendments intended to wreck her Chequers plan for a \"common rule book\" covering a new \"UK-EU free trade area\". Although the measures are unlikely to pass in the absence of Labour support it could prove an opportunity for a show of strength by the rebels intended to pressurise her into retreat. Meanwhile US president Donald Trump said Mrs May needed a \"carve out\" in any Brexit agreement to ensure the UK can make a deal with the US. He told Good Morning Britain: \"I think we\\'re going to have a great trade deal. \"Now if they do whatever they do they have to... I said make sure that you have a carve out. \"You know I\\'ve called it a carve out for this. You have to have a carve out where no matter what happens they have the right to make a deal with the United States.\" Jacob Rees-Mogg the leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) played down suggestions over the weekend they were seeking to topple Mrs May saying she still had time to change course on her proposals. However the danger to the Prime Minister was underlined by the disclosure that Brexiteers had set up a Whatsapp group to co-ordinate voting tactics organised by ex-Brexit minister Steve Baker who quit over the Chequers plan. The Daily Telegraph reported more than 100 MPs had joined the group - more than double the 48 needed to submit letters of no confidence in the Prime Minister to force a leadership contest. The only solution is to take the final Brexit decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians away from the backroom deals and give it back to the people Mr Rees-Mogg said ERG members would be meeting ahead of the Commons debate and votes on the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill - or Customs Bill as it is more generally referred to - when the level of support for the amendments would become clearer. \"I\\'ve put down some amendments and we\\'ll see what support they get\" he said on Sunday. \"We\\'ll have an idea of the numbers I suppose at 10 o\\'clock on Monday evening.\" The threat from the Brexiteers is not the only danger facing Mrs May with pro-EU Tories tabling amendments of their own to the Customs Bill and the Trade Bill - which returns to the Commons on Tuesday - which would keep Britain in a customs union with the EU. It was unclear whether they will actually press them to a vote after some pro-EU MPs backed Mrs May\\'s Chequers plan and EU white paper. However in a sign of just how volatile the party has become former education secretary Justine Greening - who backed Remain - denounced the plan saying it offered the \"worst of both worlds\" and called for a second referendum. \"The only solution is to take the final Brexit decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians away from the backroom deals and give it back to the people\" she said in an article for The Times. Former international development secretary Priti Patel who is proposing one of four amendments to the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill told BBC Radio 4\\'s Westminster Hour the white paper had \"many flaws around our independence and our ability to make free trade agreements\". She added: \"Things have moved on from that very clear message that Brexit means Brexit and that is why we are rightfully questioning the legislation putting forward new clauses and amendments and saying not just to the Prime Minister but the whole of government reconsider look again and work with us.\" Meanwhile Boris Johnson in his first public intervention since his resignation last week appealed for people to take a more positive view of Britain\\'s prospects outside the EU. In sign that he was keeping his powder dry he said in an article for The Daily Telegraph that he would resist \"for now\" the temptation \"to bang on about Brexit\". \"It is time for all of us - at this critical moment in our constitutional development - to believe in ourselves to believe in the British people and what they can do and in our democracy\" he wrote. \"People around the world believe passionately in Britain. It\\'s time we shared their confidence.\" In a BBC television interview on Sunday Mrs May said she understood the strength of feelings driving the Brexit debate. However she insisted her plan offered the only workable solution to maintain \"frictionless\" trade with the EU and avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic while allowing the UK to strike trade deals around the world. \"Many people voted from the heart to leave the European Union\" she said. \"My job as Prime Minister is to deliver for them but also I\\'ve got to be hard-headed and practical about this and do it in a way that ensures we get the best interests for the UK.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Theresa May is facing calls to abandon her Brexit \"red lines\" after aerospace giant Airbus warned it could pull out of the UK with the loss of thousands of jobs if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. The company which employs 14000 people at 25 sites across the country said it would \"reconsider its investments in the UK and its long-term footprint in the country\" if Britain were forced to leave the single market and customs union in March 2019 without any transition agreement in place. The statement was greeted with dismay by unions opposition parties and pro-EU Tories who called on ministers to come up with a \"pragmatic sensible Brexit\" which protected trade and jobs. The government insisted the negotiations with Brussels were making \"good progress\" and it was confident that a \"no deal scenario\" would not arise. However Airbus said that it had been trying to raise its concerns about where the negotiations were heading for the past year without success. Conservative former Welsh secretary Stephen Crabb said the firm\\'s warning should be a wake-up call for ministers. \"The enormous Airbus factory in North Wales is one of the jewels in the crown of UK manufacturing. A pragmatic sensible Brexit that protects trade and jobs is vital\" he said.\\xa0Ministers need to start listening to legitimate concerns of businesses and get a grip of the Brexit negotiations For Labour shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said Ms May needed to drop her Brexit \"red lines\". \"The government\\'s reckless decision to keep no deal on the table and to rule out a customs union or strong single market deal after Brexit is putting jobs and the economy at risk\" he said. \"Ministers need to start listening to legitimate concerns of businesses and get a grip of the Brexit negotiations.\" Unite\\'s assistant general secretary Steve Turner said it was imperative the government avoided a \"cliff edge\" Brexit. \"It would be a betrayal of Airbus workers their families and the tens of thousands of workers in the wider supply chain if the Government failed to secure frictionless trade and access to the customs union and single market\" he said. However former Ukip leader Nigel Farage suggested the warnings were exaggerated. \"Twenty years ago I heard car manufacturers saying if Britain didn\\'t join the euro they may well consider pulling out of Britain - Nissan others like that\" he told Sky News. \"Big business will always lobby for their interests of course they will.\" In a Brexit \"risk assessment\" published on its website Airbus called on the government to extend the planned transition period due to run until December 2020 saying it was too short for the business to reorganise its supply chain. Tom Williams the chief operating officer of Airbus Commercial Aircraft said Brexit would have \"severe negative consequences\" for the UK aerospace industry whether or not there was an agreement with Brussels. \"While Airbus understands that the political process must go on as a responsible business we require immediate details on the pragmatic steps that should be taken to operate competitively he said.  \"Without these Airbus believes that the impacts on our UK operations could be significant. \"We have sought to highlight our concerns over the past 12 months without success. Far from Project Fear this is a dawning reality for Airbus. Put simply a no-deal scenario directly threatens Airbus\\' future in the UK.\" A government spokeswoman said that while officials were working closely with companies to understand their concerns they did not expect a \"no deal\" scenario to arise. \"We have made significant progress towards agreeing a deep and special partnership with the EU to ensure trade remains as free and frictionless as possible including in the aerospace sector and we\\'re confident of getting a good deal that is mutually beneficial\" the spokeswoman said. Downing Street denied that ministers had ignored concerns raised by Airbus about the Brexit negotiations. \"Airbus were in Downing Street with the PM in April as part of an aerospace round table\" a No 10 spokeswoman said. \"(Business Secretary) Greg Clark spoke to them earlier this week and officials will speak to them today so we are listening to their concerns. There is an open dialogue there and we continue to talk to them.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

US President Donald Trump said a free trade deal with Britain might be impossible if London went ahead with Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s proposals for post-Brexit ties with the European Union in damaging remarks that could widen domestic criticism of her plans. In an interview with Britain\\'s Sun newspaper published late on Thursday Trump said May\\'s plans for a business-friendly Brexit would leave it too close to the EU to allow a new trans-Atlantic trade deal to be struck. Just hours earlier at a lavish dinner to mark Trump\\'s first visit to Britain as president May made a direct pitch for a deal with Washington. She praised the friendship between the two allies glossing over Trump\\'s previous remarks that Britain was a \"hot spot\" in turmoil over Brexit. Referring to May\\'s Brexit proposals Trump told the Sun Britain\\'s top-selling newspaper: \"If they do a deal like that we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK so it will probably kill the deal.\"May\\'s plans for a business-friendly Brexit would leave it too close to the EU to allow a new trans-Atlantic trade deal to be struck Trump chastised May for ignoring his advice on Brexit and not making a credible threat to walk away from talks. \"I would have done it much differently\" he told the Sun which urged its readers to back Brexit before a referendum in June 2016. \"I actually told Theresa May how to do it but she didn\\'t listen to me.\" His comments came at the end of a tumultuous few days for May during which two senior ministers resigned in protest at her plans for trade with the EU after Britain leaves the bloc next March. Trump said that one of them former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson \"would be a great Prime Minister.\" After the story was published White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the president \"likes and respects Prime Minister May very much\" adding that he said in the interview she \"is a very good person” and that he \"never said anything bad about her\". Trump is due to have lunch with May on Friday. Her office had no immediate reaction to his remarks beyond referring back to her speech. May has previously said she does not believe her Brexit plans should rule out a trade deal with the United States. Trump has frequently angered British politicians. Late last year May criticised him for retweeting a message by a member of a British far-right group and the speaker of Britain\\'s parliament has said Trump would not be welcome to address it. May\\'s critics have said however that she reins in criticism of Trump because of the strong desire of many in her Conservative Party to reach a trade deal with the United States after Brexit. May\\'s \"business-friendly\" Brexit plan would keep Britain in a free trade zone for goods with the EU but mean it had to accept some EU rules. It was agreed by her Cabinet only last Friday after two years of wrangling since Britons voted to leave the bloc in the referendum. Some Brexit supporters have cast May\\'s Brexit plan as a betrayal including lawmakers in her own deeply divided party who have warned of a leadership challenge. \\'DEAREST OF FRIENDS\\' Before the Sun interview was published May invoked Winston Churchill as she addressed Trump and business leaders at a black-tie dinner at Blenheim Palace the grand 18th century country house that was the birthplace of the British World War Two leader. \"Mr President Sir Winston Churchill once said that \\'to have the United States at our side was to me the greatest joy\\'\" May told Trump according to a text of her speech.A couple of thousand demonstrators lined the road and booed Trump\\'s arrival \"The spirit of friendship and cooperation between our countries our leaders and our people that most special of relationships has a long and proud history\" she said adding that the United States was \"not just the closest of allies but the dearest of friends\". Outside the mansion near Oxford to the northwest of London a couple of thousand demonstrators lined the road and booed Trump\\'s arrival. It was one of over a hundred protests police expected during Trump\\'s four-day trip.  \"I think it’s a travesty of British values. How can we roll out the red carpet for someone who stands for everything we stand against?\" said academic Emily Jones 40 one of those protesting outside Blenheim Palace. While Trump\\'s trip was not the full state visit he was originally promised he was heralded by military bands on his arrival in the country and at Blenheim and he is scheduled on Friday to have tea with Queen Elizabeth. He is then due to spend two days at golf courses he owns in Scotland before travelling to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Sun said its interview with Trump was conducted in Brussels where the NATO summit was held earlier in the week. Trump attended the summit where he provoked a crisis session to force allies to raise their defence spending. Liam Fox Britain\\'s trade minister tweeted after the Sun interview was published that it was terrific to hear Trump \"talk so positively about UK & US Trade tonight at Blenheim Palace\". \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The Malta Stock Exchange index extended its recent winning streak having advanced by 0.45 per cent despite a marginal fall of 0.5 per cent yesterday following the announcement that Britain had voted to leave the EU\\u2008in a referendum.

HSBC Bank Malta plc shares closed unchanged at €1.60 as 18253 shares changed ownership across 12 deals. On Thursday HSBC announced that it has recognised an amount of €7.6 million as income from the cash consideration and preferred stock convertibles into ordinary shares it held in Visa Europe Limited which was acquired by Visa Inc. on June 21 2016. This one-off gain will be accounted for in the ‘net operating income’ in the income statement for the period ending June 30 2016. Another cash payment will be made in 2019 estimated at €1.4 million. Similarly Bank of Valletta plc received total consideration of €29 million which will be reflected in the bank’s financial statements for the financial year ending September 30 2016 with a deferred cash payment including interest to follow in three years’ time.

The company published the statement of opinion of its board of directors with reference to the offer document published on June 14 2016 by TT ML Limited a fully owned subsidiary of Société Nationale des Télécommunications (Tunisie Telecom). GO said the acquisition will be beneficial to the company as Tunisie Telecom is committed to continue investing in Malta and to support GO’s investments in other segments including 4G the FTTH roll-out and expansion of data centres.

Following are some of the key reactions to Tuesday night\\'s huge defeat for British Prime Minister Theresa May. European Union \"I urge the United Kingdom to clarify its intentions as soon as possible. Time is almost up\" -- European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. \"The Withdrawal Agreement is a fair compromise and the best possible deal. It reduces the damage caused by Brexit for citizens and businesses across Europe. It is the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. \"The risk of a disorderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom has increased with this evening\\'s vote. While we do not want this to happen the European Commission will continue its contingency work to help ensure the EU is fully prepared.\" \"If a deal is impossible and no one wants no deal then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?\" -- EU Council president Donald Tusk who added the remaining EU27 \"will remain united\". \"It\\'s now up to the British government to say what the next stage is. The EU will remain united and determined to find a deal.\" -- The EU\\'s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. Germany \"This is a bitter day for Europe. We are well prepared -- but a hard Brexit would be the least attractive choice for the EU and GB (Great Britain).\" -- German Finance Minister and Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz. \"A hard Brexit will be the worst of all options.\" -- Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel\\'s centre-right CDU party and her likely successor. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said delaying Brexit beyond March 29 would make no sense. \"It would only make sense if there is a path to the goal of a deal between the EU and Great Britain.\" France \"Either way we will have to negotiate a transition period with them because the British cannot afford to no longer have planes taking off or landing at home and their supermarkets as much as 70 percent are supplied by continental Europe.\" -- President Emmanuel Macron. \"Second option they tell us... \\'We\\'ll try to improve what we can get from the Europeans and then hold the vote again. \"In that case we\\'ll look into it. Maybe we\\'ll make improvements on one or two things but I don\\'t really think so because we\\'ve reached the maximum of what we could do with the deal.\" France\\'s Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau said the EU could push back the March 29 deadline if London made such a request. \"Legally technically it\\'s possible.\" Ireland- \"Regrettably the outcome of tonight\\'s vote increases the risk of a disorderly Brexit. Consequently the government will continue to intensify preparations for such an outcome.\" -- Government statement. Austria \"In any case there will be no renegotiations on the withdrawal agreement.\" -- Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz in a tweet. Italy\"Preparations for all scenarios will continue and be intensified including the inauspicious scenario of a withdrawal without a deal on March 29.\" - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. Spain \"An unordered exit would be negative for the EU and catastrophic for the UK.\" -- Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  To leave or not to leave: Two and a half years since the United Kingdom voted to exit the EU that is still the question. The crisis in Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s government over her draft Brexit divorce deal has stirred interest in the possibility that the United Kingdom could change its mind or \\'regrexit\\'. In the June 23 2016 referendum 17.4 million voters or 52 percent backed Brexit while 16.1 million or 48 percent backed staying in the bloc. But ever since opponents of Brexit have been exploring ways to hold another referendum. May has repeatedly said there will not be another referendum on membership and the leader of the main opposition party Jeremy Corbyn has indicated he is also not in favour. So what is the path to a second vote? The first step according to campaigners is that parliament rejects May\\'s draft divorce deal. To leave the EU on the terms of her deal May would need the backing of parliament. The size of the rebellion inside her Conservative Party and the anger of her allies in the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party indicate she would have trouble passing the deal even with significant support from Labour Party lawmakers. \"I suspect it will get to parliament and parliament will vote it down and once that happens it will be game on for a People\\'s Vote\" said Hugo Dixon deputy chair of the People\\'s Vote campaign group which wants another referendum. \"Voting down a deal does not mean we crash out with no deal at all; it means we are highly likely to move to a People\\'s Vote with an option to stay in the EU\" Dixon said. \"The no deal scenario is not likely\" The collapse of May\\'s deal would thrust the United Kingdom deeper into crisis. Three of the four former British prime ministers still alive - John Major Tony Blair and Gordon Brown - have said a second referendum is the way to resolve the crisis. \"I still believe it is possible that Brexit is stopped\" Blair told Reuters last month. The opposition Labour Party which is also divided over Brexit has indicated it would seek to trigger a national election if May failed to get parliamentary approval. But to secure an election two thirds of the 650 lawmakers in parliament would have to vote for one. Another way is if a motion of no confidence in the government is passed. There is then a 14-day grace period in which to pass an act of confidence in a new government. If there is no vote of confidence in that new government then a new election must be held within about 17 working days according to the Institute of Government. Brexit campaigners think Labour would fail to trigger an election. After what would have been weeks of crisis and the failure of various other options - an election a new prime minister attempts to renegotiate with the EU - parliament would finally demand a new referendum. The exact mechanism is unclear but lawmakers could vote for a motion calling for a new referendum as a way out of the deadlock. That would have to be backed up by legislation calling a referendum. Theresa May faces an uphill battle to win her cabinet colleagues over. Photo: Reuters Holding a referendum would take months so the European Union would have to be asked for more time as the United Kingdom is currently on course to leave at 2300 GMT on March 29 2019. Key to asking for more time is the question of whether the United Kingdom could withdraw Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon nearly two years after May invoked it. As the clause has never been used before lawyers have a diverse range of opinions on its reversibility or not. But the British diplomat who drafted the clause John Kerr has repeatedly argued that it can be reversed. \"The die is not irrevocably cast there is still time and until the UK has left the EU the Article 50 letter can be withdrawn\" Kerr who was British ambassador to the EU from 1990 to 1995 said in \"The Roadmap to a People\\'s Vote\".\\xa0 Judges at the European Union’s highest court will hear a case on the Brexit process on Nov. 27 reviewing whether Britain could unilaterally withdraw its decision to leave the EU. Unclear. Many supporters of Brexit say that holding such a vote would thrust the United Kingdom into its biggest ever constitutional crisis and possibly even provoke disorder. While polls and academic research show that the country remains divided a survey of 20000 voters published this month showed it would vote to stay in the EU. https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-poll/regrexit-british-voters-would-now-back-staying-in-the-eu-poll-shows-idUKKCN1NA2KL Many surveys ahead of the vote incorrectly predicted that Britain would vote to stay in the club it joined in 1973. But a vote to leave in a second referendum would surely mean the country would have to leave. It\\'s not clear of course. Jo Johnson younger brother of Boris resigned from the government earlier this month calling for another referendum. People should be asked \"whether they want to go ahead with Brexit now that we know the deal that is actually available to us whether we should leave without any deal at all or whether people on balance would rather stick with the deal we already have inside the European Union\" he said. Supporters of Brexit say having two options for Brexit and one for remain would be unfair as it would split the vote for Brexit. The prospect of the world\\'s fifth largest economy returning to the fold would surely be welcomed by most EU leaders. European Council President Donald Tusk said this week that the EU is prepared to cancel Brexit. French President Emmanuel Macron for example has suggested Britain could still change its mind. Opponents of the idea of a second referendum say it would not solve anything even if voters chose to stay in the EU. Supporters of Brexit would then demand a third decisive referendum to resolve the question that has haunted the United Kingdom since it lost its empire: Should it go it alone or partner with the European project? \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Addressing a press conference Dr Busuttil said he was offering the Nationalist Party's “significant experience” in EU matters. Brexit could have a number of repercussions on Malta its economy and its citizens. “I want it to be absolutely clear that my priority is to secure the national interest” he said. Reacting to comments by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat earlier today Dr Busuttil said he hoped it was true that the government was prepared to handle Brexit and get the best result for Malta. Asked if he felt the country was prepared to handle any possible economic turmoil that could come out of the UK’s exit from the EU Dr Busuttil said a previous PN administration had navigated an economic crisis and this required a strong economic vision as well as good governance. Dr Busuttil also reacted to Dr Muscat’s comments that it would be suicidal for Malta to consider a departure from the EU. He said he was pleased to note that the Prime Minister who had argued against EU membership had changed his tone and now acknowledged the virtue of joining. “It is undeniable that Malta is strong in the EU and has benefited tremendously” Dr Busuttil said. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May will on Monday chair a potentially volatile meeting of her cabinet amid reports of an attempted coup by colleagues over her handling of Brexit. May will meet the very ministers said to be plotting to oust her at the start of another crucial week in Britain\\'s withdrawal from the European Union which could see MPs seize control of the process from the government.\\xa0 Lawmakers are set to vote later Monday on whether to force through the House of Commons a series of so-called \"indicative votes\" to gauge support for various Brexit options. Meanwhile May must decide when or even if to ask them to vote again on her divorce deal - finalised with the EU last year - which they have already overwhelmingly rejected twice. Under a new timetable imposed by European leaders last week she now has until April 12 to win MPs\\' backing for the agreement or find a viable alternative which could include a lengthy extension to Brexit. However after a disastrous last week the increasingly isolated leader spent the weekend ensconced at her country residence Chequers \"at the mercy of a full-blown cabinet coup\" according to the Sunday Times. The newspaper said it had spoken to 11 senior ministers who \"confirmed that they wanted the prime minister to make way for someone else\" and planned to confront her at Monday\\'s cabinet. Such gatherings usually take place on Tuesdays but Downing Street confirmed one was scheduled for 10.00am (1000 GMT) Monday. Ministers identified as potential interim replacements played down the reports.\\xa0 \"It\\'s not the time to change the captain of the ship\" said Environment Minister and leading Brexiteer Michael Gove. But Brexit-backing tabloid The Sun Britain\\'s best-selling daily called for May to announce Monday that she will resign as soon as her deal is approved and Britain leaves the EU. Under the headline \"Time\\'s up Theresa\" the paper said that was the \"only one slim chance\" her deal would have of getting parliamentary backing. \\'Sufficient support\\'  Parliament has been deadlocked for months over Brexit with MPs unable to decide how to implement the 2016 referendum vote to leave reflecting bitter divisions nationwide. On Saturday organisers estimated one million pro-Europeans marched through central London demanding another public vote on leaving the bloc. Meanwhile an online petition demanding Brexit be halted passed five million signatures on Sunday. Following last week\\'s delay to the country\\'s March 29 scheduled departure - which MPs must still vote into law this week - the way forward remains highly unpredictable. If May\\'s deal finally wins parliamentary approval Britain will leave the EU on May 22. It was expected to face another vote this week but the prime minister has told lawmakers signs of \"sufficient support\" are needed first. With her parliamentary allies the Democratic Unionist Party indicating Friday that they remain opposed to her plan that appears lacking. On Sunday Tory Brexiteers outside government including influential MP Jacob Rees-Mogg and former foreign minister Boris Johnson - widely seen as wanting to replace May - travelled to Chequers for talks. \"It\\'s looking very difficult to bring together a majority for it\" finance minister Philip Hammond earlier conceded to Sky News. However \"one way or another parliament is going to have the opportunity this week to decide what it is in favour of\" he added. \\'Constitutional collision\\' MPs will resume debate on Brexit on Monday with the chance to vote on an amendment tabled by a cross-party group of senior lawmakers scheduling \"indicative votes\" on Wednesday. A similar move\\xa0earlier this month failed by just two votes.\\xa0 If passed lawmakers will be able to vote on various options from stopping Brexit altogether or holding a second referendum to remaining in a customs union with the EU or its single market. MPs may then try to turn their non-binding votes into enforceable law. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay an ardent eurosceptic warned Sunday it could prompt a general election because most alternatives go against Conservative manifesto promises in the 2017 election. \"There is a constitutional collision if parliament is instructing a government to do something that is fundamentally against what it has been elected to do\" he told the BBC. But in a sign of the splits within the cabinet Hammond appeared more open-minded if May\\'s deal remains blocked. In a departure from government policy he described holding a second referendum as \"a coherent proposition and it deserves to be considered along with the other proposals\".

Photo: Shutterstock  Former UK Labour leader Ed Miliband has held talks with pro-EU Tory MPs on trying to force Theresa May to allow a Commons vote on any moves to exit the single market.A loose cross-party alliance of pro-Europe MPs from all sides of the Commons has expressed concern at the sudden pace towards a \"hard Brexit\" stance by the Government. Mr Miliband is considering tabling an urgent Commons question demanding the Prime Minister sets out to parliament exactly what its role will be in the major decisions surrounding Brexit. The former Labour leader and ex-Lib Dem head Nick Clegg have formed common ground with the SNP the Greens and some Tories to seek a strong voice for the Commons in the Brexit process. The grouping believes that while Britain narrowly voted to leave the EU it did not vote to leave the single market. Mr Miliband said that parliament must remain sovereign. \"Having claimed that the referendum was about returning sovereignty to Britain it would be a complete outrage if May were to determine the terms of Brexit without a mandate from parliament. \"There is no mandate for hard Brexit and I don\\'t believe there is a majority in parliament for it either. Given the importance of these decisions for the UK economy ... it has to be a matter for MPs\" he told the Observer. Mr Clegg said the decisions were too big to be taken by Downing Street alone.\"My great worry is that while there will be a vote on repealing the 1972 European Communities Act which is about the decision to leave the EU it will be left to the executive alone to decide the terms of Brexit. That would not be remotely acceptable\" he told the newspaper. The move comes after leaders of the CBI expressed alarm at the apparent direction of Government policy towards a hard Brexit option which they say could see tariffs imposed on 90% of British exports. The business chiefs have demanded Mrs May rules out the \"worst options\" of a hard Brexit such as not having \"passporting\" arrangements which allow easy access to European markets for the financial service industry. Mrs May has said she will open the two-year \"divorce\" negotiations with Brussels by the end of next March but has made it clear she does not want a Commons vote on the matter beforehand. The PM has insisted that immigration controls are a post-Brexit priority but German chancellor Angela Merkel has insisted such a move would be incompatible with the UK remaining in the single market. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: AFP  In its attempts to find a way out of the Brexit impasse the House of Commons has passed an amendment that gives Theresa May the green light to reopen talks with the European Union about what happens to the Irish border after Brexit – a key sticking point in getting her deal through parliament. MPs have also voted to reject a no-deal Brexit. And in a final development on a busy day in the Brexit story opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has also agreed to enter talks with the prime minister to find a way forward. But many of these developments raise more questions than they answer. The Irish backstop is an issue which has caused frustration not just on the Conservative benches but also with the government’s confidence-and-supply partner the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The amendment which was passed on this topic was tabled by Graham Brady a Conservative backbencher and chairman of the party’s 1922 Committee. It commits the prime minister to seeking “alternative arrangements” for the backstop though during the debate that came ahead of the vote government ministers repeatedly refused to be drawn on what those alternative arrangements might be. As the countdown to March 29 continues this will be seen by many as a sign that progress is being made as there is a majority in favour of an amended deal. Yet in parliamentary terms the UK is no closer to leaving with a deal than it was in December. The prime minister still has a lot of work to do.\\xa0The backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement and the withdrawal agreement is not open for re-negotiation May nevertheless sees the amendment as giving her a firm mandate to return to the EU and seek a new version of the Brexit deal. In a further sign that she has heeded the concerns of her own backbenchers the prime minister also agreed to sit down and discuss the so called “Malthouse Compromise” – a proposal on the backstop agreed in secret between Conservative Brexiteers and Remainers and facilitated by some government ministers. It is not a parliamentary amendment but is an important behind-the-scenes movement as the government strives to reach some sort of consensus among MPs. That said while the prime minister may have her mandate to push for an amended deal the EU has said it does not wish to renegotiate terms. In a statement released shortly after the vote a spokesman for European Council president Donald Tusk said: “The backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement and the withdrawal agreement is not open for re-negotiation.” May will be hoping that with 317 MPs firmly behind her Brussels will shift ground. The surprise of the night was a narrow eight-vote victory for an amendment tabled by Conservative MP Caroline Spelman and Labour MP Jack Dromey. It aims to prevent a no-deal Brexit though it does not come with legal underpinnings. Although it’s unlikely that the government thought this amendment would pass it’s potency is somewhat muted given that the prime minister has consistently said that passing amendments of this form are a waste of time; and that the only way to stop no deal is to vote for a deal. It’s unlikely to mean much other than emphasising that there is a political will in the Commons to avoid leaving the EU on March 29 without a deal. Jeremy Corbyn the leader of the opposition had refused any meetings with the prime minister over the past few weeks saying repeatedly that he would not do so without preconditions being met including the prime minister ruling out no deal. As a result he is the only opposition party leader not to have met with May as she seeks consensus – although it should be noted that she initially extended the invitation to everyone except Corbyn. Yet Corbyn has now had a change of heart following the vote opposing a no deal exit and agreed to a meeting. This could prove highly significant over the next couple of weeks – movement on the Labour benches could help May’s next proposition cross the finish line. An amendment from Dominic Grieve the Conservative backbencher who was largely responsible for forcing the government to come back to the Commons so soon after the meaningful vote last week failed to pass. The same went for Labour MP Yvette Cooper – whose amendment was only supported by leader of the opposition Jeremy Corbyn at the 11th hour. Both the Cooper and the Grieve amendments sought to suspend the usual Commons rules in which the government has control of business and give more power to the Commons to control the Brexit process. The Grieve amendment would have allowed MPs to vote on a series of options for the withdrawal process while the Cooper amendment sought to avoid a no-deal Brexit by making it legally binding on the prime minister to extend Article 50 if parliament had not agreed on a final Brexit deal by February 26. More MPs than expected voted against the Cooper amendment – perhaps a sign that Conservative MPs realised the Brady amendment would bring greater rewards. The prime minister has said that she will go back to the EU and seek to reopen the Brexit package on offer. But with the EU currently saying it is unwilling to re-open talks on the deal it is unclear at the moment what her next steps will be. She will however continue to meet with MPs including senior Conservative backbenchers and the DUP as she works towards an amended offer for parliament. With the clear majority voting against a no-deal Brexit the ticking clock works in the prime minister’s favour. If the only way to avoid no deal is for parliament to take a favourable stance on an amended deal they may have to support her deal in one form or another. Parliament has a lot of work to do and it is running out of time in which to do it. There are limited sitting days between now and March 29 including a February recess. Assuming that an amended deal will be passed by the Commons next month the house will still need to debate (possibly) amend and pass a withdrawal agreement bill before the designated leave date. We may see the recess cancelled or the announcement of extra sitting days (Fridays could be used) between now and then. Either way it’s going to be an even busier month for MPs as the Brexit clock ticks down.

Photo: Shutterstock  Despite reports to the contrary French Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau has not named her cat \"Brexit\" her office said on Tuesday. Reports began circulating on Sunday after the Journal du Dimanche newspaper reported that the 54-year-old had written about her pet on her private Facebook page. \"I\\'ve ended up calling my cat Brexit\" the paper quoted Loiseau as writing. \"It wakes me up meowing like crazy every morning because it wants to go out but as soon as I open the door it just sits there undecided and then looks angry when I put it outside.\" The joke at British expense - an allusion to Britain\\'s inability to decide when and how it wants to leave the European Union - was picked up by numerous London-based newspapers and American media outlets and amplified on social media. But it was in fact just a joke as \"Brexit\" the cat - unlike the cat thought up as an experiment by Austrian physicist Erwin Schroedinger - is neither alive nor dead. It simply does not exist. \"It was a joke obviously\" Loiseau told Radio J on Sunday afternoon. \"I don\\'t have a cat.\" This did not stop her facing a question from a British journalist at EU negotiations in Brussels on Tuesday who enquired about her feline. \"I think I have to have a certain sense of humour to deal with Brexit. Not only me but my fellow citizens\" she replied. A member of her cabinet reached by telephone confirmed that the minister does not own a cat. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Sterling was under increasing pressure yesterday evening as British Prime Minister Theresa May was facing the prospect of a humiliating parliamentary defeat for her hard-fought Brexit deal. The pound drooped against the dollar and also lost ground against the euro with investors on tenterhooks before the vital vote. “The degree of political uncertainty in the UK means that economic news has been almost totally usurped” Rabobank analyst Jane Foley said. European stock markets meanwhile enjoyed cautious gains after Asia swung higher as worries dimmed over a global economic slowdown and Wall Street posted modest gains in the late New York morning. The London FTSE-100 stock index even outperformed its eurozone peers as equity investors welcomed a weaker pound. With a little over two months to go until Britain leaves the EU on March 29 lawmakers were almost certain to vote against Ms May’s deal \\xad \\xad– which was agreed with Brussels in a fraught and long-running process after the June 2016 referendum to leave the bloc. Economic news has been almost totally usurped Market pundits do not expect a “significant” swing following the outcome \\xad \\xad– but they do anticipate “fireworks” as the nature of Brexit becomes apparent in the coming days weeks and months. “The vote is a foregone conclusion so sterling is unlikely to move significantly” added Interactive Investor analyst Rebecca O’Keeffe. “However the range of possible outcomes after this crucial vote is what is far more interesting” she said. “From no Brexit which could see sterling move to $1.40-plus versus a hard Brexit which could see a move towards parity. “The fireworks will happen after today \\xad– when it is clear what happens next.” Elsewhere yesterday Asian equity markets rebounded from the previous day’s sharp losses with Hong Kong and Shanghai lifted by Chinese plans to slash taxes to boost the economy. China’s disappointing trade data on Monday sent shivers through trading floors as it showed the long-running US tariffs row is beginning to bite. But dealers resumed last week’s rally that was fuelled by optimism that Beijing and Washington will eventually resolve their differences \\xad– and that the US Federal Reserve will pause in raising interest rates. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Around a thousand dogs and their owners marched on Britain\\'s parliament on Sunday demanding an end to Brexit via a second vote on the terms of the country\\'s exit from the European Union. Organisers of the so-called \"Wooferendum\" campaign argued that animals would suffer from leaving the EU saying there would be a shortage of vets and a rise in pet food costs. Bulldogs both English and French breeds were among those walked through central London to Parliament Square. One grey Schnauzer wore a homemade banner declaring \"Brexit\\'s Barking Mad\". The march backed a wider campaign for a \\'People\\'s Vote\\' on Brexit at which Britons would have the chance to vote on whatever Brexit deal Prime Minister Theresa May is able to bring back from Brussels. At several \\'Pee Stations\\' along the route dogs were encouraged to urinate on images of Brexiteers like former foreign minister Boris Johnson and ex-UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage - key faces in the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Tory tensions over Brexit have broken into the open as the party gathers for a crunch conference in Manchester. Britain\\'s EU divorce deal and the scope of any post-withdrawal transition period looks set to dominate the Conservative gathering. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson caused waves on the eve of the conference as he insisted that any transition phase must not last \"a second more\" than two years. The intervention drew a stern rebuke from former education secretary Nicky Morgan who said people behaving like Mr Johnson have \"no place in a responsible government\". Mr Johnson said the UK should not have to abide by any new EU rules during a post-withdrawal transition period and that Britain should not make payments to Brussels after it. He said there can be \"no monkeying around\" about withdrawal from the EU. Mr Johnson - who insisted his stance was not a leadership pitch after a poll of activists showed him well favoured for the top job - said Brexit needed to happen quickly. Do I want the delay to go on longer than two years? Not a second more- Boris Johnson He told the Sun: \"Am I impatient about it do I want to get it done as fast as possible? Yes absolutely. Do I want the delay to go on longer than two years? Not a second more.\" Writing in the Independent Ms Morgan said: \"The UK Government should be focusing on getting the UK out of the EU in the least damaging way not debating arbitrary red lines set down to try to curry favour with those who want a utopian ultra-free trade low tax minimal regulation state. \"Those who are pushing this agenda have no place in a responsible government - it is a dereliction of the duty to act in the national interest. And it has to stop.\" Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson also entered the fray calling for \"serious people\" to take charge of the Brexit process. The spat came as a letter to the Prime Minister from senior pro-Brexit Tory MPs and business figures in the Leave Means Leave group stated: \"If the EU is not seriously negotiating a free trade deal by Christmas 2017 the Government should give formal notice that we will move to World Trade Organisation rules in March 2019.\" Signatories calling for the hardline stance include former Brexit minister David Jones and the issue is set to feature heavily at the Tory conference. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Foreign Secretary\\'s stance threatened a trade war with the EU. He said: \"It seems a pretty dysfunctional Government. I can\\'t imagine what it\\'s like sitting around a table with their Brexit negotiating team because there are three or four people with three or four completely different opinions. \"Boris this morning seems to be saying \\'two years maximum on the transition period and then no shadowing of EU rules\\'. Well that sounds to me like a threat to have a trade policy that undermines Europe. \"Therein lies the basis of a trade war of the future therein lies a threat to thousands and thousands of jobs in Britain. \"You have got to have a serious adult grown-up relationship with Europe.\" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said Mr Johnson\\'s intervention had undermined the Government\\'s Brexit negotiating position. \"Boris Johnson\\'s latest red line sends an appalling signal to EU negotiators who thought they were dealing with David Davis and Theresa May but now realise that the strings are being pulled by others\" he said. \"Senior Conservatives are displaying an abject failure to act together in the national interest and seem more motivated by selfish personal ambition.\" The Foreign Secretary\\'s comments come as Mrs May is attempting to assert her grip on her party ahead of its annual gathering. As the party faithful converge on Manchester the Prime Minister insisted Labour was \"unfit to govern\" as she pledged to listen to the concerns of young voters after the Tories\\' \"disappointing\" general election showing. Mr Johnson is also urging workers to be given a pay hike as he insisted the current minimum wage of £7.50 an hour - rising to £9 by 2020 - is \"not enough\". Transport Secretary Chris Grayling insisted the Cabinet was united on Brexit. He said: \"What I want from the Brexit talks and what Boris Johnson wants from the Brexit talks and indeed all of us around the Cabinet table want is the best possible deal for Britain.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Alexandros Michailidis/Shutterstock.com  Today was supposed to be Brexit’s Eve. Though it’s been delayed its wide impact on the EU has not. This week’s vote in the European Parliament concerning golden visa schemes and tax harmonisation is just one of three major reforming thrusts – on tax democratic oversight and choice of Commission President – we are likely to see in the short to medium term. Of course the Brexit referendum’s result had an immediate impact on the EU institutions. Some of the brightest in the Commission were deployed to deal with the negotiations while every part of the Brussels bureaucracy has had to deal with the implications for policy budgets and personnel. Tuesday’s vote however is one of the clearest signals of how the UK’s withdrawal will change the very nature of the Union. The UK is the major member state among those who joined before 2004 that has been consistently sceptical of deepening the Union’s political integration. Its absence will remove a major obstacle from the pursuit of such an agenda. Under the current dispensation tax harmonisation requires unanimity. In principle a change requires Malta’s vote however much the EU Commissioner responsible for tax Pierre Moscovici might say the relevant rules need to be changed to a majority vote. With the UK still a member the chances of the rules being changed would be impossible. With the UK out that prospect is still bleak but it’s now dimly possible. Brexit’s impact goes beyond financial affairs. The very result of the referendum together with the suspicions of illegal funding and Russian interference are also being flagged as an issue that may require pan-European attention and oversight. A European supervisory role has been broached by French President Emmanuel Macron in a series of reforms he has proposed for a bolstered Europe. In his sights are the populist movements in countries like Italy and Hungary. They have not just friendly relations with Vladimir Putin’s Russia; they’re also allies of the French far right. Beyond Italy and Hungary there are member states whose governments are seeing confidence in them soar even as their democratic credentials are weakened. The Bertelsmann Foundation’s Sustainable Governance Index shows Bulgaria Romania and Poland scoring weakly between the 35th to 40th globally (with Malta pegged at 35 with Bulgaria). It’s evident that Hungary’s ruling political party currently suspended from the European People’s Party cannot continue to be members of the EPP for long; nor can Romania’s Social Democrats continue to be members of the European Socialists. Both parties have more in common with the far-right represented by Matteo Salvini’s Lega and Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (the former National Front). Brexit will also enable the European establishment to return to an older agenda of deepening the Union Such a political realignment would contribute to a reshaping of the composition of the EP after the May elections. For the first time in 40 years the combined seats of the EPP and Socialists are expected to fall beneath the 50 per cent threshold. They should still be able to rule with the help of the liberals but the populists are expected to making a strong electoral showing. With such a result we can expect Brexit to have a third impact on the Union – the choice of President of the European Commission. The EPP and Socialists are of course contesting the MEP elections with the claim that the party that wins the most seats will have the right to nominate the Commission President; both have already indicated their respective candidate. But this is a claim not a fixed rule. The heads of government went along with it last time without accepting the principle. A strong populist vote could well provide a window of opportunity for politicians like Macron. The principle that the Commission President gets to be chosen by a political party becomes double-edged the moment it is possible to imagine that within 10 years the party doing the choosing could be a populist one. Anyone for a President favoured by Viktor Orban Le Pen and Salvini? Do not then be surprised if come June after the electoral dust clears the new president isn’t someone nominated by either the EPP or the Socialists. Take a bow Michel Barnier EU Brexit chief negotiator in acknowledgement of your hard work. If it does happen it will be a cunning choice. The EPP is likely to win the plurality of seats and it cannot object (well not very hard) to Barnier – he belongs to the party. The man pushing him Macron will bring on board the liberals. And why should the Socialists have strong preferences between one EPP candidate and another? Barnier’s expertise goes beyond the internal market and Brexit. He has served as a European defence adviser to the current Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Another of the deepening policies currently championed by both France and Germany concerns the formation of a proper European army. Once more the absence of the UK makes the prospect move from the impossible to the improbable. There is a sufficient crack opened for optimism to shine through so that it becomes a topic that can actually be broached in policy discussions not merely as a piety. For too long Brexit has been discussed in terms of how it enables and gives heart to Europe’s populists. But it will also enable the European establishment to return to an older agenda of deepening the Union with the moralising justification being that it’s the only way to protect European peace and democracy. Maltese pro-European democrats have their work cut out for them. Populism is gnawing away at democracy from within but the kind of federalism currently offered will suffocate it from outside. We need to think hard about what we need and look for plausible alliances. ranierfsadni@europe.com This is a Times of Malta print opinion piece Born that way can’t change - Frank Muscat We are what we eat - Godfrey Farrugia \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britons who have changed their minds since voting to leave the European Union in 2016 are among those uniting to call for another chance to reverse the decision. These \"Remainer now\" voters former Brexit supporters are adding their voices to the chorus of calls for a second referendum amid political paralysis in Britain over the issue. Gary Maylin 38 from Norwich in eastern England said he originally backed leaving the bloc after more than four decades of membership because he \"wanted sovereignty for the UK\". He recalled facing a barrage of pro-Brexit sentiment at the time which influenced his choice. \"My MP was (pro-)Leave all the arguments I heard were for Leave\" he told AFP. \"So I decided the EU was to blame for a lot of the things that were going wrong -- the inability of our government to control our destiny.\" Political turmoil The world\\'s fifth-largest economy is in political turmoil and grasping for solutions that could smooth its planned departure from the bloc just 10 weeks from now. British Prime Minister Theresa May is scrambling to put together a new Brexit strategy after MPs rejected her EU divorce deal but admitted Thursday that she can not rule out a potentially damaging \"no-deal\" split. Maylin was among 51.9% of voters to support leaving the bloc in the nationwide referendum two and-a-half years ago trumping the 48.1% who went for Remain. But he says he would now \"absolutely\" vote the other way. \"I\\'ve come to appreciate that we are not going to... succeed as a nation on our own\" Maylin explained adding \"walking away isn\\'t working for us\". \"We really benefit from being strong as a united Europe rather than independent as a country\" he said pointing to everything from US President Donald Trump to the continued rise of China. Calls for a second referendum Earlier this week Maylin joined a dozen or so other Brexit converts who headed to Westminster the epicentre of political power to tell British MPs why they now want another referendum. The meeting was organised by \"RemainerNow\" an initiative launched by a Europhile Andrew Davidson in his spare time with a presence online. Davidson was left \"disturbed\" by the 2016 result and spurred into action by meeting regretful Brexit voters. \"There was so many people both in my personal life but also I\\'ve seen on social media or TV that had regrets over their Leave vote\" he said. His movement is hopeful of seeing a second vote - repeatedly rejected by the government - as opinion polls show a majority would now support Remain. A recent compilation of surveys by the non-partisan organisation \"What UK Thinks: EU\" found 54 percent now favour staying in. Brexiteers have argued that such polls - which showed Leave would narrowly lose in 2016 - consistently ignores harder-to-reach Brexit supporters and are inaccurate. But people\\'s fears over the economic impact of leaving the bloc are real according to pollsters. \"If you voted Leave but you now think that the economy will suffer as a result your chances of voting leaving again come down to about 50 percent or so\" John Curtice one of Britain\\'s leading survey experts told AFP. \\'Promises were broken\\' Christopher Oram from the southwestern English county of Dorset is another former Brexit supporter who believes he was lulled into the wrong decision. \"We had the MPs who were saying that we could have our cake and eat it\" Oram said noting campaign promises of money saved easy trade deals and a prosperous future. \"Then I heard that we were going to leave the single market and custom unions so again I\\'m in shock\" added the 28-year-old. \"All the promises were broken.\" Those who have lost faith in Brexit revealed it had not been easy sharing news of their switch with friends and family who have stayed loyal to the cause. Maylin said he has been harassed on social media while Oram quarrelled with his best friend over the issue. \"He still thinks that we should be leaving so that causes a lot of tensions between myself and him\" he said. \"Our partners have now said that we\\'re not allowed to talk about Brexit over the dinner table any more.\" Other friends have shunned Oram in response. \"I find upsetting that people don\\'t accept... I have the right to change my mind\" he added. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

With Britain tearing its hair out over the Brexit confusion Scotland\\'s government is biding its time as it prepares for the ultimate prize - independence. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon a strong opponent of Brexit has said she will set out her thinking on independence plans later this month. The issue presents voters and leaders north of the border with another source of dispute something that this week\\'s decision to delay Britain\\'s departure from the European Union has done little to resolve. The government is \"absolutely committed to an independent Scotland in the European Union\" Scottish Minister for Europe Migration and International Development Ben Macpherson told AFP while out campaigning in Leith east of Edinburgh. But even independence backers are divided over Brexit -- five years on from Scotland\\'s own referendum in which 55 percent opted to remain a part of Britain. Retiree Phil enjoying the sunshine in a central Edinburgh park said he wanted \"complete independence\". Phil said Sturgeon\\'s Scottish National Party had \"done a lot of good but I don\\'t agree with them on Brexit\". He said he would even consider voting for Nigel Farage\\'s new Brexit Party -- much to the consternation of companion Lisa. \"I\\'m Scottish first then European\" she said. \\'Sick of all the Brexit\\'\\xa0 Some pro-EU voters who wanted to stay in the United Kingdom in the 2014 referendum are now in favour of independence but the issue risks pushing away those who want a clean break from both London and Brussels. Former SNP deputy leader Jim Fairlie said the government\\'s policy of independence within the EU was an \"oxymoron\" and that tying the two issues together meant \"they\\'re not going to get the votes of traditional nationalists like me.\" \"All the SNP has to do to keep the independence movement together is to decouple it from membership of the EU\" he added. But over 60 percent of Scots voted to stay in the EU and some are being won over to the independence cause. \"I know quite a lot of people... who voted to stay with the UK... who now say because they\\'re sick of all the Brexit they\\'ve changed their minds\" said local resident Mary Cryan amid the hubbub of Edinburgh\\'s Royal Mile in the shadow of the city\\'s centuries-old castle. The shifting blocs have largely cancelled themselves out so far with polling stuck at around 55 percent versus 45 percent in favour of staying in the United Kingdom according to polling expert John Curtice from the University of Strathclyde. But independence supporters think that the chaos in Westminster could shift the balance. \"It certainly makes the democratic case easier because it really does throw into stark relief this democratic deficit problem\" Kevin Pringle a former director of strategic communications for the SNP told AFP in his Edinburgh office. \\'Concentrate on the day job\\' Independence supporters still face a stiff challenge in winning over more conservative voters who wanted to stay in both the EU and the UK. \"The SNP should concentrate on the day job rather than looking at independence\" 50-year-old public servant Craig told AFP in the city\\'s Scots Guards Club as pipers and other folk musicians played in the background. Complicating the task for the SNP Brexit has become something of a moving target since the terms of the withdrawal and the date are far from certain. \"It\\'s a bit like a mirage in the desert\" Pringle said. Key to the calculations will be whether Britain will remain in the European customs union after Brexit or not which would take any volatile \"hard border\" debate out of a future independence campaign. Campaigners must also soon must also find a united position on a raft of economic issues including what currency an independent Scotland would adopt. Pringle added: \"It\\'s a challenge that can be achieved but I don\\'t think anybody underestimates the scale of it\".

Photo: Reuters  Stopping Brexit is possible but it’s complicated. I’m not arguing here that no Brexit is going to happen only that it is legally and practically possible and recent events render it slightly more likely. The only way Brexit can be stopped is if the Article 50 notification triggered in March 2017 to begin the UK’s departure from the EU is revoked. Under EU law once Article 50 is triggered the departing state automatically leaves the EU after two years unless Article 50 is extended. Unfortunately the short text of Article 50 doesn’t say whether the departing state can unilaterally revoke its notification to leave or whether the consent of the remaining EU member states is required. A case currently under consideration by the European Court of Justice (CJEU) will determine just that. On December 4 the advocate general Campos Sánchez-Bordona issued his opinion to the court arguing that Article 50 is unilaterally revocable. He argued that if the consent of the EU27 was required this could lead to the departing state being forced to leave the EU against its will which would be unacceptable. If the CJEU upholds this opinion in its final judgement due on December 10 – which is not guaranteed – the UK would be able to revoke Article 50 unilaterally provided it was acting in good faith. A revocation of Article 50 would have to be initiated by the UK. It’s anticipated that parliamentary approval via an act of parliament would also be required to revoke Article 50 although some constitutional lawyers disagree. Even if parliamentary approval was not legally required it’s difficult to imagine the government revoking Article 50 without parliament’s backing. The June 2016 referendum imposed no legal obligation on the government to implement the result. However the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 sets the date of Brexit as March 29 2019 in law. Crucially it also repeals the European Communities Act 1972 which is the legislation that brought the UK into the EU. This means that a change in UK law is also required to stop Brexit. So to stop Brexit Article 50 would need to be revoked and after that the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 must be repealed. Even if parliamentary approval is not required for the former it is for the latter. In the UK’s democracy parliament is sovereign and it would be entitled to try and stop Brexit if it wanted. Still it’s implausible to imagine this parliament or any future parliament trying to stop Brexit without some form of electoral mandate. A general election or second referendum could provide one. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 means that a general election is unlikely as it would require two-thirds of MPs to vote in favour of one. Alternatively a majority of MPs would need to vote in favour of a no-confidence motion against the government. If no new government can then be formed within 14 days a general election would be triggered. A second referendum is perhaps more likely. It would require primary legislation and therefore the support of a majority of MPs. A referendum could come about via an amendment to the “meaningful vote” on the withdrawal agreement on December 11 which makes approval of it or approval of the subsequent implementing legislation conditional on a referendum. A referendum could also emerge if MPs reject Theresa May’s deal. To avoid the UK leaving the EU without a deal – and if no better deal can be negotiated and win the support of parliament – MPs might then seek to force a second referendum to break the impasse.   Read more: What happens if parliament rejects a Brexit deal?   Dominic Grieve’s amendment passed on December 4 in a significant defeat for the government makes such a move easier. By law the government is required to produce a written statement to MPs outlining its plan within 21 days of the deal being rejected. MPs then vote on a motion on the basis of that statement. Grieve’s amendment now enables MPs to table amendments to this motion thereby giving them much more political control over what happens next if the deal is voted down. If at this stage a majority of MPs support a second referendum they could amend the motion to require one and it could be politically impossible for the government to ignore their will. A second referendum would require a minimum of 22 weeks to organise and hold. This means that Article 50 would need to be extended because there wouldn’t be enough time before the end of March 2019. It’s reasonable to assume that the EU would unanimously agree to an extension if it was for the purpose of a second referendum. The date of Brexit in UK law would also need to be amended but this should not be a problem if a majority of MPs have voted for a second referendum. The path to stopping Brexit is fraught with legal uncertainty and political controversy. Although it’s possible – and more likely now than a few days ago – it remains a highly uncertain prospect. May’s deal could pass perhaps in a second vote if the first ends in defeat. No deal still remains the default outcome and so cannot be ruled out. Crucially the UK will automatically leave the EU on March 29 2019 with or without a deal unless Article 50 is extended or revoked. Amid the uncertainty what’s clear is that stopping Brexit requires a majority in parliament to change the law force a second referendum or general election and revoke Article 50. It also requires a cooperative and patient EU to allow for an extension of Article 50 and potentially consent to its revocation. Finally it requires a willing public which is probably the biggest obstacle on the tumultuous path to stopping Brexit.

Photo: Amani A/Shutterstock.com  The situation surrounding the acceptance by the UK of the deal agreed with the EU last November remains chaotic. The positions of the two sides particularly with regard to the Irish border at present look unbridgeable and the continuing stand-off between Brussels and Westminster may lead to the UK’s leaving the EU without a deal come March 29. The increasing risk of a disorderly withdrawal prompted the EU to work on a Contingency Action Plan in order to mitigate the effects of a “no deal” Brexit and protect its citizens and businesses from the resulting drastic disruptions. In a “no deal” case there will be no transition period and EU law will cease to apply to and in the UK from March 30 2019.\\xa0 This “cliff edge” scenario will seriously affect citizens’ rights the flow of trade and investment air and road transport financial services energy efficiency maritime and fishing rights education technical standards and a myriad of other areas affecting our daily lives. Over the past year the European Commission published 88 sector-specific notices to inform stakeholders about the consequences of the UK’s withdrawal from the Union without an agreement. The Commission has so far made 18 legislative proposals which are intended to remedy the negative impacts of a “no deal” Brexit on citizens businesses and public administrations. The proposed measures are time-limited. They target specific areas and aim to mitigate the interruptions caused by the lack of a transition period. These EU unilateral measures also provide a breathing space for private and public administrations to make the necessary technical preparations. The latest of these measures published on January 30 2019 seek to protect the rights of young people participating in the Erasmus Plus programme and the social security rights of EU citizens. They concern two sections of our society which can least afford to lose the rights they enjoy while the UK is a member of the EU. The Erasmus Plus programme has been around for more than 30 years and is considered an EU flagship initiative. It is one of the most popular and successful EU actions among the younger generation of EU citizens. Since its inception it has given more than nine million young Europeans an opportunity for a learning mobility experience abroad through learning and training in another European country. It helps to create a new generation of people who identify themselves as European and share Europe’s common values.\\xa0 It is also a key instrument for reaching the target of a European Education Area by 2025. There are currently around 14000 young persons from the EU 27 following an Erasmus Plus programme in the UK and around 7000 UK learners in the EU 27. These include students trainees in higher and vocational education and educational staff. The Commission has so far made 18 legislative proposals which are intended to remedy the negative impacts of a “no deal” Brexit If the withdrawal agreement is not signed and no transition period would enter into effect on March 30 they would not be able to complete their Erasmus Plus term and may no longer be eligible for grants. Participants would have to interrupt their learning and training activities. The aim of this contingency measure is to guarantee that in the case of a “no deal” Brexit Erasmus students and trainees both from the EU 27 and from the UK would be able to complete their studies and continue to receive the relevant funding or grants. This would apply to ongoing activities which would have started before the date on which UK leaves the EU. Malta has one of the fastest growing rates of participation in the Erasmus programme. More than 3100 Maltese students trainees and educational staff take part in over 70 projects each year. The UK is by far the top receiving country for Maltese participants. The second contingency proposal published on January 30 2019 aims to safeguard the social security rights of EU citizens in case of a “no deal” Brexit. Throughout the Brexit negotiations the EU consistently insisted on the priority of protecting the rights of EU citizens in the UK and of UK citizens in the EU. Among these rights are the entitlements of those citizens who exercised their right of free movement before the date of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. The proposed contingency regulation ensures that member states would continue to apply the core principles of EU social security coordination namely the principles of equality of treatment assimilation and aggregation. The social security entitlements covered by the contingency measure includeperiods of insurance and self-employment or residence in the UK before the Brexit date. This means for example that the years worked in the UK by a national of the EU 27 before Brexit will be taken into account in the calculation of his/her pension rights by the competent authorities in the EU member state where he/she retires. To complete the picture it is relevant to mention that the UK government made an announcement on December 6 2018 on citizens’ rights in the event of a “no deal” Brexit. The UK government has taken steps to remove any ambiguity and provide complete reassurance for EU citizens in the UK. With regard to social security contributions the UK government said that it was exploring options to protect past social security contributions made in the EU and in the UK in the event of a “no deal” scenario. It is clear that social security coordination requires reciprocity. Developments both in the EU and in the UK indicate that there will be reciprocity with regard to social security entitlements even in a “no deal” scenario. It is important to mention that irrespective of Brexit thanks to the bilateral agreements on health and on social security signed between Malta and the UK the status of Maltese citizens resident in the UK and of UK citizens resident in Malta will remain largely unchanged as far as health and social security are concerned. Further reassurance has been given by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat in a statement lately in Parliament that is that Malta and the UK had agreed that after Brexit all bilateral arrangements between the two countries would remain in place.\\xa0 As Brexit Day is fast approaching and as matters currently stand a ‘no-deal’ scenario is still very possible even if highly undesirable given its potential disruption. Discussions between the sides must continue aimed at eventually agreeing a withdrawal agreement to ensure as much as possible a controlled Brexit for all businesses and individuals - and to allow time for the two sides to define out a permanent trading relationship. However it is similarly imperative that together with all our EU partners we also in parallel effectively prepare ourselves on all the affected fronts for a possible no-deal scenario always in the best interest of all our citizens not only in the immediate period post-March 29 but also in the months and years to come.

Photo: Reuters  Britain’s construction companies in September reported the sharpest fall in activity since just after June 2016’s Brexit vote as clients put projects on hold due to uncertainty over the economy. Although construction makes up just six per cent of Britain’s economy the survey suggested it was likely to drag on official third-quarter growth figures just as the Bank of England gets ready to raise interest rates. The IHS Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI) sank to 48.1 in September from August’s reading of 51.1 its lowest since July 2016 and far below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. Anything below 50 is considered a contraction. Sterling weakened by around a quarter of a cent against the dollar and fell to a day’s low against the euro after the data. The construction sector is entering its own recession “The construction sector is entering its own recession” Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said. “The government’s shift to a more accommodating stance in Brexit talks has done little to convince builders that clients will sanction delayed projects soon.” IHS Markit said the prospect that the BoE will raise rates next month for the first time in a decade was also a factor behind slower house building. Business investment overall has grown since the Brexit vote but many business leaders say the government is not making enough progress in Brexit talks with the European Union. Construction - which has long lead times for projects and relies heavilyon labour from the EU - has been particularly hurt. Official data last month showed construction orders fell more than 12 per cent year-on-year in the three months to June and the PMI has shown lower orders for the past three months. Expectations for the future were at their second-lowest level since 2013 yesterday’s survey also showed. However shares in housebuilders have gained in recent days after Britain’s ruling Conservative Party announced plans to revive a £10 billion house-building subsidy. The manufacturing PMI published on Monday showed a slowdown in growth although it remained solid and a survey of Britain’s huge services industry due today will give a clearer idea of third-quarter growth. “Following on from a softer manufacturing survey for September the weak construction survey fuels concern that an already lacklustre UK economy could be faltering” said Howard Archer chief economist at consultancy EY ITEM Club. Britain’s economy has suffered its weakest growth so far this year since 2012. Consumer demand has borne the brunt of a rise in inflation to its highest in nearly five years which is largely due to the pound’s tumble after the Brexit vote. The PMI data showed the cost of building supplies rose at its fastest rate in seven months in September. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The pound fell further ahead of a key Brexit summit in Brussels on yesterday while equities investors tried to come to grips with an unexpectedly dovish message from the US Federal Reserve. Sterling seen as a barometer for Britain\\'s long-running Brexit saga remained on the backfoot over fears that the country could crash out of the EU without a deal continued to fester. The London\\'s benchmark FTSE 100 index rose 0.5 per cent buoyed by news that official UK retail sales rose 0.4 per cent in February from the previous month. In eurozone early afternoon trade the Paris CAC 40 stocks index shed 0.2 per cent and Frankfurt\\'s DAX 40 slid 0.5 per cent as uncertainty prevailed ahead of the hotly-anticipated Brexit summit. British Prime Minister Theresa May was back in Brussels on a last-gasp mission to beg EU leaders for more time to deliver a Brexit deal that was twice rejected by her own parliament. May has declared that she is “determined” to deliver Brexit after formally requesting a three-month delay on Wednesday. However investor fears persist that the 27 other EU leaders could refuse the request potentially sending Britain crashing out of the bloc in just eight days\\' time. The pound fell as low as $1.3106 in midday trading. “If the European leaders decide that they need more time ‒ possibly a week ‒ to respond to May\\'s request then the pound will travel south towards the $1.30 support as uncertainty will again soar\" warned analyst Konstantinos Anthis at trading firm ADSS. The Bank of England (BoE) as expected held its main interest rate steady at 0.75 per cent. Sentiment on equities markets was hit after the Federal Reserve forecast overnight that it would not raise US borrowing costs this year ‒ a shift from an earlier projection of two hikes ‒ and cut its annual growth outlook. European markets were mostly down in afternoon trading and Wall Street opened lower. “US stocks are under some early morning pressure as the Fed unexpectedly reflected an easier policy stance yesterday and warned that too-low inflation is one of the major challenges of our time” said analysts at Charles Schwab brokerage.\\xa0 Investors were also spooked after US President Donald Trump dashed hopes on Wednesday for a quick resolution to the China-US trade talks by warning tariffs would stay in place for some time after any agreement is reached. Most stock markets in Asia rose with Shanghai 0.4 per cent higher while Singapore added 0.2 per cent Seoul climbed 0.4 per cent and Manila jumped 1.2 per cent. Sydney Taipei Bangkok and Jakarta also rose though Hong Kong reversed course in the afternoon to close 0.9 per cent lower. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

European leaders and British Prime Minister Theresa May opted to delay Brexit for up to six months saving the continent from a chaotic no-deal departure today. “The high drama of a Brussels summit between the 28 EU leaders that ran late into the night failed to cause a commensurate move in the markets” noted XTB analyst David Cheetham. The deal struck in the early hours of Thursday allows Britain until October 31 to ratify the divorce it had initially set for March 29 but leaves the door open for Brexit anytime before then. News of the delay allowed traders to breathe a sigh of relief but observers noted the reprieve was only brief with the agreement merely kicking the can down the road. If Britain has not ratified the divorce by May 22 it must hold elections to the European Parliament or crash out of the bloc on June 1 with no deal. “A second delay really has not surprised the markets” ETX Capital analyst Michael Baker told AFP. “The difference with this extension is that it contains the EU elections with the UK obliged to take part. If the UK has not agreed a compromise and does not hold elections then they are expected to leave with no agreement in place.” May remains under intense pressure from hardline Brexit supporters in her Conservative party not to compromise in talks with the opposition Labour party. Richard Falkenhall forex strategist at Swedish banking group SEB expressed doubts over a cross-party agreement. “The small reactions in the pound and in markets in general are understandable as the outcome of the EU-summit was widely anticipated” Falkenhall told AFP. He added: “Although it is a six-month extension we believe that May will try to reach an agreement with the Labour (party) soon enough to avoid British participation in the elections for the European Parliament although we doubt she will manage this.” British business yesterday gave a cautious welcome to the second Brexit extension - but also urged an end to the “chaos” that has plagued the nation's withdrawal from the EU. Wall Street edged higher at the opening helped by optimism about the economy after the government reported jobless claims data that came in lower than expected providing another reason for the US central bank to hold fire in interest rate hikes. “Further reports of progress in US-China negotiations” on trade also lifted sentiment analysts at Charles Schwab said. Earlier Asian equities mostly fell with few catalysts to drive buying and investors still on edge over trade frictions between the United States and Europe.

Photo: Reuters  Britons have voted to leave the European Union a decision which leaves the world\\'s fifth-biggest economy facing deep uncertainty about its growth prospects and its attractiveness to investors and which could hurt other economies in Europe and beyond. The vote is expected to deliver at least a short-term hit to growth in Britain and might push it into recession. It could prompt the Bank of England to cut interest rates to zero and test the willingness of creditors to keep on funding Britain\\'s current account deficit. Further ahead the implications of the vote will depend on what kind of trading relationship Britain can strike with the EU which accounts for nearly half the country\\'s exports. Below is a summary of the economic implications of the vote: ECONOMIC GROWTH * Britain\\'s economy would grow more slowly outside the EU than if it stayed in according to a raft of projections made in the run-up to the referendum by the government the Bank of England British research institutes international organisations and hundreds of academics. * Finance minister George Osborne has warned of a \"DIY recession\" and the BoE has said a \"material slowdown\" could result after a Brexit. Its governor Mark Carney has said the economy could go into a two-quarter contraction. Uncertainty about the future of Prime Minister David Cameron and finance minister George Osborne and the possibility of another independence referendum in Scotland could also weigh on economic growth. * A small group of pro-Brexit economists has said leaving the EU will boost growth in the years to come although at least one of them predicts a shallow downturn first. * The fall in sterling which on Friday hit its lowest level against the dollar since 1985 could help exporters - although demand in many countries around the world remains weak. * Below are estimates of the impact of Brexit on Britain\\'s gross domestic product compared with remaining in the EU. * The OECD and the IMF have said a Brexit will hurt the rest of the EU and affect other countries further afield. The OECD has said output in the EU not including Britain will be around 1 percent weaker by 2020 than otherwise if Britain left bloc a palpable hit for a region which is growing only weakly. * The OECD has said there could be deeper economic fallout if a Brexit undermines confidence in the future of the EU a scenario not included in its forecasts. * U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said last week the referendum could have consequences for the global economy and financial markets. \"If it does so it could have consequences in turn for the U.S. economic outlook that would be a factor in deciding on the appropriate path of policy\" she said. MONETARY POLICY * BoE Governor Carney has said it is too simple to assume the Bank will cut interest rates from what is already a record low of 0.5 percent to cushion the economy after a Brexit vote. The BoE says it would have to weigh up slower growth against higher inflation caused by a weakening of the pound. That means any decision to change interest rates might not take place for several weeks possibly not until August when the BoE is due to publish its latest detailed view on the economy. * Seventeen of 26 market economists polled by Reuters in April expected the BoE\\'s next move after an exit from the EU would be to cut rates rather than raise them. CURRENT ACCCOUNT * Britain racked up its biggest current account deficit on record last year equivalent to 5.2 percent of economic output. The shortfall reflected higher flows of dividends and debt payments to foreign investors than similar flows into the country as well as its wide trade deficit. Carney has said a Brexit could test the \"kindness of strangers\" who fund the balance of payments deficit. STERLING AND GILTS * Despite the risk premium already built into sterling analysts predicted before the referendum that the currency would fall further in the event of Brexit. Investors including bond fund PIMCO predicted the pound would hit a multi-decade low around $1.35. George Soros the billionaire who earned fame by betting against the pound in 1992 it could go as low as $1.15. It was trading around $1.33 early on Friday. * In bonds strategists think gilt yields could fall to new all-time lows of 1 percent and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield could drop as much as 30 basis points to around 1.35 percent which would also be a record low. JOBS * Most forecasters think Britain\\'s unemployment rate -- now at a 10-year low of 5.0 percent -- will rise after leaving the EU although after the financial crisis Britain managed to avoid job losses on the scale seen it other countries. * As seen after the crisis wages will probably bear the brunt of any post-Brexit slowdown according to the International Monetary Fund. Britain\\'s National Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank estimated real consumer wages will be between 2.2 percent and 7.0 percent lower in real terms by 2030 than if Britain had stayed in the EU. * By contrast Economists for Brexit has said Britain\\'s labour market could become more dynamic through the repeal of onerous EU regulation and the elimination of some of the EU\\'s highest import tariffs such as on food boosting productivity and living standards. But cutting back import tariffs could expose some sectors of the economy to fierce competition. TRADE * World leaders from the United States Japan Germany and France have warned Britain that leaving the EU would hurt its standing as a global trading power. * U.S. President Barack Obama said Britain would join \"the back of the queue\" for talks with the United States. This week French President Francois Hollande said leaving the EU would put at risk Britain\\'s access to the single market. * Pro-Brexit economists have dismissed the warnings as scaremongering and they say Britain could forge trade deals with the EU and countries beyond and could also cut import duties on its own if no deal was forthcoming. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

New Brexit Secretary David Davis indicated shortly before his appointment that the start of formal negotiations to leave the EU should be triggered by the start of next year with final withdrawal taking place around December 2018. Mr Davis said that Britain should take a \"brisk but measured\" approach to initiating the two-year process of thrashing out a new relationship with Brussels under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Before the Article is invoked \"serious consultation\" must take place with the devolved administrations in Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland as well as stakeholders in the City business organisations the TUC the National Farmers Union universities and research foundations he said. \"None of them should have any sort of veto but we should try to accommodate their concerns so long as it does not compromise the main aim\" wrote Mr Davis. \"This whole process should be completed to allow triggering of Article 50 before or by the beginning of next year.\" In the article published on the ConservativeHome website on July 11 Mr Davis said the ideal - and most likely - outcome of Article 50 negotiations would give the UK continued tariff-free access to the European single market while allowing it to impose new controls on migration. \"Once the European nations realise that we are not going to budge on control of our borders they will want to talk in their own interest\" he said. \"There may be some complexities about rules of origin and narrowly-based regulatory compliance for exports into the EU but that is all manageable.\" If EU nations sought to impose \"irrational\" tariffs on UK exports Britain could respond by using cash raised from levies on European imports to offer financial support to affected industries he suggested. \"Such a package would naturally be designed to favour British consumers and British industry\" said Mr Davis. \"Which of course is another reason that the EU will not force this outcome particularly if we publicise it heavily in a pre-negotiation White Paper.\" Mr Davis predicted that Brexit will deliver a \"more dynamic\" economy striking swift bilateral trade deals with countries around the world resulting in lower prices in the shops higher wages for the lowest-paid and controlled immigration. A \"high-intensity\" drive to negotiate free trade deals with the world\\'s biggest economies could allow the public to see some of the economic benefits of Brexit before the likely date for withdrawal from the EU around the end of 2018 he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

We were received by the President of Malta Guido de Marco at the Palace in Valetta. Prof. de Marco spoke to us about his wartime experience in Malta and also about Italy during the Risorgi\\xadmento the movement for national unity and about\\xa0Giuseppe\\xa0Mazzini who in 1831 founded the\\xa0‘Young Italy’ movement. By 1833 the movement had 60000 members and in 1834 Mazzini founded a new organisation called\\xa0‘Young Europe’.\\xa0“You” Prof. de Marco told us\\xa0“are Young Europe”. He concluded by saying what joy it gave him to see boys and girls from countries that were enemies in World War II working and playing together in peace and friendship. How ironic and sad that the present Prime Minister of Malta\\xa0Joseph Muscat should now be chairing the European Council of Ministers facing a United Kingdom leaving the European Union. Brexit is the worst decision the UK has taken in my lifetime. I participated in the ‘March for Europe’ in London on March 25 to celebrate 60 years since the signing of the Treaty of Rome. We also marched against Brexit and over 100000 people gathered in Parliament Square to hear a whole range of impressive speakers including Alastair Campbell Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron Labour MP David Lammy and former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. In 2020 there will be a general election in the UK. Hundreds of thousands of Conservative voters who supported ‘Remain’ in the referendum are likely to vote Liberal Democrat and there may well be as many if not more Liberal Democrat MP elected as there were in 2010. There would then be a second referendum on whether to accept the terms of leaving the European Union or to withdraw Article 50 and stay in the EU. Everyone thinks that Brexit is a done deal – it is not. There is very strong opposition to Britain leaving the European Union and this is likely to grow. The Conservative Party paid a £70000 fine to the Electoral Commission for failing to declare expenses properly in the 2015 general election. Two dozen Conservative MPs have been referred to the Crown Prosecution Service for exceeding the allowed expenses. If they are found guilty there could be a series of by-elections in very marginal seats which they may well lose. Given these considerations it would be very wise for the European Union to extend the timeframe for negotiations to the end of 2020 when the UK may well have another government with a much more positive attitude towards Europe.

Britain could enter into a recession if it leaves the European Union without a formal trade deal the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned last week. The IMF is of the view that economic growth will slow down irrespective of any deal Britain reached over trade and tariffs with the European bloc. The strongly-worded IMF report warned that a “more disruptive departure” in which Britain leaves the EU and trades only on the basis of World Trade Organisation rules (which would require negotiations with 63 different countries) could cause the British economy the fifth-largest in the world to go into recession as investment and trade flows stall in the months following a so-called ‘hard Brexit’ in March 2019. On the other hand the IMF is forecasting UK growth of 1.5 per cent this year and next if a broad Brexit agreement is reached. Meanwhile a report by the Office for National Statistics showed on Wednesday that UK inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) unexpectedly rose to the highest level in six months during August as it inched up to 2.7 per cent from 2.5 per cent in July. Economists had expected a CPI rate of 2.4 per cent. Wages are still rising faster than inflation with data last week showing that wages excluding bonuses grew by 2.9 per cent in the three months to July. Rising prices for recreational goods transport and clothing underpinned the August price increases. Month-on-month consumer prices climbed by 0.7 per cent faster than the 0.5 per cent forecasted by economists. Core inflation which excludes food energy alcoholic beverages and tobacco rose to 2.1 per cent in August from 1.9 per cent in July. Finally in the US a National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo monthly report showed that confidence among American homebuilders was unchanged in September indicating that the housing market may be stabilising after signs of a slowdown in recent months. The headline sentiment index was unchanged at 67 in September and bucked analysts’ estimates for a decline to 66. Last December confidence among new home builders peaked at 74 a 20-year high marking the complete reversal of a 13-year cycle that began in July 2005 with the peaking of the housing bubble and its subsequent bursting. This report was compiled by Bank of Valletta for general information purposes only. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Europe’s stock markets dipped lower yesterday as investors digested downbeat German economic data and fears continued over the looming threat of a no-deal Brexit. Frankfurt dropped 0.3 per cent as official figures showed that industrial orders in Germany fell back in December the latest sign of a slowdown in Europe's largest economy. The news also sent the European single currency down to $1.138 - the lowest level since January 25. London stocks meanwhile slipped by 0.1 per cent with online supermarket Ocado hit by a warehouse fire and lingering concerns over Britain leaving the European Union without a deal next month. Japanese car giant Toyota weighed in on the issue after slashing its net profit forecast saying there was no way to avoid a negative impact in the event of a no-deal Brexit. German statistics office Destatis said the country's factory orders were down by 1.6 per cent from the previous month. “European equities are on the back foot after a surprise drop in German factory orders this morning added to signs that the region’s strongest economy is struggling” Oanda analyst Dean Popplewell commented. “The euro has fallen to its lowest level outright in a fortnight on the news. December saw German factory orders decline at the fastest rate in six months helping pile further misery on a eurozone which is clearly struggling amid global trade woes” added IG analyst Joshua Mahony. “With Brexit uncertainty and US-led trade friction this decrease in factory orders highlights the weaker demand” often associated with significant upheaval and uncertainty. Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler added to the bad news reporting its worst year since 2015. France’s CAC 40 market was down 0.1 percent following French banking group BNP Paribas reporting a dip in profits. Wall Street opened slightly lower a day after US President Donald Trump’s annual State of the Union address. Mr Trump touched upon a number of issues including the China trade war North Korea the Russia investigation and healthcare. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said both sides in the US-China trade negotiations were working to reach an agreement by the March 1 deadline. He also said the US economy is “still very strong”. “The US economy continues to perform extremely well amid signs of a slowdown in Europe and other parts of the world” he said. In Asia Tokyo and Sydney shares rose in another holiday-thinned trading day with most of Asia off for the Lunar New Year. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

French wine makers may be \"selling like crazy\" to Britain as their clients stock up ahead of Brexit but they say the country\\'s looming departure from the European Union promises nothing but problems. A no-deal Brexit for the UK the second-largest importer of French wines and spirits could disrupt wine exports through long border delays import taxes decreased British demand and increased competition from non-EU markets.\\xa0 \"Transportation of wine in the case there\\'s no agreement after March 29 could be very difficult\" said Gavin Quinney who runs a vineyard near Bordeaux. Quinney bottled all of his wine six weeks early this year to ship six months\\' worth of stock to the UK before the Brexit deadline. \"We\\'re trying to send as much wine as possible to England\" he said. The introduction of new taxes on imports as well as the likelihood of an economic slowdown in the UK following a no-deal Brexit are also concerns. \"The effect on currency is more important than England\\'s exit\" said Jeremy Cukierman director of Kedge Wine and Spirits Academy in Bordeaux. \"If there is no agreement the pound will certainly depreciate and our wines will be less competitive.\" Another worry is the risk the UK will negotiate more favourable trade agreements with other wine-producing nations such as Australia South Africa Chile and Argentina at the expense of European exporters.\\xa0 \"The British like wine and they\\'re not going to stop drinking it overnight but with Brexit happening they might make substitutions regarding where they buy it\" said Pau Roca the managing director of the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) to AFP.\\xa0 Although the UK is supposed to leave the European Union on March 29 the terms of the historic divorce are still unclear. The overwhelming rejection of Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s draft withdrawal agreement on January 15 has heightened anxieties.\\xa0 \"We\\'re 43 days away from the fateful date and we still don\\'t know what will happen\" said Philippe Casteja CEO of Borie-Manoux which owns more than 10 estates in the Bordeaux region home to some of the most coveted wines in the world. Uncertain Outcome The United Kingdom is the second largest importer of French wines and spirits behind the United States having imported €1.3 billion of alcohol from France in 2018 according to figures released Wednesday by the Federation of Wine and Spirit Exporters of France.\\xa0 But pre-Brexit numbers are already disconcerting to some distributors. The total value of imports fell by 0.6 per cent in 2018 compared with 2017 and the overall volume of imports dropped 7.2 per cent for wine and 23.7 per cent for spirits. \\xa0 There is also concern among winemakers from other European countries such as Italy and Spain which along with France make up the three leading producers of wine and spirits in the world. \\xa0\\xa0 \"With 27 per cent of our sales in Great Britain it\\'s very important for us to continue to work with this country\" said Nazareno Vicenzi head of the Consortium Delle Venezie which promotes the export of wines from a region in northeast Italy particularly the well-known Pinot Grigio. Churchill\\'s favourite Despite the uncertainty Bordeaux winemakers are hopeful Brexit won\\'t sever a deep-rooted relationship with British importers which dates back to the mid-12th century when Bordeaux became an English territory following the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II.\\xa0 \"The English are pragmatic unemotional and the kings of business\" said Benoit Calvet a wine merchant in Bordeaux who is optimistic but still plans to send six months of stock to warehouses in the UK to avoid shortages. \"It will be a little uncomfortable at first but when it comes to business England will remain an essential trading partner.\" The spectre of Brexit has not upset European wine markets uniformly. \"We sold like crazy in Great Britain at the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019\" said Franco Cristoforietti president of the Verona Region Wine Consortium in Italy. \\xa0 Exports of prosecco an Italian sparkling wine rose in 2018 and surpassed 100 million bottles for the first time according to the Prosecco Consortium.\\xa0\\xa0 In a nod to its enduring relationship with British consumers the Federation\\xa0of Wine and Spirit Exporters of France served Pol Roger champagne after its annual press conference in Paris on Wednesday. \"Churchill\\'s favourite\" said Nicolas Ozanam managing director of the federation. \\nmore Careers »  \\n Mar 22nd 14:12  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said many differences remained with Britain that still needed sorting before talks can start on a trade deal and urged the British government to give details of its plans. Speaking at a news conference in Brussels Barnier called on the British government to revise its position on citizens' rights and the role the EU court will play after Brexit. Barnier also said he wanted progress on all three priority Brexit issues before talks could move on to future ties including a trade deal. Commenting on British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's quip on Tuesday (July 11) that the EU could 'whistle' for big payments from Britain as part of the Brexit deal Barnier told a news conference: 'I'm not hearing any whistling just the clock ticking.' \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

We kindly ask you to take a few minutes to read and understand them.   In less than a week we shall probably know whether the Brexit deal negotiated by Theresa May will be approved by the House of Commons. It looks unlikely that it will. But a great sense of foreboding surrounds that likely rejection. It would plunge the UK into uncharted territory. How could a people that prides itself on its pragmatism arrive at this point? One shorthand answer is this: the entire Brexit saga – from David Cameron’s promise to hold a referendum – has featured the unknown. In the beginning it was consistently underestimated and played its part with a vengeance. Now it is difficult to ignore because some of the features of the UK political system that have hitherto been prized are appearing as factors that prevent resolution. Let’s begin with the referendum promise. Cameron made it to survive one parliament but had to deliver in a future one. He assumed the composition of the parliament would make no substantial difference. He was wrong. He made the electoral promise when the unambiguously pro-European Liberal Democrats were at their electoral zenith and when Labour still campaigned on putting the UK at the heart of Europe. But he had to deliver when the Lib Dems had been almost wiped out of the House of Commons and when Labour was led by Jeremy Corbyn with his Eurosceptic past and at best an ambivalent pro-European in the present. That affected the non-Conservative votes that could be won. A referendum campaign is not run by political parties. The two referendums held in the UK within the previous five years – the one on the voting system and the other on Scottish independence – were misleading. Each cause was actually associated with one minor political party (the Lib Dems for the first the Scottish Nationalists for the other). But Brexit as an issue cut through the two major parties. Cameron underestimated the difference. He thought he could win by following the model of his electoral campaign a year previously. But he couldn’t follow the negative campaigning of his electoral campaign because it would have meant an assault on major Conservative politicians. Since Cameron expected to win he held back Remain’s fire thinking he had to preserve party unity for after the victory. Since the Brexiters expected to lose they attacked with less restraint aiming to lose by an honourable margin. But Corbyn’s lukewarm endorsement and refusal to campaign on the same platform as Cameron meant that crucial Labour votes that could have been won in a close referendum were not. The next set of unknowns followed after the referendum. A referendum is supposed to be an icon of deliberative democracy. But they are one-off decisions without that distinguishing mark of deliberation: second thoughts. Second thoughts were always likely with an issue like Brexit. The referendum may have been styled as an act of pure popular sovereignty but the decision taken was to begin negotiations with 27 other countries. What those countries would decide was up to them. The Leave campaign could only wager; it couldn’t know. The one thing that could have been known is that the EU simply couldn’t afford to grant a withdrawal deal that wasn’t obviously worse than membership. Withdrawal with similar benefits would mean the end of the EU. Labour is saying it could renegotiate the deal on more favourable terms. Perhaps. But that’s unknown So once a Remainer (admittedly a lukewarm one) was elected the new Prime Minister one thing\\xa0 was obvious. No deal that the new Prime Minister negotiated could satisfy the majority of parliamentarians – even if May had not called a general election and weakened her position in Parliament considerably. First there is the deal itself. Once it was obvious that the deal was inferior to the status quo (with compensation only imaginable if great international trade deals were negotiated some time in the future) Remainers and Leavers would both complain. The Leavers with some chutzpah would say that it was the lack of conviction of a former Remainer that was to blame for a weaker deal and not the logic of an objectively weak negotiating hand. Second the weakness of the Opposition leader himself – Corbyn’s problems with being seen as of prime ministerial material and with leading a divided party – weakened May. The weakness of her rival made challenges to her authority seem less serious. (For anyone wondering why Joseph Muscat given his extraordinary parliamentary majority and the Opposition’s weakness goes to such lengths to put money into his backbenchers’ pockets there’s your answer: the rock-solid majority makes him more vulnerable to challenges on particular issues.) Which brings us to the unknown today. How could a Parliament that is overwhelmingly against Brexit in terms of the personal opinions of its MPs still feel so indecisive before the available options? The reason lies in the imponderables present at both the level of policy and the level of electoral calculation. At the level of policy neither the Tories nor Labour have an easy decision. What is there to propose beside the deal on offer? There is no return to pre-Brexit – staying in the EU would probably cost the UK some of its hard-won opt-outs that in the past justified EU membership. Labour is saying it could renegotiate the deal on more favourable terms. Perhaps. But that’s unknown. And if Labour fails to deliver it will be punished harshly – because the only way in which Labour can get into a position to renegotiate is by winning a general election. Unlike a referendum a party can be held accountable for that. Electorally it’s hard to see how either of the two parties of government could embrace a Remain stance. The Brexit vote was not decided on party lines. The major factors were age (older voters favouring Brexit) and education (university education is a reliable predictor of a Remain vote). No party can adopt a Remain stance without severely endangering the loyalty of an important part of its core vote. The idea that sufficient voters would cross party political lines is very optimistic in the light of the 2017 general election results. Paradoxically sticking to a pro-Brexit position is electorally safer for the politicians. From a policy point of view they can say the policy was chosen by the people not by them. They deliver a worse deal but can claim democratic excellence. From an electoral point of view the first-past-the-post system (FPTP) favours big parties sticking together since smaller parties are significantly disadvantaged. The argument for FPTP versus proportional representation is that it produces more decisive governments. Here however it’s destined to keep producing governments that embrace Leavers and Remainers within them. So far it’s been a recipe for indecisive government. Nothing in previous experience has prepared the current generation of UK politicians for this: a policy for which no political party as such is to blame; in a system where it is blasphemy to blame the people; in a Parliament made up of an overwhelming majority who believe the defining policy of the age is folly; but also uneasily aware that class inequality often makes an MP unrepresentative of the people he or she is supposed to represent; in an electoral system that does not permit politicians to coalesce in new ways to match the emerging divisions in the country. No wonder the future is imponderable. Would a second referendum resolve matters? Not according to the current polls. ranierfsadni@europe.com This is a Times of Malta print opinion piece \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Malta may be one of the big losers from Brexit if this leads to poor economic relations between the UK and the EU new research by KPMG suggests.\\xa0 KPMG’s chief economist Yael Selfin looked at the EU27 countries most impacted from any future restrictions on trade in goods services and the movement of labour.\\xa0 The research shows that nearly all of the EU27 have important links to the UK with countries like Ireland Cyprus Malta and Luxembourg potentially with the most at stake” Ms Selfin said. The Brexit impact on Malta ranks high for goods and services exported to the UK and Maltese residents living in Britain. KPMG said Brexit would have medium impact on British citizens living in Malta since the island needed the foreign workforce. The study published last month but only released by KPMG UK this week shows that Malta was the third most exposed country to the UK for exporting goods making it vulnerable to any trade barriers.\\xa0 Although the figures are insignificant for the British economy export of goods to the UK are worth nine per cent of Malta’s GDP.\\xa0 Ireland and Luxembourg were the most exposed to the British economy with the value of exports to the UK making up 14 per cent and 10 per cent of domestic GDP respectively.\\xa0 The research also shows that Malta was the second most exposed after Cyprus to the British economy for the export of services. These account for 6.4 per cent of GDP.\\xa0 Ms Selfin said the analysis shows how different EU countries might be approaching Brexit negotiations as they draw their own red lines. British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to trigger Article 50 of the EU Treaty to start exit talks by the end of this month.\\xa0 While there is widespread agreement among EU27 that the four freedoms underpinning the single market – free movement of goods services capital and people – should not be considered separately in any talks with Britain there is a lack of consensus on what the deal should be.\\xa0 The KPMG study shows that the EU’s largest economies – Germany France and Italy – face some risks to their exports of goods while for Spain curtailing the inflow of holidaymakers may prove undesirable.\\xa0 KPMG did concede that the effect on domestic economies of migration as a result of Brexit “may be ambiguous”.\\xa0 While Poles form the largest community of EU nationals resident in the UK amounting to 700000 they only account for just 1.8 per cent of Poland’s population. On the flip side the number of Maltese residents in the United Kingdom make up 7.6 per cent of Malta’s population.\\xa0 KPMG said that for many Eastern European countries protecting the workers in the UK and their remittances may be the most important priority during Brexit negotiations. \\xa0 Ms Selfin said with all 27 countries needing to approve any deal which must also be accepted by the UK it still had to be seen whether a mutually agreeable position could be reached within two years.\\xa0 “Collectively the EU has a lot to lose from a breakdown in economic relationships with the UK and if it can work together towards a solution based on economic facts rather than domestic politics many of the potential negative consequences of Brexit may be averted” the study concluded. Amended 10.05am - A previous version of this article mistakenly referred to Yael Selfin as 'Mr' rather than 'Ms'.\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

I have been watching with a morbid fascination as the political porn of the British government’s crumbling resolve and direction in delivering Brexit is played out on the 24-hour news cycle. Two things stand out in the mounting chaos. Firstly Brexit promises have proven to be about as real as the unicorn on the UK’s coat of arms. There was no real ‘Leave’ plan beyond politicians’ ego xenophobic prejudice economic jingoism and imperial nostalgia. Eager expectations of quick-fix trade arrangements with the ex-colonies were as unrealistic as they were vague. Businesses are leaving the City is under siege and EU nationals working in the UK are still completely in the dark. In its misguided reliance on its links with the ex-colonies its obdurate insistence to keep the Northern Ireland time bomb to its chest and its cavalier attitude towards the rest of Europe Brexit can be seen as the final exquisite torture that the UK is being made to pay as penance for its imperial past. But there is a second possibly more important point to Brexit. As Theresa May’s government gradually lost the plot and its authority in the Westminster Parliament I could not but admire the way the process of UK parliamentary democracy was standing up to the stresses of chaotic governance. The government’s highest legal authority and a senior cabinet minister twice had to give a legal opinion on Brexit that was not servile to the government in which he served but looked to the best interests of the nation. Speaker John Bercow previously a member of the Conservative Party in power has made rulings that strengthened the authority and prestige of Parliament in inverse proportion to the government’s.\\xa0 When May a few days ago all but accused Parliament of going against the will of the people both sides rose to rebuke her attack on the sovereignty of Parliament. Brexit is in a bloody mess but the UK parliamentary system of checks and balances is in fine fettle. Can you imagine Malta’s Speaker Anġlu Farrugia taking the kind of stand that his UK counterpart has? Or any Maltese Justice Minister or indeed any Member of Parliament of a party in government rising to defend the integrity and authority of Malta’s Parliament against his or her own government? For the second year running Ornis the ‘independent’ committee that ‘recommends’ to government the dates for Malta’s infamous hunting seasons decided in its infinite wisdom to allow the spring hunting season for quail. This in spite of the fact that a detailed analysis in February 2018 by Birdlife Malta showed that this spring hunting season was against EU regulations. It gets worse. Ornis did not align the spring hunting season with the peak migration of quail. Instead it conveniently moved the dates to fit the peak migration of another species of bird the turtle dove of which hunting is illegal. Brexit is in a bloody mess but the UK parliamentary system of checks and balances is in fine fettle As we would say in Maltese: “X’kumbinazzjoni!” But the Federazzjoni Kaċċaturi Nassaba Konservazzjonisti ever mindful of the sterling reputation of its community as a law-abiding bunch has already taken matters in hand to make sure that no luckless turtle dove will be mistaken for a quail. It plans to print flashcards of quail and turtle dove for the education of its members. Each hunter will have to be flanked by a man with binoculars feverishly scanning the skies and matching the incoming specks to the flashcards to check whether they the specks are shootable or not. Hikers of the Maltese countryside will be regaled with the noble cries of “Le mhix dik le…ħaqq mhux dik għedtlek!” resounding over the garigue. Finally hunters will be obliged to give a donation to charity for Lent for every turtle dove they shoot down by accident. So it’s all fixed.\\xa0 A word of explanation to the befuddled foreigners: no it’s not madness. It’s ‘best of times’ Malta. For Lord Of The Ring fans (and I mean the diehard ones who like me actually read the books before they saw the films) New Zealand is the land of Hobbits Elves and Numenorians both Lothlórien and Mordor.\\xa0 Today it may seem to be more of the latter than the former for the massacre of 50 Muslim worshippers at Christchurch a few days ago reeks of pure evil. It is the same evil that inhabits all lethal fanaticism irrespective of its political or religious justification. The butcher of Christchurch has much more in common with Isis than with anyone trying to live a Christian or Muslim faith in peace with their neighbours. Yet as the full scale of the rent in the fabric of New Zealand society was revealed it called forth this magisterial response from Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern: “They (the dead and wounded) were ours. They are us.” With these words she sought to avert political gangrene. But these words also countered the mad logic of sectarian hate with the balm of community. She has since matched her words with concrete action. In so doing Prime Minister Ardern has set the international standard for the moral imperative of governance in a multi-cultural world. Our Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has angrily rejected the link the butcher of Christchurch made with Malta’s Great Siege of 1565. “Malta has become a symbol of peace and equality and we welcome everyone here” he said. It was entirely right and proper for him to say so. If only it were true.

Gerry Adams He claimed fundamental human rights enshrined in the 1998 accord to end violence could be undermined. The top legal adviser to Stormont ministers has said not one word in the agreement would be affected. The Sinn Fein president said Northern Ireland should enjoy special status within the union of 27 states after Brexit and claimed that would not affect the constitutional settlement which secures its status as part of the UK. He said: \"Taking the North out of the EU will. It will destroy the Good Friday Agreement.\" The Dail TD (member of the Irish parliament) addressed a conference on achieving a united Ireland in Dublin. Mr Adams added: \"The British government\\'s intention to take the North out of the EU despite the wish of the people there to remain is a hostile action. \"Not just because of the implications of a hard border on this island but also because of its negative impact on the Good Friday Agreement. \"The British Prime Minister repeated her intention to bring an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court. \"Along with her commitment to remove Britain from the European Convention on Human Rights this stand threatens to undermine the fundamental human rights elements of the Good Friday Agreement.\" He claimed ending partition between Northern Ireland and the Republic had taken on a new importance. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU referendum by a majority of 56% to 44% \"As the dire economic implications of Brexit take shape there is an opportunity to promote a new agreed Ireland.\" Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU referendum by a majority of 56% to 44%. Mr Adams added: \"The speech by Theresa May will have reinforced this. The dangers of a hard Brexit are now more obvious than before. The North needs a special designated status within the EU. The Irish government needs to adopt this as a strategic objective in its negotiations within the EU 27 as they negotiate with the British Prime Minister.\" He claimed there was alarmingly no strategic plan from Dublin ministers. The Irish Government has already convened an all-Ireland forum on Brexit and agreed with the Prime Minister that there should be no return to the borders of the past for Northern Ireland. Its priorities remain its economic and trading arrangements the peace process and border issues as well as the common travel area. Mr Adams added: \"The British position also fails to take account of the fact that citizens in the North under the Agreement have a right to Irish citizenship and therefore EU citizenship.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  While Britain tries to get its house in order after the Brexit vote politicians in Europe grapple with the political and economic fallout. Brexit has conditioned the discourse across Europe for the past week and as what happens in every crisis the EU has faced the issue comes with its own catchphrases. Today the G in Grexit has been replaced with a B and ‘bailout’ has been replaced with ‘breathing space’ Only a year ago the headlines were dominated by ‘Grexit’ ‘insolvent’ ‘bailout’ and ‘haircut’ – words reminiscent of the saga that saw Greece turn to its European counterparts with a begging bowl as the country tottered on the brink of financial collapse and EU exit. Today the G in Grexit has been replaced with a B and ‘bailout’ has been replaced with ‘breathing space’ in the wake of the single largest shock the European project has had to face. Here are some of the catchphrases: • ‘Strong relationship’ is the vague terminology currently used to describe the nebulous arrangement a future British prime minister will seek with the EU once it decides on the way forward. • ‘No cherry-picking’ is the condition member states have made which could see Britain having to accept free movement of people if it wants full access to the single market. • ‘EU-27’ has made it to the lexicon as member states prepare for a union without Britain. • ‘Trade deal’ is what Britain wants and what remains undefined for the time being while the political class sorts itself out. This is accompanied by the phrases ‘Canadian model’ ‘Norwegian model’ and others to describe the options that exist today. • ‘Breathing space’ is the two- or three-month period EU leaders have given the UK until the internal political situation is sorted out and a new prime minister is appointed to replace David Cameron. • ‘Article 50’ is the exit clause in the Lisbon Treaty that Cameron’s successor will have to invoke before any formal talks with the EU can start. • ‘More Europe’ is the response to Brexit posited by the Brussels elite including European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker which hankers for greater integration in a post-Britain union. • ‘Better Europe’ is the other type of response to Brexit posited by some EU leaders including Joseph Muscat who argue for greater flexibility and against a one-size-fits-all mentality. ‘Nicola Sturgeon’ is the Scottish first minister who is likely to call a second independence referendum for Scotland but whose name remains problematic in EU circles because the bloc cannot be seen to urge secessionist feelings out of fear of sparking similar calls for secession in other member states like Spain. ‘Strong relationship’: the nebulous arrangement a future UK prime minister will seek with the EU once it decides on the way forward. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

I read with interest the letter by Peter Apap Bologna (‘Brexiteers were greatly misled’ The Sunday Times of Malta April 16). Clearly in his opinion everyone who voted for Brexit is suffering from “post-imperial nostalgia xenophobia and sheer misinformation”. I am writing as a Briton who has had the privilege to live in Malta for over 12 years. My letter is not an anti-EU statement merely a gentle explanation why many people took the opportunity to vote for Brexit. No we are not all Little England types suffering from delusions of imperial grandeur.\\xa0No one would argue that Malta has not gained tremendously by joining the EU but that is hardly a substantive argument as to why one size fits all.\\xa0I fully accept that many millions of people tragically died in the two World Wars but it is hysterical to suggest that the UK leaving the EU somehow plunges Europe into a potential World War III. There is no reason at all why with genuine goodwill all the gains made in Europe-wide co-operation cannot continue. Let’s put the rhetoric hysteria and perceived hurt feelings to one side they have no place in a mature debate or rather they shouldn’t have.\\xa0The UK is not alone in having concerns about the EU.\\xa0A quiet look at the workings of the EU over the past 40 years is quite thought provoking. Has the EU been able to apply good financial management and accountability? Not since inception has it been able to balance the books or produce audited accounts. Has the wealth of the EU been evenly spread and distributed to Member States particularly in the eurozone? Has the EU set an example of financial prudence? Just look at the continuing waste of excessive millions (if not billions) of euros as a result of having two locations for the European Parliament Brussels and Strasbourg. Are salaries and financial perks to EU employees in line with individual Member States?\\xa0No they are ludicrously high a disgraceful gravy train. Has the EU managed its migrant policy in a co-ordinated and unified way? Germany acted alone to throw the whole of Europe into permanent chaos.\\xa0\\xa0The EU collectively has been frighteningly unable to get a grip of things. Finally is the EU bureaucracy in any way responding to Europe-wide criticism? I would suggest not. I personally voted for the UK to join the original Common Market some 40 years ago.\\xa0What a wonderful ideal that was but we cannot turn the clock back.\\xa0I voted for Brexit for many reasons including all the reasons already mentioned and in the knowledge that with 27 other members the chance of major reform is just not going to happen. Alright so for the UK the system is just not working.\\xa0Why all the hostility? Lobbing insults is hardly a sign of maturity and acting in the best interest of Member States. Can we not stop the unpleasantness? It is unproductive and reflects badly on the parties involved.\\xa0Every threat is an opportunity and it would be wise for negotiators on both sides to build for the future rather than seeking retribution and demanding terms that are detrimental to the other party.\\xa0A smile and a warm handshake will achieve far more than a scowl and criticism.

Britain risks crashing out of the European Union without a Brexit deal \"by accident\" because London cannot decide what it wants a senior EU negotiator warned Monday. In some of her toughest remarks to date Sabine Weyand deputy to EU Brexit pointman Michel Barnier criticised Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s handling of divorce talks. \"There is\\xa0a very real risk of crash out. Not by design but by accident\" Weyand told an expert audience invited by the European Policy Centre think tank. Weyand complained that May had kept her own cabinet and MPs in the dark during 18 months of intense negotiations. As a result she argued many Westminster lawmakers were surprised by the content of the withdrawal deal May signed with EU leaders in November -- and rejected it. May is now seeking tweaks to the accord and to a parallel political declaration on future EU-British relations in the hope of belatedly winning domestic support. But the prospect of Brexit Day March 29 coming round without an agreement is becoming ever more likely.\\xa0 \"The crash out is the only scenario that does not require anyone to take any action or any decisions and that is why the risk of a crash out is so high\" Weyand said. On Tuesday British MPs will vote on a raft of amendments that could end up forcing May to either seek a delay in the Brexit date or a revising withdrawal agreement. - \\'Groundhog day\\' -But Weyand warned that negotiations are over and that this would not have been a surprise if May had kept her sceptical cabinet up to date on the state of talks. \"There are now ideas floating around again and it does feel like Groundhog Day about a time limit to the backstop or a unilateral exit clause\" she said. \"Let me just reassure you: None of this is new.\" May is expected back in Brussels to ask that the so-called \"Irish backstop\" meant to guarantee no return of a border in Ireland be stripped from the deal. Weyand said this had been rejected by all 27 EU leaders: \"This negotiation is in London. There\\'s no negotiation between the EU and the UK. That negotiation is finished. We are not going to reopen the withdrawal agreement.\" Weyand praised May for accepting \"ownership\" of the deal but warned she had lost her cabinet and party\\'s support: \"You cannot lead a negotiation like that in secrecy.\\xa0 \"On the UK side the fact this was handled within a very small circle and there was no information about all the things that were tried in the negotiations is now a big handicap.\"\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 22nd 14:12  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

London’s stock market rose as the pound fell yesterday with investors reacting to Brexit-facing data and Bank of England contingency measures ahead of fresh divorce-deal talks in Brussels. London’s FTSE 100 was up 0.2 per cent in afternoon trading helped by a drop in the pound that lifted share prices of multinationals listed on the benchmark index. Eurozone indices steadied while most Asian stocks closed lower. The pound retreated as hiring by companies dropped at the fastest pace in seven years amid Brexit uncertainty though other data showed output in Britain’s key services sector increased slightly in February. The Markit/CIPS services survey rebounded to 51.3 in February from a 29-month low of 50.1 in January. Meanwhile the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier met Britain’s negotiating team as both sides seek a breakthrough with just weeks to go before this month’s looming divorce deadline. The Bank of England warned that Europe’s financial system faced “potential risks” to its stability from a no-deal Brexit as it extended weekly lending facilities to include euros. The BoE warned that some disruption to cross-border services is possible and in the absence of other actions by EU authorities some potential risks to financial stability remain. Earlier in the day most Asian stock markets retreated as investors awaited fresh developments in the China-US trade talks though Shanghai closed higher as China unveiled massive tax cuts to support the stuttering economy. Wall Street provided a negative lead on Monday as optimism that the world's top two economies were heading for a tariffs deal was replaced by a need for clarity on any agreement. Shares have enjoyed a blockbuster start to the year but “trade optimism could only take the stock market so far” said Oanda senior market analyst Alfonso Esparza. Tokyo ended 0.4 per cent lower Sydney eased 0.3 per cent Singapore and Seoul were each 0.5 per cent off and Taipei dropped 0.4 per cent. Manila and Bangkok were also down. But Shanghai jumped 0.9 per cent while Hong Kong inched up after China announced hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tax cuts for firms to stimulate the economy. Beijing will also increase spending with the targeted fiscal deficit set to increase to 2.8 per cent of GDP from 2.6 per cent last year while the National People’s Congress is expected to pass laws next week regulating foreign investment in a move that could help ease US trade tensions. However it did reveal a target of 6.0-6.5 per cent growth for this year ‒ below the last year’s 6.6 per cent the slowest for three decades ‒ as Chinese leaders struggle to address a mounting debt crisis as well as the trade row. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Around 10000 finance jobs will be shifted out of Britain or created overseas in the next few years if the UK is denied access to Europe’s single market according to a Reuters survey of firms employing the bulk of workers in international finance. Frankfurt was by far the most popular destination for the new roles the survey showed with Paris a distant second. The results from 123 firms came from the first comprehensive public survey to ask the biggest banks insurers asset managers private equity firms and exchanges in Britain about the specific details of their plans so far in case of a so-called “hard” Brexit. Canvassing was conducted by e-mail and telephone interviews between August 21 and September 15 weeks after companies submitted detailed plans on their Brexit preparations to the Bank of England as required on July 14. The bank declined to comment on the results of that survey. Nearly half of the companies surveyed told Reuters they would have to move staff or restructure their businesses because of Brexit which is due to take place in March 2019. Another third said it would have no impact and the remainder said they were still deciding on their plans or declined to comment. The number of jobs to be moved or created overseas was based on answers from 39 companies employing at least 350000 people. About 1.1 million people work in Britain’s financial sector. The findings suggest that the first wave of job losses from Brexit may be at the lower end of estimates by industry lobby groups and firms which could mean London will keep its place as the continent’s top finance centre at least in the short term. Most respondents said bigger moves could be in store in a decade or more however. “If it is going to happen it won’t be in one big bang” said a senior executive at one of Europe’s largest banks which took part in the survey. “There will be a slow drain of jobs from London over a number of years.” The survey also suggests some financial institutions may be delaying decisions hoping a soft Brexit can be negotiated in talks currently going on in Brussels. BoE governor Mark Carney has specifically warned companies against that approach saying it’s important to start planning now. “They would like to think there is going to be a mutually easy way of dealing with financial services across the EU-UK border” said Andrew Gray global head of Brexit for financial services at PwC. “So firms are finding it hard to land on precise plans.” London’s future as Europe’s premier financial hub is one of the biggest issues in Brexit talks because the sector is the UK’s biggest source of corporate tax revenue. For its survey Reuters ap\\xadproached 158 of the largest and most internationally focused financial firms in Britain and received responses from all but 35. Those included the 20 investment banks that earned the most fees from investment banking in Europe the Middle East and Africa in 2016 according to Thomson Reuters’ data. Many participants gave only partial answers to the survey questions however and some asked not to be named and for their data to be used only in aggregate. The number of workers employed by the 75 organisations who provided their staffing numbers added up to 484578 the bulk of employees in the internationally focused financial sector. The 39 who gave information on their Brexit staffing plans included many of the companies most likely to be affected by losing the EU financial “passport” mechanism because London is their base to sell services across the EU. US and British banks would see the biggest impact because many use London as their EU investment banking base The survey indicated 9777 banking roles would be affected. Many of those would be shifted out of the UK but some would be new roles in Europe resulting in a period of duplication the executives surveyed said. Insurance companies said they planned to move or create about 98 jobs overseas and the asset management sector 311 roles the survey showed. US and British banks would see the biggest impact because many use London as their EU investment banking base which has increased in importance since the 2008 global financial crisis when banks tried to simplify their international structures into a few main hubs. The impact on Spanish Italian and Dutch banks was muted because they do not use London as a hub and have less of a focus on investment banking the survey showed. Japanese lenders such as Nomura Daiwa Securities and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group plan to set up subsidiaries in Frankfurt according to the survey. One said it planned to move about 100 jobs but asked not to be identified. Bank of America and Credit Suisse two of the biggest investment banks in London declined to say how many jobs would be affected. But BofA did say it would pick Dublin as its EU hub if there was a hard Brexit. Most in the financial industry picked Frankfurt as their preferred place to put jobs with 5470 roles most of which are the up to 4000 anticipated moves from Deutsche Bank. Paris came second with 1800 roles of which 1000 were planned by HSBC. The true impact of Brexit will only become clear in one or two decades because most firms are implementing a two-stage contingency plan senior executives in London said. The first phase will involve relatively small numbers to make sure the requisite licences and infrastructure are in place. The next will require longer-term thinking about what the companies’ European business will look like. The final impact will also depend on the details of the Brexit deal Europe’s economic growth and whether Frankfurt and Dublin prove to be successful alternatives to London. Previous forecasts for jobs losses in a hard Brexit scenario have ranged from about 30000 jobs estimated by the Brussels-based Bruegel research group in February to up to 75000 by Oliver Wyman in October and as many as 232000 by London Stock Exchange chief executive Xavier Rolet in January. The Bruegel estimate was for a three-year period starting from when divorce proceedings were formally triggered in March according to Dirk Schoenmaker an author of the report. The Oliver Wyman forecast is up to 2022. The London Stock Exchange forecast is up to 2024. Some politicians financiers and academics say bankers have exaggerated the threat to the economy from Brexit. “Brexit presents an inconvenience to their operations but also an opportunity to wrangle tax and rule changes to stay” according to Robert Jenkins a professor at London Business School and a former Bank of England policymaker. “They will play this for all its worth.” Several banks have heavily scaled back their estimates compared with a year ago. JPMorgan for example is currently planning to move fewer than 1000 roles whereas before the Brexit referendum the bank had said about 4000 jobs might be at risk. Paul Venables the finance director of Hays the largest recruiter for financial services in the City said the job market for financial services in London is gradually improving. “Where there’s been a lot of public pronouncements from the banks we’ve seen very little action we’re not seeing a large number of jobs go outside of the UK to Europe” he said. “We’re beginning to see tentative signs of that market returning to normalcy.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Britain’s high streets are heaving with shoppers despite June’s shock vote to leave the EU. Big companies have reported few signs of distress. The overwhelming view from economists is that it is too early to know how Britain will cope with years of Brexit uncertainty – but there is a growing belief the country can avoid a recession that only weeks ago was regarded as likely. On the face of it the optimism contrasts with ex-prime minister David Cameron’s pre-referendum warning that a Brexit vote would put a “bomb under the economy”. Retail sales in August reversed much of an immediate post-Brexit vote fall with retailers reporting their strongest sales in six months industry data showed last Thursday partly due to a weaker pound attracting overseas buyers. Official figures out last week showed the number of people claiming unemployment benefit fell unexpectedly in July. Before the June 23 referendum the Treasury warned that a Brexit vote would mean higher borrowing costs for homeowners pushing the economy into a “DIY recession” and that equity prices were likely to fall.\\xa0 But nearly half of mortgage borrowers look set to gain from the Bank of England’s August 4 interest rate cut and British equity markets are up. The British have become poorer than they were before the votes were counted on June 23 and that reality will become clearer as the months go by Most economists caution these positive signals may have little bearing on the long-term outlook for the economy which must contend with years of uncertainty as Britain extricates itself from the EU. New British Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will not trigger the EU’s Article 50 this year to begin formal talks with the bloc to negotiate the terms of Britain’s exit from the EU and its future trading relationship with the bloc. “The fact that the UK avoided an immediate crisis does not tell us much about the future” said Holger Schmieding chief economist at Berenberg Bank adding that Britain would probably avoid a technical recession – two consecutive quarters of falling economic output. Business surveys and some forward-looking indicators of inflation already offer reasons for caution. Price pressures in factories – which feed through into consumer prices – shot higher after the pound’s post-referendum plunge posing a threat to consumers’ future spending po\\xadwer. Market research firm GfK’s gauge of consumer confidence also fell sharply after the vote. The survey often predicts changes in household spending in the following quarters. The outlook for the housing market the bedrock of British consumer wealth is also unclear: a Reuters poll last Thursday suggested the Brexit vote will have a negative impact on both prices and turnover. While the mood among economists remains one of concern it has brightened across financial markets. Investors were braced for a global economic shock after the Brexit vote but the FTSE 100 index of UK blue-chip companies is up about eight per cent since the referendum helped by overseas earnings that will benefit from the pound’s fall in the value. The more domestically focused FTSE 250 index of mid-sized companies is up by about five per cent. Many big companies have reported little immediate impact from the vote in Britain including retailers John Lewis and Next the world’s biggest staffing company Adecco and carmaker BMW. Some major employers like carmaker Nissan say their plans for investment in Britain will hinge on the trade deals it strikes with other countries. The pound’s fall since the referendum – it was down almost 15 per cent at one point versus the dollar – has benefited some companies; it has boosted manufacturers’ exports for example. But it also reflects the weaker outlook for the economy. “In essence the currency markets are saying that all UK assets are worth less than they used to be” Rupert Pennant-Lea a former BoE deputy governor wrote in the Financial Times. “The British have become poorer than they were before the votes were counted on June 23 and that reality will become clearer as the months go by.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 22nd 14:12  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

European leaders agreed with Britain on Thursday to delay Brexit by up to six months saving the continent from what could have been a chaotic no-deal departure at the end of the week. The deal struck during late night talks in Brussels means that if London remains in the EU after May 22 British voters will have to take part in European elections. Prime Minister Theresa May and the other 27 EU leaders \"have agreed a flexible extension until 31 October\" European Council president Donald Tusk said in a tweet.\\xa0 \"This means additional six months for the UK to find the best possible solution.\" Prime Minister May said Thursday that Britain might still manage to execute an orderly departure from the European Union by May 22 despite winning the six-month reprieve from EU leaders. \"What this extension enables us to do is to go through the process we\\'ve set up\" May said. \"If we\\'re able to do that before May 22 then we won\\'t have to hold European Parliamentary Elections.\" A #Brexit extension until 31 October is sensible since it gives time to UK to finally choose its way. The review in June will allow #EUCO to take stock of the situation -JM France\\'s President Emmanuel Macron was the strongest voice opposing a long extension but most leaders backed it and the French had to settle for a promise that the delay will be reviewed at an EU summit on June 21. Most of the leaders gathered for the emergency summit including German Chancellor Angela Merkel had backed a plan for Brexit to be postponed for up to a year. But as the talks went into Thursday morning Macron -- with backing from Belgium Austria and some smaller EU states -- held out for a short delay of only a few weeks and demanded solid guarantees that London would not interfere in EU business during that time. May has already said that if Britain is still an EU member when the European parliamentary election begins on May 23 UK voters will take part. But some EU leaders are unconvinced that she is sincere despite one official telling reporters her presentation had been \"solid\". Without a postponement Britain would have ended its 46-year membership of the EU at midnight on Friday with no deal risking economic chaos on both sides of the Channel.\\xa0 May agreed on a divorce deal with the EU last November but MPs in London have rejected it three times forcing her to turn to the main opposition Labour party in a bid to find a way through. - \\'As soon as possible\\' -But these talks are moving slowly and the prime minister is under intense pressure from hardline Brexit supporters in her Conservative party not to compromise. As she arrived May said she wanted to leave the EU \"as soon as possible\". \"I\\'ve asked for an extension to June 30 but what is important is that any extension enables us to leave at the point at which we ratify the withdrawal agreement\" she said. EU27/UK have agreed a flexible extension until 31 October. This means additional six months for the UK to find the best possible solution. She said she still hoped to leave the EU on May 22 the last day before Britain must hold European Parliament elections. For as long as Britain is in the EU it must take part in bloc elections for them to be valid. EU leaders have already agreed one delay to Brexit from March 29 to April 12 and Tusk has warned there is \"little reason to believe\" the British parliament can ratify May\\'s deal by June 30.\\xa0 EU members want to ensure that a semi-detached Britain does not seek leverage in Brexit talks by intervening in choosing the next head of the European Commission or the next multi-year EU budget. May\\'s ministers have begun cross-party talks with Labour on a compromise to get the withdrawal agreement through the House of Commons. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wants Britain to commit to remaining within the EU customs union an idea that many in Europe would be keen to accommodate. \"We would be generous in negotiating that understanding that the UK couldn\\'t be a silent partner in such an arrangement -- it would have to have a say in decisions being made\" Irish premier Leo Varadkar said\\xa0 Angela Merkel\\'s mother has died: government Brexit delay wins May more time but how much more? \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 22nd 14:12  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Shutterstock  Jamie Oliver is to close six Jamie\\'s Italian restaurants as the celebrity chef is hit by a combination of rising Brexit cost pressures and tough trading. The closures will impact 120 staff although the company will attempt to place those affected in other parts of Oliver\\'s restaurant empire. Jamie Oliver. Photo: Press Assocation Restaurants in Aberdeen Cheltenham Exeter Ludgate Richmond (both in London) and Tunbridge Wells are all scheduled to close in the first quarter the Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group said on Friday. Chief executive Simon Blagden said: \"As every restaurant owner knows this is a tough market and post-Brexit the pressures and unknowns have made it even harder. \"While our overall business is in very good shape - we finished last year with like-for-like sales growth and an increase in covers - because we refuse to compromise on the quality and provenance of our ingredients and our commitment to training and developing our staff we need restaurants that can serve an average of 3000 covers every week to be sustainable.\" As well as staff costs and lower footfall the group has been stung by the collapse in the pound which has ramped up the cost of buying ingredients from Italy. According to accounts filed at Companies House revenue at Jamie\\'s Italian rose by almost 9% to £116.1 million (€135.4m) in 2015 although profits fell from £3.8 million (€4.4m) to £2.3 million (€2.68m). There are 42 Jamie\\'s Italian outlets in the UK and 28 overseas. It employs 3100 in Britain and Mr Blagden added: \"These closures are in no way a reflection on the dedication and commitment of our staff and my first priority is to try and secure those affected alternative jobs within other Jamie\\'s Italian restaurants. \"Where this isn\\'t possible we\\'ll be working with them to find alternative employment. Jamie\\'s Italian has become a much loved presence on the UK high street and we have our teams to thank for that. These closures represent less than 5% of total turnover and impact less than 5% of our team members.\" The group said it will now focus on the \"core Jamie\\'s Italian estate\" and on the expansion of the Barbecoa brand which will see two new openings in 2017. Internationally the firm plans to launch another 22 Jamie\\'s Italian restaurants and develop its newly acquired Australian restaurants. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

John Longworth gave a keynote speech on Thursday in which he said the referendum was a choice between the \"devil and the deep blue sea\" with the options being to remain in an unreformed EU or to face \"near-term uncertainty and disruption\" in the wake of a Brexit. However he later told Sky News: \"I actually went on in my speech beyond what the Chambers of Commerce believe to talk a little bit about what my analysis of the evidence has been. \"And my analysis of the evidence is that actually with the reforms that we received so far the UK would be better off taking a decision to leave the European Union.\" According to the Financial Times Mr Longworth who has been director general of the BCC since 2011 was later temporarily suspended for breaching its official stance of neutrality. In a statement before reports of the suspension arose the BCC said it \"will not be campaigning for either side ahead of the EU referendum\". A spokesman said: \"The BCC will survey Chamber member companies across the UK report their diverse views and inform the debate. \"The BCC\\'s director general has been very clear where his remarks reflect his personal assessment rather than the position of the BCC.\" Phil Smith managing director of the largest chamber in the BCC Business West told the Financial Times he was \"appalled\" by the director general\\'s \"very public\" claim that Britain would be better served outside the EU. He said: \"Chambers up and down the country are at this time carefully listening to their members\\' views and ensuring that we properly represent our business community in this very important and complicated issue.\" He added: \"I don\\'t believe that John had a mandate from the 50 or so British accredited chambers of commerce that he is supposed to represent.\" Richard Swart a member of the north-east chamber told the newspaper the interview was a \"dereliction of duty to most members\\' views\". Mr Longworth\\'s comments in support of leaving the EU contradicts many of the national business body\\'s 2000 members. A survey in September revealed 60% would vote to remain while 30% would vote to leave. Of those surveyed 10% were undecided. The controversy came as a survey of 1000 employers by job site reed.co.uk showed that almost two-thirds were in favour of staying in the EU. Just over half said Brexit would put UK jobs at risk. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Chris Sant Fournier  When the Brits decided to pull out of the EU they obviously even if most perversely thought it was the right decision. The Brits those old Empire-lovers sang their hurrahs and said sod off to all those confused and confusing continentals.However Britain is hardly having a resoundingly good time of it all. Leaving has been most problematic. Someone recently compared the situation most eloquently and succinctly: Britain is now like the glorious Titanic which it was claimed was unsinkable but proceeded to sink rather ingloriously. The human toll was terrible on that fatal maiden trip.Now imagine the passengers were stopped way before they hit the iceberg and told they could decide to return to land. As an aside they are told that there are some potential problems and the ship considered indestructible not so solid. And they are also told that the pictures in the brochure selling the trip were part of a hoax.I believe in the present circumstances there is a way out—in the face of total annihilation or grave consequences. Brexit can be reversed—and a second referendum should be held. All this is sadly echoed on our shores.Thankfully we do not have anyone crying out to leave the EU—those old days of desperate ideas seem long buried. But the opposition is in dire straits and democracy which has suffered numerous dents is tangibly sliding further down the chute. Dexit too should happen—no I’m not clamouring for the Danes to leave the EU but for the PN to realise that even if Adrian Delia won the leadership through a democratic election they should oust him now with no further hesitation. If doom is staring you in the face you should change course and decisions reversed.Dexit—a quick exit plan for Delia and his cronies who have hijacked a party which was on a losing streak yet still had functioning foundations and principles. Now it is a ship with no rudder no ballast and heading straight towards its doom like the Titanic towards its iceberg.Decisions even if taken democratically should be studied objectively and if their consequences are grave and tragedy-inducing it is more than mad to stick to them.So I say dump Brexit and dump Delia. Or at least give the voters a second chance to face facts and take a wiser decision now before it is too late. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Sterling’s drop helped to push up London’s stock market that features numerous multinationals earnings in other currencies while eurozone equity indices were little changed from Friday’s close. “Thanks to the pound’s shaky start the FTSE was able to continue its recent rally” noted Connor Campbell an analyst at the Spreadex trading group. British Prime Minister Theresa May’s government on Sunday warned that it may not hold a planned Brexit vote this week unless it feels it can secure a win that avoids a lengthy delay to pulling out of the EU. The pound rallied last week illustrating markets’ surprising confidence of there being an eventual smooth EU exit for Britain despite political unrest over sealing the country’s divorce. But weekend developments once more triggered worries about a chaotic no-deal departure occurring instead. Elsewhere yesterday Asian stock markets closed higher as investors tracked Friday’s positive lead from Wall Street on optimism over China-US trade talks while attention turns to a Federal Reserve policy meeting this week. “The signing of a trade deal between the US and China would eliminate one major headwind for global markets and is currently the more probable outcome” said James Hughes chief market analyst at AxiTrader. “There is more of an incentive for both superpowers to make a deal because it is economically in their best interests. This is especially the case given the growing US trade deficit due to falling exports to China.” The Fed’s upcoming meeting will meanwhile be closely followed for clues on the outlook for US interest rates with some observers suggesting that the central bank would pare its pace of hikes in the face of a slowing global economy. On the corporate front yesterday share prices in Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank rallied after Germany’s two biggest lenders on Sunday said they planned formal talks over a possible merger. The banks both grappling with painful restructurings after years of falling profits have long been the subject of merger rumours. The main oil futures contracts were up after major oil producers led by Saudi Arabia agreed yesterday to keep working together to prop up crude prices although they said they would decide only in June on whether to extend production cuts. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The International Monetary Fund said Monday it was \"imperative\" to resolve the uncertainty surrounding how Britain will leave the European Union which it said was posing a threat to the British and global economy. \"We have already seen the negative effect of this uncertainty on British investment\" IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath told reporters in Davos ahead of the opening of the World Economic Forum. \"It is imperative for leaders to resolve this uncertainty immediately.\" The IMF had already calculated that if Britain crashed out of the EU without a deal the result would be \"a decline in long-run ... GDP of five to eight per cent\" she said. \"So that would be quite significant. It is absolutely essential that this uncertainty is resolved sooner than later\" she said. Gopinath\\'s comments came after the IMF released an update to its global economic forecast showing that a range of uncertainties including Brexit but also US-China trade confrontations were threatening to drag down global growth even further. The World Economic Outlook cut the global GDP forecast for this year to 3.5 per cent from the 3.7 per cent projected in October. And for 2020 the estimate was trimmed to 3.6 per cent. While it cut forecasts for a number of national economies it forecast 1.5 per cent 2019 growth for Britain the same as in October. But it warned the estimate is fraught with uncertainty since \"as of mid-January the shape that Brexit will ultimately take remains highly uncertain\". London and Brussels have spent the best part of two years working on a divorce deal but members of Britain\\'s lower House of Commons comprehensively rejected Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s proposed deal last week. She will unveil a \"Plan B\" on Monday but fears are growing that Britain will crash out of the EU on March 29 unless MPs can force a delay or come up with an alternative plan that Brussels is also happy with before the deadline. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British and EU officials were meeting Saturday to try again to break the deadlock over their divorce deal less than three weeks before Brexit. The two sides are trying to find a way to make the withdrawal agreement acceptable to British MPs who have already rejected it once and will vote again on Tuesday. Sources in London and Brussels said \"technical talks\" continued on Saturday but there were no political-level discussions planned at this stage. British Prime Minister Theresa May has promised her MPs to try to secure changes to the deal\\'s arrangements for the Irish border after Brexit. But her demands have been rejected by Brussels raising the risk that Britain severs 46 years of ties with the EU on March 29 with no new arrangements in place. In what was taken as a sign that London does not expect any new concessions finance minister Philip Hammond on Saturday urged MPs to back the deal regardless. Hammond who makes his spring budget statement on Wednesday told the Financial Times that approval would enable him to start spending money set aside for a \"no deal\" divorce. In a speech on Friday May called for \"one more push\" in talks with the EU warning that another rejection by MPs would provoke \"a moment of crisis\". The backstop proposes that Britain stay in the EU\\'s customs union and parts of its single market until and unless another way - such as a trade deal - is found to avoid checks on the Irish border. MPs believe this could trap Britain in the customs union and May has been pressing for a time limit unilateral exit mechanism or a new arbitration system to allay their fears. In response to May\\'s speech on Friday EU negotiator Michel Barnier offered a \"joint interpretative statement\" to give legal force to previous assurances that the backstop would only be temporary. In a series of tweets he also noted the deal already had an arbitration panel that would allow Britain to challenge the operation of the backstop if the EU is not doing its best to find an alternative. Finally he noted Britain could exit the EU\\'s customs union unilaterally but at the same time would have to leave Northern Ireland in the single market. London has angrily rejected this. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Stocks rose worldwide for the first time in three days and sterling and the euro climbed yesterday as investors made a rush for Brexit-bashed assets. Bargain-hunting prevailed but there was still widespread uncertainty over Britain’s vote to leave the European Union as the bloc’s leaders including soon-to-be-ex-UK-Prime-Minister David Cameron held their first post-vote meeting in Brussels. European shares were up 2.3 per cent clawing back some of their 10 per cent loss in the wake of the vote in favour of Brexit on Friday. Wall Street shares also bounced back with banking shares recovering some of what they had lost. The S&P financial index rose more than 1.55 per cent. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 138.5 points or 0.81 per cent to 17278.74 the S&P 500 gained 20.29 points or 1.01 per cent to 2020.83 and the Nasdaq Composite added 67.55 points or 1.47 per cent to 4661.99. Britain’s Lloyds and Barclays jumped 6.8 and four per cent respectively. Italy’s Unicredit was up three per cent and Spain’s Bankia surged 8.89 per cent. Sterling also got a reprieve. Up 1.1 per cent against the greenback at $1.3371 it regained some ground after hitting a 31-year low of $1.3122 on Monday. The euro was last up 0.4 per cent against the dollar at $1.1068 after hitting a three-and-a-half-month low of $1.0909 on Friday. Against the yen sterling rose 1.55 per cent to 136.85 . Even so the lack of clarity over how a British exit from the EU will proceed could fuel volatility in the weeks to come. The major concern for investors – aside from the political ramifications – is whether already struggling banks can survive if Brexit prompts central banks in Europe Switzerland Scandinavia and Japan to cut interest rates even more deeply into negative territory. Safe-haven assets gold and US Treasuries stepped back after two heady days. Spot gold fell one per cent at $1311.61 an ounce at 1355 GMT yesterday. Oil prices regained ground rising two per cent while investors refocused on potential supply outages and drawdowns in crude. A looming strike at several Norwegian oil and gas fields that threatened to cut output in western Europe’s biggest producer helped support crude futures. Brent crude futures were up 2.1 per cent or $1 at $48.16 per barrel. US crude rose 2.3 per cent or 1.10 to $47.43. Risk appetite was also beginning to resurface in bond markets. Benchmark 10-year US Treasury notes were 5/32 lower in price yielding 1.477 per cent up nearly two basis points from late Monday. But concerns about sluggish economic growth countered some of the relief from the stock market recovery leaving Treasury prices mostly flat. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain voted narrowly to leave the EU in a referendum June 23 but Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to formally trigger the process of negotiating the country\\'s exit from the 28-nation bloc. Mrs Merkel said in an interview released by her party: \"The whole process of the exit still lies ahead of us but the decision is irrevocable.\" She added that the decision is a test for the EU and said: \"Now we must negotiate on the basis of our interests. And \\'negotiate\\' means above all strengthening common projects.\" Mrs Merkel said the EU offers its members a strong voice in the world that individual countries would not have. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 22nd 14:12  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

I supported Britain remaining in the European Union and I understand very well the frustrations of those like Jean-Claude Juncker who keep saying the UK should not expect a free lunch. That argument feeds into the hands of the Brexiteers who counter-argue thus: “But we bought the restaurant”. Over these many years the UK has been perchance an unwilling net contributor to the EU. Presently we pay in around £350 million a week net and receive a rebate back of £100 million. Hardly the greatest of bargains for a club member that might claim ownership\\xa0of the fancy EU bistro which would like to settle a very odd\\xa0bill. That means every citizen of the UK pays in £200 per week to support the EU. How much do the other member countries pay I wonder? On top of that we pay in full for Nato support to discourage despots like Russia expanding into eastern Europe. How much do most European taxpayers pay? The simple answer is in the main – very little. So the Brexiteers do have strong arguments until we look more closely at the figures. The subsidy we have been paying to the EU is equivalent to the tax smokers pay in the UK per annum to enjoy the doubtful benefits of nicotine addiction and similar to what we pay out in foreign aid. So the UK is both generous abroad but rather punitive at home when it comes to the price of a packet of cigarettes at least. I turn my attention to corruption and the ‘secret shopper’. I have a friend who recently arrived in Malta to enjoy a holiday with his wife and friends. His experience at his hotel was second to none. He did not arrive under the guise of a potential investor in Malta. In fact most low-profile visitors who need to make independent judgements about the state of the Maltese economy are circumspect in the extreme. They are certainly not looking for the Maltese Tourism Authority to advertise their clients’ wares on private aircraft. Or indeed plaster their company offerings on billboards across the island. I asked my\\xa0friend to give me a quick comment about the touristexperience. Second to none. What about inward investment? “The country is shambolic and I cannot believe what I am reading. Everyone seems to be at each other’s throats and there is no sense of purpose here.” I can tell you that at least one major UK bank will not now be looking towards Malta to create a European hub prior to Brexit. More to the point there are many other ‘secret shoppers’ who see the wood for the trees and are saying “Let’s go to Luxembourg or Dublin”. I have said what needs to be said and the politicians can discard it as they will. However the secret shopper will stay around a while longer and unless sense and sensibility returns to Malta pretty damn quick their reports will all become\\xa0 very toxic to the economy and hence to every Maltese citizen whether rich or poor.

Sterling sank to a seven-year low today as companies and investors rushed to insure themselves against the chances of a British exit from the European Union that HSBC said could knock 15 percent off the value of pound. The aftermath of David Cameron\\'s announcement of a June 23 referendum on \"Brexit\" has driven the worst three days for the world\\'s fourth most traded currency since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. Another wave of selling in London this morning drove it to less than $1.39 within 4 cents of levels not seen since it sank to parity to the dollar in the mid-1980s. \"There are very few people willing to take the other side of the move lower\" said Josh O\\'Byrne a strategist at Citi. \"Knowing now that the vote will be in June there is a greater incentive for those that haven\\'t hedged GBP exposure to do so.\" The cost of currency derivatives which allow companies big institutional investors and hedge funds to protect future revenues or asset values held in sterling against sharp swings in the currency jumped to their highest in more than four years. HSBC Britain\\'s biggest bank said the currency could lose up to 15 percent of its value and UK economic growth could be up to 1.5 percentage points lower next year if Britain votes to leave. The latest poll showed the \"In\" camp only narrowly ahead at 51 percent versus 39 percent for \"Out\" with 10 percent undecided. Other polls have been even closer. Sterling fell to $1.3878 with analysts saying the 2009 low of $1.35 now a real prospect. It fell 0.6 percent to its weakest in 16 months against the euro. The Bank of England\\'s broader trade-weighted measure of the currency\\'s broader strength fell 1 percent to its lowest in two years. \"A vote for Brexit would have potentially huge consequences for all asset classes\" HSBC said. \"Following a vote to leave we think uncertainty could grip the UK economy triggering a potential slowdown in growth and a collapse in sterling.\" So far however the reaction on other UK markets has been far more muted. Government bond prices are steady on the week any nervousness among investors holding UK assets offset by the prospect that the vote will further push back any rises in interest rates by the Bank of England. Governor Mark Carney said yesterday that the bank could still use rate cuts and a broadening of a bond-buying programme to boost Britain\\'s economy if needed after the Brexit vote. Gilt yields have edged lower for four out of the last five trading sessions and have moved mostly in tandem with German Bund yields. The 10-year gilt yield is so far down around 5 basis points this week at 1.364 percent. London\\'s stock exchange has also seen a far more mixed response. Some property companies have been targeted as potential losers from the vote while others have benefited from the assumption that a weaker pound would help exports. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 22nd 14:12  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Controversial government analysis stating that any outcome from Brexit would damage the economy will be released if MPs demand it Downing Street has said. The move is in stark contrast to comments Prime Minister Theresa May made en route to China when she said making the leaked documents public would be \"wrong\". The climbdown came as the Government faced possible defeat on Wednesday over an opposition \"humble address\" motion calling for the documents to be released. Downing Street also said Justice Minister Phillip Lee had been called in by the Chief Whip after he tweeted that if the figures in the leaked assessment are \"anywhere near right\" there should be a \"serious question\" about the government\\'s approach to Brexit. Pressed on whether Mrs May was wrong to state the documents should not be released a government spokesman told a Westminster briefing: \"No because the analysis that is requested by this humble address is incomplete and that is what we have said. \"This was produced without ministerial sign-off and has been leaked and therefore is incomplete. \"If the House decides it wants to see this analysis even though it is provisional and has not gone through the proper processes ... then we will abide by the will of the House.\" Downing Street said the PM had seen a first draft of the analysis last week. A spokesman said: \"It is right and it is correct for the civil service to prepare these sorts of analyses to help inform the government\\'s decision as the end state negotiations continue.\" Downing Street said the partial analysis had not modelled Mrs May\\'s preferred outcome of a bespoke deal with the EU. Earlier the PM dismissed the significance of the leaked Government studies. The papers prepared by the Department for Exiting the EU and obtained by website Buzzfeed suggested that even with a comprehensive trade deal of the kind Mrs May is seeking UK growth would be down by 5% over the next 15 years. This would rise to 8% if Britain left without a deal and was forced to fall back on World Trade Organisation rules. But Mrs May said the findings were \"very preliminary\" and did not address the actual deal which she is hoping to conclude. \"It would be wrong to describe this as \\'the Brexit impact assessment\\'\" the Prime Minister told reporters travelling with her on a trade mission to China. \"There is analysis being done. This is very preliminary. \"It would be wrong to publish analysis before that analysis has been completed and it would also be wrong to publish analysis which might prejudice our negotiating position and indeed Parliament itself has accepted that.\" Number 10 said the Tories would not take part in the vote on the humble address motion which would be binding if passed. The analysis could be given to a select committee or directly to MPs Downing Street said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday called on the European Union to strike a new deal to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland and demanded Brussels quickly respond to her \\'white paper\\' plan to avoid a damaging no-deal Brexit. In a speech to politicians and business leaders in Belfast\\'s docklands May accepted a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic once Britain leaves the bloc would be \"almost inconceivable\" but dismissed the EU\\'s current plan as \"unworkable.\" Instead May said the EU must engage with her Brexit \\'white paper\\' policy document released earlier this month which proposes negotiating the closest possible links for trade in goods to protect businesses and to fulfil a commitment to avoid having infrastructure on the border. \"[It is] now for the EU to respond. Not simply to fall back onto previous positions which have already been proven unworkable. But to evolve their position in kind\" she told the audience at Belfast’s Waterfront Hall. Still reeling after her Brexit plan triggered the resignation of senior members of her cabinet May flew to Northern Ireland on Thursday for a two-day visit to see up close the troubled British region\\'s frontier with EU-member Ireland. The 500-kilometre border has become one of the biggest stumbling blocks in the negotiations. It has been largely invisible since army checkpoints were taken down after a 1998 peace deal ended three decades of violence between the region\\'s pro-British majority and an Irish nationalist minority. Over 3600 died. May in December agreed in principle to a binding \"backstop\" to ensure a soft border irrespective of future EU-UK ties but later balked at an EU proposal to achieve this by treating Northern Ireland as a separate customs area to the rest of the United Kingdom.\\xa0The economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal \\'third country\\' customs border within our own country is something I will never accept Her Conservative Party and Democratic Unionist Party allies in parliament have angrily objected to arrangements that would create any kind of border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. \"The economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal \\'third country\\' customs border within our own country is something I will never accept and I believe no British Prime Minister could ever accept\" May said. The Irish government which has said it has concerns about May\\'s white paper on Friday said a backstop was essential but could be renegotiated. \"The only thing that could replace this current form of a backstop is No. 1 something which is better; No. 2 something which is agreed and No. 3 something that would be legally operable\" Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe told RTE radio. The EU has warned business to get ready for Britain crashing out of the bloc without agreed terms although officials and diplomats still think some kind of deal is more likely than not if only because the cost for both sides would be so high. While May is trying to convince Brussels to make concessions on Northern Ireland she is also trying to shore up support in her Conservative Party after her white paper proposals sparked cabinet level resignations last week. After quitting former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson singled out her treatment of the border as the biggest mistake of her negotiations with the EU for a smooth exit from the bloc next year and risked leaving Britain in a \"miserable permanent limbo\". In her speech May hit back dismissing Johnson\\'s suggestion that technology could allow customs checks without physical infrastructure saying such systems did not yet exist. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The pound dropped versus the dollar and euro yesterday after British MPs once again rejected a series of alternative options to Prime Minister Theresa May’s EU divorce deal. Reacting to Monday’s votes the European Union’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier warned it is “day after day more likely” that Britain will crash out of the bloc next week without an orderly withdrawal agreement. In afternoon trading in London the pound was down about 0.4 per cent versus both the dollar and euro. London’s benchmark FTSE 100 index rose by one per cent on the pound’s fall as it features several multinationals who earn vast sums in dollars. “As ever the pound is the clearest gauge of the market’s view on continued (Brexit) uncertainty and is halfheartedly losing ground against the euro and the dollar” said Fiona Cincotta senior market analyst at City Index. “Parliamentary disarray is also hitting the euro because a disorderly Brexit has the potential to affect European companies trading with the UK” Ms Cincotta added in a client note. Trading on Wall Street opened slightly down after the opening bell yesterday. The dip in New York followed a US government report that orders for durable goods fell in February by far more than expected. In another downbeat note for the economic outlook the World Trade Organization forecast yesterday that global trade growth would be lower in 2019 than last year. In its main annual forecast the WTO revised its prediction for this year down from 3.7 percent to 2.6 percent citing widespread “tensions” and economic uncertainty including Brexit and tariffs between the US and China. Traders are now awaiting the start of the next round of top-level China US trade talks in Washington after reports of progress in last week’s meeting in Beijing. A series of olive branch measures from the Chinese side has lifted hopes the two will eventually reach a deal to end their tariffs row which dragged on equities at the end of 2018. This week also sees the release of US March jobs data which are closely watched for an idea about the state of the economy with the Federal Reserve also using the figures to map its path for monetary policy. The Fed’s recent dovish lean has helped propel a rally across stock markets this year with other central banks also looking to ease up on their tightening moves. “Having the central banks take a step back with the Fed saying that they’re going to pause and that they’re going to be patient at least toward the end of this year I think that gives the market a little bit of time” to wait for economic data to turn around said Victoria Fernandez chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments in Houston.

British households’ expectations about their personal finances held steady in September a survey showed yesterday another sign that consumers so far have been largely unperturbed by the country’s vote to leave the EU. Financial data firm Markit said its Household Finance Index stayed broadly flat at 44.8 in September from its August level of 44.9 maintaining the rebound from a plunge in July shortly after the referendum on EU membership. Expectations for living costs in 12 months’ time dropped to their lowest since January. The Bank of England has predicted that households will gradually feel the pinch of weaker spending power following the referendum as the sharp fall in the value of sterling trickles down to consumer prices. The BoE last month cut interest rates to a record low and took other measures to help the economy cope with the effects of the Brexit vote. “A swift monetary policy response and a more settled political picture have likely helped to allay fears of a severe downturn” Markit economist Philip Leake said in a statement. The survey showed 25 per cent of households expected another BoE rate cut “at some time” down from 39 per cent in August. The BoE said on September 15 that it was likely to cut rates again before the end of the year pending its November assessment of the economic outlook. The online survey of about 1500 people was conducted by polling firm Ipsos MORI between September 14 and 18. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s formal exit notification made it an unhappy day for London and Brussels with EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker saying he was \\'deeply sad\\'. European Council President Donald Tusk told reporters difficult talks about Britain\\'s exit would simply be about limiting damage for both sides while Mr Juncker said Britons would eventually regret their decision. Tusk a former Polish prime minister who chairs meetings of EU leaders waved papers as he began a short statement in Brussels.  \"So here it is. Six pages. The notification from Prime Minister Theresa May triggering Article 50 and formally starting negotiations for the United Kingdom\\'s withdrawal from the European Union\" he told reporters less than an hour after receiving the letter from the British ambassador. \"There is no reason to pretend today is a happy day neither in Brussels nor in London. After all most Europeans including almost half the British voters wished that we would stay together not drift apart\" he continued. Tusk who will share a proposal of the negotiating guidelines with the other 27 member states on Friday said there was one positive from Brexit - that it had made the remaining EU members more determined and united than before ahead of \"difficult negotiations\". Tusk said the EU\\'s goal was to minimise the costs for EU citizens businesses and member states whose leaders should adopt the negotiating proposals on April 29. \"There is nothing to win in this process and I\\'m talking about both sides. In essence this is about damage control\" he said. Concluding his brief remarks to the media in Brussels Tusk said he had little to add about Britain: \"What can I add to this? We already miss you.

Britain’s exit negotiations with the EU may become one of the top priorities in Malta’s presidency of the European Council according to a Brussels veteran. Peter Agius who heads the European Parliament office in Malta and has helped in the preparations for 10 different presidencies says Brexit talks may very well be one of the main issues Malta has to deal with when it takes over the six-month rotating presidency on January 1 of next year. The UK has not yet initiated the exit procedure with British Prime Minister David Cameron telling his EU counterparts last week that he wanted that decision to be taken by his successor. Mr Cameron resigned after the British voted to leave the EU in a referendum for which he campaigned for the UK to remain in the bloc. His successor should be known by September 9. But Theresa May one of the front-runners to take over from Mr Cameron said last week that the formal request to leave the EU would not be triggered until the end of the year if she won the contest. Another leadership hopeful Michael Gove said he did not expect the request to be triggered this year. EU rules do not dictate what role the presidency should play in the case of a country wanting to leave the bloc Dr Agius says. Exit negotiations are unprecedented but he expects the presidency may well take on the same role as it does when negotiating an accession agreement. It will negotiate a withdrawal agreement with Britain after achieving consensus with the European Parliament. “If that process happens at the fast pace currently being foreseen then I should think Malta’s presidency will have a part of the responsibility in the Brexit negotiations” he says. If the process happens at the fast pace being foreseen then I should think Malta’s presidency will have a part of the responsibility in the Brexit negotiations Brexit has spawned calls for introspection by some of the leaders of the 28 member states. At last week’s EU summit Prime Minister Joseph Muscat called for a debate on the causes that pushed British voters to reject EU membership as differing voices emerged on the future direction of the European project. Dr Agius says that taken at face value the European project is an “impossible task” because it seeks to bring together 28 member states spanning the entirety of the political spectrum and their many conflicting interests. Progress can only be made through consensus which is what the EU Council presidency aims to achieve Dr Agius adds. Most EU Council decisions can be taken using a qualified majority vote which pushes through legislation even if a number of member states oppose it. But despite this voting system the EU Council presidency always seeks to achieve the widest consensus possible. Asked if he thinks this spirit of goodwill will still be present in a post-Brexit EU where member states are increasingly sceptical of further integration Dr Agius says that Britain’s departure may actually strengthen the EU’s resolve. At a very basic level the role of presidency of the EU entails chairing 1500 meetings mainly held in Brussels. But says Dr Agius chairing meetings is only a small part of a much more complex process. “This includes preparations of the policy dossiers procedural preparations as well as all the necessary groundwork to ensure that the proposal of one member state is accepted by another.” The spotlight will be on Malta throughout the presidency and a number of informal meetings will be held on the island. No binding decisions can be taken during these informal meetings. “We have to be clear that in Malta no meeting may have a decision-making bearing on the EU and its institutions. This is an interesting procedural aspect. Any binding decision has to be taken in Brussels. “In Malta you will have what we call informals. Informal meetings an informal council and informal attachés.” These meetings serve as the building blocks towards achieving political consensus for when the big decisions are taken in Brussels. The Prime Minister has floated the possibility of Malta stepping in to take over part or all of Britain’s EU Council presidency when its own term ends in July although he has indicated this was not the preferred option. Dr Agius sees an extended term at the helm as being well within Malta’s capabilities. “From a technical perspective once a presidency is in office you know your responsibilities and the challenges involved. Therefore extending this term would be pretty easy thought it would require an increased effort and additional material investment. “Once you take over the presidency it almost becomes natural to keep on going. I have seen multiple presidencies having to be wrested away from the chair” Dr Agius says. Government ministers will be responsible for giving an account to the European Parliament on the ambitions of the Maltese presidency. “The European Parliament is the voice of the citizens. A minister who will be chairing the Council needs to deliver his vision to the Parliament and answer to the specific challenges.” Asked if Minister Without Portfolio Konrad Mizzi could face a difficult time in the European Parliament Dr Agius replies that MEPs in the technical committees conducting the questioning tend to focus on the policy areas in question rather than broad political issues. Quick facts • EU countries usually budget between €40 million to €60 million for the EU Council presidency role. • A significant amount of this budget is spent on ‘marketing’ the country in charge of the presidency • Around 1500 meetings will be chaired by Malta during its time at the helm • Ministers will be grilled by the European Parliament on their ambitions for the presidency. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Andrew Yates/Reuters  Julian Sarkar has spent over 10 years and around €600000 making his small UK company com\\xadpliant with strict EU regulations to import chemicals into the bloc. Now incensed by the government’s pursuit of what he sees as an extreme version of Brexit he is shifting a third of his\\xa0business\\xa0to continental Europe fearing that higher costs and bureaucracy will prove toxic for his firm over time. “I despair” said the 59-year-old who will avoid UK ports when shipping goods from India and China to continental Europe with his firm Zanos. “Everything I’ve seen in terms of the new approach will involve additional cost and additional work”. Zanos is one of thousands of British companies that could be stripped of the right to trade seamlessly in Europe after Brexit if a way cannot be found to keep Britain in or aligned to the regulatory system Reach which acts as a passport for chemicals. At stake is not just the future of an £11 billion industry and its thousands of British jobs but also the other sectors it supplies including cars aerospace and pharmaceuticals. The chemicals sector’s quandary is more acute than most industries’ because of its dense web of regulations but it is also emblematic of problems facing several other trades that rely on some kind of ‘passporting’ system to operate across the EU like financial servi\\xadces and haulage. Prime Minister Theresa May has said she wants Britain to remain under European oversight for certain sectors including chemicals but be allowed to diverge from the EU in others a position dismissed as pure illusion by Brussels so far. On top of the regulatory uncertainty the prospect of tariffs or border delays remains while any Brexit deal may not come until late in the talks leaving firms with little clarity. As a result the bigger chemical makers are preparing for all outcomes. Germany’s BASF worth €76 billion estimates that a British return to World Trade Organisation rules could cost it an additional €60 million a year. “At the moment you really get the impression of two high-speed trains on a collision course with no constructive solution to be found” BASF chief executive Kurt Bock said in February of his fears about tariffs. “Something must happen very quickly.” Of immediate concern is Reach a regulatory regime so complex it has taken 11 years to be introduced. Designed to manage risk while protecting health and the environment it operates across the 28 EU member states plus Norway Iceland and Liechtenstein that make up the European Economic Area (EEA). Standing for Registration Evalu\\xadation Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals Reach requires companies to register the substances they use creating a vast central database that is managed by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki. According to the ECHA Britain becomes a ‘third country’ after March 29 2019 making Reach regis\\xadtrations held by British companies invalid. A transition deal which was announced last week should postpone that until the end of 2020 if a future trade deal with the EU is agreed before Brexit. “This is a big deal” said Elizabeth Shepherd environment partner at corporate law firm Eversheds Sutherland who is facing mounting questions from clients. “If companies have to comply with two sets of rules then they run the risk of being less competitive.” Zanos’ Sarkar said he decided to act after May said at the start of 2017 that Britain would leave the EU single market and customs union after Brexit. May’s government argues that being outside the EU will give Britain the freedom to strike trade deals with faster-growing emerging markets and that although the economy may suffer in the short term it will flourish later on. But for now Sarkar cannot see beyond the disruption. Based in the leafy town of Knutsford northern England the 18-year-old firm he set up sources imports and distributes aromatic chemicals such as Benzyl Alcohol and Linalol which go into cleaning sprays shower gels candles and other products. It employs five people has annual revenue of about £10 million and holds around 10 Reach registrations. In a bid to insulate as much of the\\xa0business\\xa0as he can Sarkar has set up an Irish company to handle the compliance and transport of chemicals imported from Asia that do not need to go through Britain around a third of his total\\xa0business. Hiring a qualified operative there will cost about €50000 a year be\\xadfore other costs Sarkar said but he would rather take the hit now than become less competitive over time. “We buy significant materials from China that are sold in Europe” Sarkar said clutch\\xading\\xa0business plans for the new company. “The intention is that anything that doesn’t require UK input will not come here. We’ll just keep it out.” For future British-EU trade he expects costs and red tape to rise if Britain launches its own Reach system with its own regulator forcing Zanos to comply with two systems at once. That could also put some European companies off selling into Britain work Zanos currently handles. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

But worried winemakers in Italy fear potential new trade tariffs would put a huge dent in a market which sees a whopping 120 million bottles of Prosecco exported to the UK each year. \"There could be price rises\" said Mattia Mattiuzzo vice-president of regional farmers\\' union Coldiretti. \"Without a deal it will perhaps be difficult to find a placement for the product.\" The UK is the\\xa0Italian fizz’s top market. Brits guzzle down 35 per cent of exports of the sparkling white wine made in the Veneto region of northeastern Italy with the DOC label as well as the superior DOCG category. But as it becomes increasingly clear that British Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s withdrawal deal will not pass the odds of a no-deal hard Brexit appear greater along with all the trade uncertainty that would bring. \"It could create discontent among English consumers as it could create economic difficulties for us to reach the English market\" said Mattiuzzo while gently pruning his family\\'s snaking dark vines in preparation for this year\\'s grapes. In 2016 then British foreign minister Boris Johnson caused a diplomatic spat with Italy after apparently suggesting it should back his version of a Brexit deal or face losing Prosecco sales. The threat was rebuffed by Italy\\'s then economic development minister Carlo Calenda who said Britain could then miss out on \"fish and chips\" exports to the other 27 EU countries. Italian producers say importers have been stockpiling Prosecco in the UK and in Ireland where there may be a \"backstop\" entrance for their wine amid fears of increased import duties and long queues of trucks at the UK border. \\'Globalised world\\' \"This situation of uncertainty worries us (but) we\\'re confident that English citizens won\\'t give up this pleasure\" said Innocente Nardi head of the Conegliano Valdobbiadene DOCG Prosecco consortium standing among dramatic vine-draped hillsides. \"The main producers are in talks with English importers to set up import places in Ireland for instance or English-registered companies which can easily import wine\" said Nardi. \"In the worst-case scenario they should still be able to import\" he said in the dwindling grey of the northern Italian twilight.\\xa0 And if UK-bound exports falter for whatever reason there are always other markets said Nardi. President of the Producers’ Consortium for Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco DOCG Innocente Nardi. \"At the moment we’re expanding and being appreciated in a significant way in the United States of America which is an enormous market in which we’re investing and Canada and Russia\" he said. The wine is named after the nearby village of Prosecco a Slovene word meaning \"path cut through the woods\".\\xa0 The grapes used to make the wine were also called Prosecco until growers had the name changed to Glera in 2009 so that they could protect their increasingly popular brand as a geographical location. Although many winemakers are worried some believe Prosecco sales can withstand Brexit - whatever the outcome. \"I\\'m very optimistic I think little will change because now the world is globalised\" said winemaker Angelo Facchin surrounded by the vast silver tanks where the wine is fermented in\\xa0San Polo di Piave. \"Prosecco is now part of English culture. As a result it will be difficult for them to give up our Prosecco\" smiled Facchin whose family has made wine since 1870. The wine is \"not very alcoholic or expensive can be drunk at any occasion and be a replacement for beer\" Facchin added. The DOC consortium has also invested in promoting the wine including by sponsoring the Superbike World Championship. Britain now accounts for 40 per cent of Facchin\\'s turnover having expanded by 15 to 20 per cent each of the last five years.\\xa0 His wine is drunk at St John\\'s College Cambridge University he proudly says. While some are optimistic Stefano Zanette head of the Prosecco DOC consortium said a hard Brexit would be a \"leap into the unknown\". While not wanting to get involved in British politics Zanette said he supported the idea of a second referendum in the UK on its relationship with the EU. \"Most people didn\\'t realise the consequences of their choice\" he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 22nd 14:12  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The British government will have a third attempt next week at getting MPs to approve the revived Brexit deal agreed between London and Brussels. Following a vote in the British parliament on Thursday to seek an extension to the Brexit process from March 29 to June 30 May will bring the withdrawal agreement back before MPs by March 20. The deal is aimed at ensuring a smooth exit from the European Union to be followed by a transition period that could last until 2022. The 585-page withdrawal agreement was voted down overwhelmingly by the British parliament in January and again on Tuesday. However the government is hoping that the looming deadline will persuade many MPs to change their minds. Brexit hardliners have objected in particular to the agreement\\'s \"backstop\" provisions on the Irish border which they fear could lock Britain indefinitely into a customs union with the EU. After more talks with the EU May on Monday said she had secured \"legally binding\" changes to the Irish border issue. But her government\\'s top law official a respected lawyer on Tuesday ruled that while the likelihood of being stuck in EU trade arrangements had reduced risks from its most contentious legal points remained \"unchanged\". The other main elements in the agreement are the protection of citizens\\' rights and Britain\\'s final bill to the EU. Following are the main points of the deal: Transition period A transition period lasting until December 31 2020 would preserve the status quo and allow time for Britain and the EU to negotiate their future relations. It would also allow governments businesses and individual citizens to adapt to life after Brexit. The only major difference during that period is that Britain would no longer be represented in EU institutions. Britain would continue to participate in the EU Customs Union and the Single Market and must respect EU rules on free movement of goods capital services and labour. The transition period can be extended once for one or two years meaning it could last until December 31 2022. Irish \\'backstop\\' The deal outlines a \"backstop\" arrangement to prevent the return of border checks between the British province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if the sides fail to agree a free trade pact following the transition period. Under the arrangement Britain and the EU would form a single customs territory and Northern Ireland would also follow EU single market rules on the movement of goods to allow the border to remain free-flowing. Northern Irish businesses would be able to bring goods into the EU single market without restrictions. At any point after the transition period the EU or Britain could decide that the arrangement was no longer necessary - but crucially they must take the decision together. Some British MPs fear Britain could be stuck in the arrangement indefinitely which would hamper its ambition to develop an independent trade policy. \\'Citizens rights\\' The draft deal preserves the rights of the more than three million EU citizens living in Britain and the one million British citizens living in the EU. EU and UK citizens as well as their family members can continue to live work or study enjoying equal treatment to host nationals under the respective laws. It covers all such citizens who arrive before the transition period ends. They will maintain their right to healthcare pensions and other social security benefits. EU citizens arriving in Britain after the end of the transition period -- whenever that is -- will be subject to more stringent immigration rules that are currently being debated in the British parliament. Brexit bill Covering Britain\\'s outstanding financial obligations to the bloc it calls for a fair settlement for UK taxpayers that the British government estimates to be up to £39 billion (€44 billion). Gibraltar With longstanding Spanish claims to Britain\\'s Mediterranean outcrop of Gibraltar all sides sought to defuse any future tensions. The deal provides for Spanish-British cooperation on citizens\\' rights tobacco and other products environment police and customs matters. It sets the basis for administrative cooperation for achieving full transparency in tax matters fighting fraud smuggling and money laundering. British bases in Cyprus The deal aims to ensure no disruption or loss of rights for the 11000 Cypriot civilians living and working in the areas of the British sovereign military bases. It aims to ensure that EU law will continue to apply in the base areas including on taxation goods agriculture fisheries and veterinary and phytosanitary rules. Other points It oversees the UK\\'s withdrawal from Euratom the EU treaty on nuclear energy and protects intellectual property including trademarks as well as more than 3000 EU geographical indications. The latter cover regional brands such as Welsh lamb Parma ham Champagne Bayerisches beer Feta cheese Tokaj wine Jerez vinegar. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: IMDB  When I was studying in the UK back in 1999 \\xad– paying triple the fee of other students sitting on the benches next to me because I was a non-EU student – I was offered a job with CNN London. I cannot remember the job description although I seem to remember vaguely that it was not to replace Christiane Amanpour but more likely to make tea for her. It was something junior-of-the-most-juniorest-assistant in the CNN newsroom probably with a non-desk in the tea cupboard. But! It was CNN! Twirl! Joy! Eureka! However there was one little caveat. One tiny small print condition that I could not ignore: I needed to be an EU citizen. Therein followed a series of unfortunate swearwords. I was not eligible the job went to someone else and the pain of that wound is still pulsing. That was a defining moment for me. April 5 1999 sitting on a bench in Hampstead Heath and reading the letter of acceptance and its conditions; scrunching it with cold sweaty angry hands. It was the moment when I fully embraced the European Union project – I so much wanted to be able to work outside of our tiny island. Thankfully (and luckily that at the time that people ignored Joseph Muscat there was no Facebook and no Cambridge Analytica) four years later Malta voted to become a member. And five years later as Malta was signing the accession treaty I was packing my bags to work in Luxembourg. When later my daughter was born I was delighted that she would have none of our 316\\xa0square kilometre constrictions – the whole continent was hers for exploring. And (in a moment of pure parental transference) I thought hey she could even work for CNN! That definitely cannot happen now because of this tragic unfolding drama called Brexit. However there’s no stopping her from going to Ireland Spain France Greece or wherever the wind takes her. This time round it is tragic for the British youth. The other day I was talking to a 20-something young Briton who’s definitely crush\\xaded. “I am working here in Malta now and I want to be able to go and travel and work my way round Europe. We cannot just do that now we have to renegotiate everything with every country and keep our fingers crossed” he said. The worst thing though was that his parents voted to Leave. “I didn’t speak to them for weeks! They just kept saying ‘We’ll be better off without those EU people’. I kept telling them – we are the EU people! I don’t get this ‘us and them’ mentality.” Populism feeding the monster of fear and anger By and large Brexit has become a generational issue. I was in London last September and went to the proms in the park. Young people were all kitted in EU flags the older ones dressed from head to toe in Rule Britannia Union Jacks.\\xa0 Of course there’s more to the EU than job mobility. And there are pros and cons of being a member. However over the last 20 years with a lot of help from the media some of the cons have been amplified or downright invented and for many British Europe had become nasty whipmaster to be blamed for all the little (or huge) resentments. The problem I would say lies fairly and squarely in Brussels where the bureaucratic machine is unfortunately covered in bubble wrap completely disconnected from the reality of the nations and from the pulse of the people. Without constantly explaining the bene\\xadfits of the EU and the possibility of fundings the one-people-no-boundaries people cannot be expected to grasp and embrace these concepts. Perhaps Brexit will make Brussels realise that photos of men in suits shaking hands won’t ever help people understand what the EU is. They need to put on their jeans and reach out to people in their homes. The need to go back to basics: Jean Monnet’s original idea for project Europe was to make sure that after World War II dangerous populism would be contained. He reckoned without the media and even worse social media and here we are now 70 years later with populism raising its ugly head again simply swapping radio for social media as a propaganda tool and feeding the monster of fear and anger. And the EU must act now. It cannot keep living in its polite little bubble or Brexit will become Frexit Spexit and Grexit. May I recommend that you watch Channel 4’s recently released Brexit: The Uncivil War movie. It is the drama of what goes on behind the scenes revealing the people strategies and feuds of the Leave and Remain campaigns. Significantly it highlights the tactics employed by the Leave campaigners in their data-driven misinformation campaign. One movie critic said it feels like a post-mortem performed while the patient is still alive and is just as painful.

Photo: Shutterstock  A British vote to leave the EU could cost the UK economy €126 billion and 950000 jobs by 2020 according to research commissioned by employers’ group the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). The CBI said a ‘Brexit’ would deliver a serious shock to the British economy regardless of any trade deals the country could negotiate with its former European partners. “This analysis shows very clearly why leaving the EU would be a real blow for living standards jobs and growth” CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said in a statement. “The savings from reduced EU budget contributions and regulation are greatly outweighed by the negative impact on trade and investment. Even in the best case this would cause a serious shock to the UK economy.” The CBI which has said it will promote the economic case for Britain to remain in the EU has been criticised by anti-EU campaigners who say the business community is split on the issue. Two hecklers interrupted a speech by Prime Minister David Cameron at a CBI conference in November when they unfurled a banner reading ‘CBI – Voice of Brussels’. In its defence the CBI last week published research showing that 80 per cent of its members wanted to stay in the EU while just five per cent thought leaving the bloc would help them. Britons will vote in an in-out referendum on June 23 and are more equally divided than business opinion polls show with about 40 per cent on either side and about 20 per cent undecided. A ‘Brexit’ vote would lead to heightened uncertainty The director-general of another employers group the British Chamber of Commerce resigned this month after he went public with his anti-EU views breaching the neutral position adopted by his organisation. The CBI which mainly represents larger British businesses commissioned accountants PwC to examine two different exit scenarios based on the likelihood of reaching new trade deals. Under both it said British living standards economic growth and employment would be significantly reduced compared with staying. Economic output could be curtailed by as much as about five per cent of GDP by 2020 or €126 billion it said while even in a scenario where a free trade agreement with the EU was rapidly secured GDP might still be reduced by three per cent. In another development Ratings agency Moody’s said it saw “clear downside risks” if Britain votes to leave the European Union and repeated its warning that this would make the country’s debt more vulnerable to a downgrade. Moody’s concerns come alongside a report from consultants Oxford Economics which estimated that Britain’s economy could be almost four per cent smaller than otherwise if it curbed inward migration after leaving the bloc. Moody’s currently rates British government debt one notch below triple-A with a stable outlook but said voting to leave the EU could lead to a negative outlook. “This is because we believe a Brexit vote would lead to heightened uncertainty which would manifest as modestly weaker economic growth in the UK over the medium term” Moody’s said in a note to investors. “There are clear downside risks to this assessment especially if new arrangements led to a substantial disruption in trade or capital flows” it added. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 22nd 14:12  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The British pound rose back above $1.32 yesterday as investors eyed receding no-deal risks on another day of high drama in the long-running Brexit saga. Europe\\'s stock markets turned higher in afternoon trading while Wall Street also climbed at the opening bell. Asian equities mostly rose but traders remain on edge about the global economic outlook while Brexit continues to hog the headlines. Britain\\'s parliament will hold a series of so-called “indicative” votes to seek an alternative Brexit solution as pressure mounts on Prime Minister Theresa May to resign if she wants her own unpopular plan approved. Sterling had rallied Tuesday on fresh hope that May would avoid a chaotic no-deal departure from the European Union. Yet risks remain according to Societe Generale analyst Kit Juckes. “Today\\'s Brexit horror-show/soap opera starts with debates from 2 pm on various options for the way forward as the House of Commons takes control from the government\" Juckes said. “What happens next is as uncertain as ever and one thing is clear ‒ the foreign exchange market... is still seeing risk and positions taken off the table.” MPs will now choose whether to cancel Brexit hold another referendum vote for a deal including a customs union and single market membership or leave the EU without a deal though the government is not bound by law to implement the decision. In a fresh twist May\\'s twice-rejected divorce plan could be revived after Brexit hardliner Jacob Rees-Mogg ‒ one of her most vociferous and high-profile critics ‒ said he would back it while another Boris Johnson hinted that he also could. “Though Wednesday is another... big day in the Brexit process the indicative votes likely won\\'t actually take place until 7 pm this evening meaning any reaction to the results will have to wait until Thursday morning” said Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell. “Most investors\\' attention (is) on Westminster and an alphabet soup of parliamentary motions that could shape the future direction of the Brexit grid lock\" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson. Brussels has given London a new extended deadline of April 12 to get May\\'s deal ratified or find a new way out. That replaced the previous Brexit date of March 29. “Though avoiding a swift but hard Brexit is good news for the pound going into a protracted period of uncertainty would continue to damage domestic industries and the currency” said City Index analyst Fiona Cincotta.

EU leader Donald Tusk said Thursday that European capitals could approve a long delay to Brexit in a last-ditch push to persuade Prime Minister Theresa May to change her negotiating red lines. During consultations ahead of next week\\'s EU summit Tusk said he \"will appeal to the EU27 to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy and build consensus around it.\" During my consultations ahead of #EUCO I will appeal to the EU27 to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its #Brexit strategy and build consensus around it. As president of the European Council Tusk will be the host of the March 21 summit in Brussels that may be asked to decide whether to push back Britain\\'s March 29 departure from the Union. His tweeted intervention came as British MPs prepared the latest in a series of votes on Brexit this time on whether to ask the EU for such an extension of the \"Article 50\" process. May\\'s government has said it plans to ask for a delay until June 30 if its parliament eventually votes to approve a draft withdrawal agreement already agreed with Europe but twice massively rejected by lawmakers. Tusk\\'s support for a longer delay may encourage pro-divorce MPs fearful that a Brexit deal would \"trap\" London in the Union to look again at May\\'s proposed deal which she insists is the best form of departure on offer. But the EU leader\\'s insistence on a \"rethink\" reflects Brussels\\' long-standing position that a softer Brexit is possible if May abandons red lines especially her opposition to joining a customs union with Europe. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Last Wednesday the British government handed in\\xa0the formal notification of its intention to exit\\xa0the EU marking the first-ever withdrawal of a member state in the EU bloc’s 60-year history. Both the British government and the European Commission confirmed that the act was irrevocable meaning that by April 2019 the UK will be out of the EU. The two sides now face two hectic years of negotiations to agree the terms under which the UK will be leaving the EU while also determining the nature of the UK’s relationship with the 27 member states. In view of the ensuing uncertainty as to what kind of Brexit deal will be concluded (assuming an agreement will be reached) it is fair to expect conflicting views on the immediate and the longer-term outlook for the pound sterling. Undoubtedly the long-term outlook for sterling will be determined by the final Brexit deal and other trade deals that the UK may forge with other countries such as the US and China. However shorter-term movements in the currency ahead of the April 2019 deadline will be largely dictated by the various possibilities of the Brexit deal as fresh political developments emerge. In fact in a talk delivered last week in Malta David Bloom a senior strategist at HSBC Bank plc explained that in foreign exchange markets politics is the new economics. British Prime Minister Theresa May has stated that she aims to leave the single market and clamp down on immigration. She also insisted that she wants a “bold and ambitious” trade relationship with the EU but also the freedom to negotiate trade agreements with other countries. The response of the EU negotiating team to the UK’s trigger of Article 50 should become clear by the end of this month and the stand being taken by the EU will be critical in setting the tone for exit negotiations and subsequent trade deals between the two sides. As a start it is worth recalling that in the aftermath of the Brexit vote in June 2016 sterling dropped by over 14 per cent to a 31-year low against the US dollar and also suffered a double-digit decline against the euro to the lowest level since 2010. Meanwhile the steep drop in sterling since the Brexit vote combined with a recovery in global oil prices has pushed prices higher in recent months in the British Isles (UK inflation is at its highest level in over three years) leading to fears that rising inflation will erode consumer spending which has been the main growth driver of the UK economy. Rising inflation has fuelled expectations that the Bank of England could hike interest rates quicker than expected particularly after the minutes of the March monetary policy meeting showed that one policymaker voted for a rate hike. This may have been the reason behind the recent recovery in sterling despite the official start of the Brexit process. However some economists believe that a rise in inflation driven by energy prices or by the exchange rate is less likely to prompt a rise in interest rates. This will be more dependent on any\\xa0 impact of rising wages on inflationary expectations. Another source of political uncertainty which is likely to impact the value of sterling is the recent confirmation that another Scottish independence referendum will be taking place. The majority of foreign exchange analysts expect sterling to decline further as the Brexit negotiations unfold with several of these projecting that the British pound will drop to parity (1:1) against the euro. One investment bank in particular recently indicated that their negative view on sterling is underpinned by the fact that as negotiations become increasingly difficult during the next two years the foreign exchange markets will bet on the worst possible outcome for the British economy – i.e. a “hard Brexit”. However other analysts believe that the triggering of Article 50 is already priced into the current exchange rate and therefore they are not of the view that the pound will fall any further. In fact these analysts claim that the currency could actually start to recover once there is less uncertainty on the outcome of the deal with the EU and other trading partners. Reports across the British media in recent days speculated that the UK is set to keep key EU regulation in force since there isn’t sufficient time to substitute the entire legal framework specifically in matters such as agriculture and fishing. As a result the UK government could soften its stance towards the EU trade arrangements which could benefit the outlook for the UK. In view of this hypothesis some of these analysts indicated that they expect sterling to fluctuate around current levels and possibly ease to £0.90 against the euro before recovering to £0.72 by the end of 2018. Since exchange rates are measured against one another political risks and economic developments in other regions across the world will also play a role on the value of the sterling going forward. In particular political risks in the US and also across the eurozone remain key determinants of the value of sterling against both the US dollar and the euro in the months ahead. The US dollar recently dropped to four-month lows against a basket of currencies after the Trump administration failed to push through legislation to overhaul the healthcare sector. The vote had been viewed by market players as an important test of Trump’s ability to deliver on his electoral promises encompassing tax cuts and infrastructure spending. The dollar had already weakened in early March after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates but did not signal a more aggressive pace of monetary tightening as many had anticipated. Across the EU market players are also closely monitoring political developments ahead of the upcoming French presidential elections. Although concerns may have subsided following the Dutch elections and recent polls in France the euro is likely to remain very volatile in the run-up to these elections set for between April 23 and May 7. The euro is anticipated to strengthen (against various currencies including the sterling and the US dollar) if the centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron emerges victorious. On the other hand a victory for the far-right anti-EU leader Marine Le Pen would undoubtedly lead to a collapse in the value of the euro against major currencies and as such a strengthening of sterling from this perspective. The sterling exchange rate is very much in constant focus for several Maltese investors – not only due to the impact on the fortunes of some companies listed on the MSE but also due to the exposure of various investors to foreign currency markets as well as international stock exchanges.

But ‘Keep calm and carry on’ as a stance does not make much sense without clear purpose. Photo: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP  News readers following the political drama of Brexit are either bored by now or confused or increasingly agitated by the languidness and sheer incompetence of Britain’s political elites. They are bored because it is a story without logic and a plot progressing in circles like a play written by Samuel Beckett. The painful tension of nothingness is not everyone’s cup of tea. They are confused because a seemingly simple question put forward to the British electorate by flippant public-school boys turned out to be not so simple after all. Those tasked professionally to answer it the haughty self-serving ruling classes turned out to be ignorant beyond belief. This not surprisingly does include the Labour Opposition in shocking sameness. With every day passing businesses and voters are getting angrier. Soon the British will heap abuse on all and resort to throwing bottles on the football field of politics. “Keep calm and carry on” as a stance does not make much sense without clear purpose. For us retail investors it poses the question of whether shares traded on the London Stock Exchange depressed in value as they are represent a rare buying opportunity. “Buy cheap and sell expensive” goes the investor’s adage after all. It is a view put forward now increasingly by financial journalists mostly those sympathetic to Brexit. If one dismisses the long-term implications of a divorce from the biggest trading block on earth as temporary this is only logical. Things can only go up again they say and share the insouciance of Boris Johnson for whom the worries about the Irish border dreaded deficits in labour markets and stock piling of manufacturers is nothing but hysteria – of the same category as the Millennium Bug. Interestingly many cheerleaders of Brexit have hedged their bets though. Like the top-hatted Brexit-MP Jacob Rees-Mogg who providentially transferred his fund management company to the EU; Arron Banks founding member main sponsor of the Leave.EU campaign and happy-to-be EU citizen thought it prudent to better prepare and clandestinely bought one of our golden Malta passports; James Dyson EU-hater and one of the very few UK industrialists to shout for Brexit had moved his manufacturing base to Malaysia and Singapore a long time ago already. Their insincerity is shocking but no argument against an opportunistic UK investment spree. Could it not be that UK builders unburdened by their better trained and cheaper European competitors will be able for once to make a financial killing? Is it unthinkable that shoddy eateries like JD Wetherspoon will thrive again and even Little Chef will be resurrected once demanding European customers have left? Will the spook of German discounters like Aldi and Lidl not thankfully disappear to make space for higher margins at shoddy outlets of Morrison Sainsbury or Safeway? We should approach the UK stock market with prudence. It would be misguided to sell all investments now in the fear of Armageddon I have deliberately chosen examples of companies focusing on the domestic market. The LSE as represented by the FTSE index contains to a large extent corporations whose international business will be largely unaffected by Brexit. Globally operating listed mining or energy companies for instance – and there are many of them moving the London stock market. Such corporations are more impacted by the ups and downs of world trade and global business cycles than the woes of the UK. As the economy will deteriorate – and even Brexiters acknowledge a possible loss of growth of one to two per cent of GDP for quite a few painful years – the British pound will lose in value thereby boosting the nominal profits they make in other currencies. As a rule of thumb less competition means higher margins for locally operating firms. The same holds true for imposed import tariffs and diverging industrial standards which are a form of hidden tariffs. Domestic clearing banks like Lloyds and firms protected by border hurdles will tangentially fare better than those depending on export to the EU. Without recourse to EU regulations even carmakers will be able to once again fleece local buyers – at least for the limited time city dwellers will still be willing to buy their cars that is. Mobile phone companies will be happy to reintroduce steep UK roaming charges. Supermarkets medical services and drug companies will fare splendidly as their customers do not have the flexibility to refrain from buying. (For Labour this is all hogwash of course. Because there will be no evil Brussels bureaucrats standing in their way to renationalise whatever is prone to fail.) This brings me to the question of timing. Propagandists of the Great Buying Opportunity are certainly right to point out that the pound has dropped in value and share prices of UK companies are visibly depressed. But so are their European peers. It is impossible to work out if valuations are down because of a perhaps falsely exaggerated Brexit drama as Leavers would have it or rather because world trade has become increasingly brittle with the Chinese economy clearly in retreat the US facing a prolonged government shutdown and a trade war far from abating. We experience a time where some of our chips should be taken off the table. To bet the bank on an outcome which is entirely unpredictable is unwise. The gambling Earl of Sandwich inventor of the eponymous snack should not be our role model. Another not less important point is that valuations are not down for nothing yet in all probability not reflecting the looming chaos in its entirety. Glimmers of hope whenever the risks of crashing out of the EU without a meaningful arrangement seem lessened hardly move the needle. A few ticks up when things look better a few ticks down when British politicians remind us how self-centred and bumptious they are. It is an illustration of investors standing on the sidelines waiting for tail risks to materialise. Investors are hesitant to give their verdict on the final results. They are unwilling to commit to a situation where the outcome is completely unpredictable. It is one thing to waste a few euros on a lottery ticket and quite another to bet the house in the hope that a bunch of blustered buffoons will act responsibly. My hunch is that things will get worse before they get better. I have advised my oldest daughter and her husband who are setting up a new household now in London once their firstborn can travel to rent for a couple of years rather than to buy. Home loans are more burdensome now with banks and FSA hedging for all eventualities down payments substantial and the risk to end up with negative equity – the house being worth less than they will have paid for – significant. Yet if property prices will deteriorate as much as real estate agencies now increasingly fear this could soon be a good buying opportunity. Perhaps not; perhaps prices will continue to creep upwards. But this does not matter. So will their income. And in the meantime they can enjoy a life in comfort unburdened by a killer mortgage. We should approach the UK stock market with similar prudence. It would be misguided to sell all investments now in the fear of Armageddon. There are quite a few solid companies which will not go under and even with their share price subdued will return a decent dividend yield. We may suffer paper losses not a wipeout. The reality of investing is that nobody will ever get the timing right. Over the last 20 years only 20 days made the difference between success and failure. Not having been invested during these days meant having missed out on the biggest stock market gains regardless of the losses such investments had suffered when the internet bubble burst in 2000 and when the markets crashed in 2008. Yet to think that the depressing outlook on the economic prospects of the UK today was nothing but the dawn of a new gold rush is wishful thinking. Let’s keep our powder dry.

Photo: Shutterstock  There’s no beating around the bush – the primary goal behind investing is to make money from hard earned money. If there weren’t any prospects of making money I shudder to think how many investors would be reluctant to be putting money to work or rather at risk. Clearly the purchase price and sale price of an investment (asset) are amongst the most important considerations an investor needs to pay particular attention to as these two factors (amongst others such as income generated from an investment such as a dividend or a coupon payment) will clearly determine the extent of profit or loss on an investment. Therefore market timing is key both when purchasing as well as selling an asset. For those investors who invest for the longer term market timing is important whilst a greater emphasis is placed on market outlook. For the seasoned investors that base investment decisions on short-term market movements the entry point is even more critical. Markets are forever changing; there is always a key event or economic data release which has the potential of derailing market sentiment momentum and direction both on the positive and the negative. This time round it’s the Brexit referendum the outcome of which is expected to result in sizeable market movement once the result becomes official. Asset managers and investors have been closely following and monitors polls which although intended to provide an indication of the outcome of the referendum have in fact increased uncertainty as the percentage of undecided voters remains particularly high with large swings in either direction. This has been also reflected in the recent moves as witnessed by the VIX the volatility index which itself saw large moves – volatility increased when polls indicated Brexit was likely (not a market-friendly outcome let’s face it) only to retrace to lower levels of late when polls indicated that the “remain” vote could possibly have an edge on the 23 June vote. What’s my point really? A couple of weeks ago during an internal strategy meeting one of my colleagues suggested that at this juncture it would be opportune to take a prudent approach towards investing particularly as far as retail clients are concerned. With the outcome of the 23 June vote still uncertain and volatility expected to remain elevated heading towards D-day it was agreed following a thorough analysis to advise against participating in the market given the prevalent market conditions. As stated above market timing and the purchase price is key. Brexit is a market moving event no doubt about that. The strategy team of which I form part of decided that the opportunity cost of missing out (by delaying purchases and risking the market rallies upon a victory by the “remain” camp) is less than the potential downward price movements we could witness should the Brexit vote be successful. It is a kind of way of assisting clients in timing their investments given the volatile and uncertain scenario. True we could get the call wrong but it’s the cost of providing a service in the best interests of our clients. I don’t think we’d be at fault if a client misses out on a 3-4 per cent market rally but I would expect or hope for a tap on the back (or two) if we would have managed to prevent a client from seeing his 1-2 week old investment heavily in the red after merely a few days.

As Britain prepares to leave the EU the country hoping to win the most jobs from London’s financial centre isn’t Germany or France but Poland. While the likes of Frankfurt and Paris are competing for top investment bankers after Brexit Poland has set its sights on mid-tier financial and technical work where salaries may not be astronomical but jobs are far more numerous. Since the country joined the EU in 2004 many Poles have gone to Britain to work; now the government wants to attract more jobs currently based in Britain for Poles to do at home. The Association of Business Service Leaders in Poland is working on projects with seven big financial firms about shifting jobs from London said the association’s managing director Pawel Panczyj. The focus is on middle office functions like risk management and IT. “We are talking with banks insurance institutions and investment funds who want to move their middle office abroad. The main factor behind their decision (now) is Brexit” he told Reuters. Panczyj’s efforts are likely to bear fruit. The regional head of one global investment bank told Reuters that he estimates as many as 20 per cent of jobs at the lender’s London base could eventually be done in Poland. Last year’s referendum when Britons voted for Brexit has forced banks and other financial firms to seek new bases for some operations in a country that will remain in the EU allowing them to continue serving clients in the bloc. They are also under pressure to cut costs as they look at how to reorganise their operations. In some cases this includes work that could still be based in Britain from a regulatory point of view but needs to be done more cheaply than is possible in Europe’s financial capital. Already post-communist Poland has established itself as a major offshoring site for banks with estimates of financial services jobs moved from all Western countries ranging from 35000 to 45000. Credit Suisse and UBS are among those basing large IT and back office administrative operations in the country. Now financial firms are starting to move more sophisticated work there such as risk management and product development taking advantage of a well-educated workforce as well as office space and wages that are cheaper than in most of Europe. Poland’s government expects to attract around 25000-30000 jobs from Britain in the business services sector just this year with many of those in finance Goldman Sachs has 300 people working at its office in Warsaw and is seeking 200 more this year in areas ranging from risk modelling to working on the technology for its fixed income trading systems. It wants candidates with degrees in computer science or chartered financial analyst qualifications according to job advertisements. UBS is looking to hire close to 300 people at its offices in Krakow and Wroclaw according to its website. “At the very beginning banks were hiring young people without (high) qualifications but now they are becoming hubs of high technology” said Brunon Bartkiewicz chief executive of Dutch-controlled Polish lender ING Bank Slaski. The growth of high-tech roles reflects the changing make-up of people working at investment banks. The days of trading floors packed with hundreds of highly-paid dealers are coming to an end with more of their market operations being automated. Banks need fewer people in front-office roles and more in technology as well as in compliance and risk management to deal with tighter regulation since the global financial crisis. That means Frankfurt and Paris are battling over a shrinking pool of front line investment bankers. Officials from the cities’ lobby groups estimate they could each win around 10000 jobs after Brexit. By contrast Poland’s government expects to attract around 25000-30000 jobs from Britain in the business services sector just this year with many of those in finance. The shift to Poland started well before Britain voted to leave the EU but plans to move more jobs have accelerated since the referendum recruiters and consultants say. In central Warsaw BNP Paribas employs 700 people in the Spire office complex supporting the French bank’s fund management business. Ryszard Piskorz who runs BNP Securities Services there says the bank is still expanding but needs to make itself an attractive place to work to fend off competitors who are also recruiting. “Poland is an emerging country and in our sector Poland is coming out as a role expert maybe even challenging Luxembourg as a fund industry centre” said Piskorz. Marta Aserigadu a recruitment consultant at Experis part of Manpower Group said more well-educated Poles are finding it appealing to stay in their home country as banks basing operations there pushe up wages. “There is no need to leave Poland now. The difference in salaries concerns only (recent) graduates. But this difference vanishes very quickly when you take further steps in your career” she said. “These people can reach high-level decisive jobs within global corporations. Staying at home with low Polish costs of living they can start their international careers. There is no need to leave to London and live an immigrant’s life.” The government is pushing to keep this trend going. The ruling Law and Justice party has a protectionist stance against foreign lenders in retail banking but hosting investment banks’ back and middle office operations brings in jobs and taxes without any loss of control over its financial system. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The Premier League is taking Europe by storm this season but the dark clouds of Brexit threaten the English top-flight\\'s long-held position as the richest league in world football. No deal has yet been agreed on the terms under which the United Kingdom will leave the European Union leading to uncertainty among British businesses. Despite its international profile the Premier League is no different particularly with so much of its success across the globe based on its cosmopolitan collection of players coaches and owners. So what could Brexit mean for the Premier League? Weak pound  The value of the British pound has plunged since the referendum result in 2016 making transfer fees paid to European competitors much more expensive. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino referred to the weak pound as one of the reasons his side failed to sign any players in pre-season and compared the impacts of Brexit to a car crash. Football finance experts Deloitte also signalled the weakening of the pound as a contributory factor in Manchester United surrendering top spot in its Football Money League and falling behind Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid. Restrictions on foreign talent In backing the Remain campaign in 2016 the Premier League\\'s former executive chairman Richard Scudamore described leaving the EU as \"incongruous\" to the league\\'s commitment to openness. The global appeal of the competition depends on recruiting the best players no matter where they are from and an end to free movement for European players makes that a more onerous task. \"The Premier League is essentially the hub for a constellation of star brands\" Simon Chadwick professor of sports enterprise at Salford University told AFP. \"Therefore any measures that are adopted to restrict the inward flow of overseas talent could ultimately diminish the Premier League\\'s market positioning thereby undermining its competitive advantage.\" EU national players including many who represent South American and African nations at international level but hold EU passports will have to satisfy much stricter requirements to be handed a work permit. The current system for non-EU players takes into account international appearances the transfer fee proposed wages and recent playing history to determine whether they receive a Governing Body Endorsement (GBE) from the Football Association. Were these restrictions applied across the board marquee signings would not be stopped. However in the ever more competitive transfer market British clubs could be robbed of the opportunity to find hidden gems at the lower end of the market. Chelsea\\'s N\\'Golo Kante and Manchester City\\'s record signing Riyad Mahrez who were both plucked from relative obscurity in France before winning the Premier League for Leicester City have been cited as players who would be unlikely to receive a work permit. In 2016 the BBC calculated that 332 players in the top two tiers of English football and the Scottish Premiership would not meet the criteria if the standards set for non-EU players were applied across the board. Premier League clubs will also lose out on the chance to sign European players before their 18th birthdays unless as seems unlikely the UK remains within the European Economic Area (EEA). FIFA bans all overseas transfers for under-18s but makes an exception for movement within the EEA which has allowed players such as Cesc Fabregas and Paul Pogba to move to England as 16-year-olds. Economic hit Despite lucrative overseas TV deals the success of the Premier League is linked closely to the performance of the British economy. There are already fears that domestic TV rights deals have peaked with broadcasters paying less for matches in 2019-2022 than for the previous three-year period. Guessing the future trajectory of the economy is tricky but if fans are hit in the pocket clubs will lose out on ticket sales and merchandising revenue. Boost for homegrown players?One potential benefit from Brexit for the English national team is that more restrictions on foreign players will mean more opportunities for homegrown talent. Currently England-qualified players account for around 30 percent of starts in the Premier League. However the Premier League argue such restrictions would not help the England team and instead dilute the standard at which English internationals are competing every week. \"There is no evidence that stronger quotas than exist now would have a positive impact on national teams\" the league said in a statement in November.

British MPs voted Wednesday to force Prime Minister Theresa May to quickly set out an alternative plan for Brexit if she loses a crucial vote on her EU withdrawal deal next week in a second parliamentary defeat in 24 hours. The House of Commons voted to reduce the time the government has to outline a \"plan B\" from 21 days to three if as expected lawmakers reject the Brexit agreement in a vote on Tuesday. Members of May\\'s own Conservative party led the revolt amid fears that the current timetable takes Britain too close to crashing out of the European Union on March 29 with no deal at all. It was the second setback in as many days for the prime minister after MPs voted late Tuesday to deny the government certain taxation powers in a no-deal scenario -- another attempt to avoid such an outcome. Speaking to MPs earlier May said: \"The only way to avoid no deal is to vote for the deal.\" But her spokesman added: \"If that were not to take place... we would respond quickly and provide certainty on the way forward.\" Opposition Labour spokesman Keir Starmer said MPs could then start debating alternatives to her plan -- and raised the prospect of delaying Brexit. \"I actually genuinely think we can\\'t do it on March 29 this year. It\\'s simply not viable for so many practical reasons\" he told the Commons. \"So we\\'re going to have to look at what are the available options that realistically are still on the table.\" \\'Cosmetic\\' changes The parliamentary manoeuvres came at the start of five days of debate on the deal May struck with the EU last November which has been strongly opposed from lawmakers on all sides. She set out further clarifications she hopes will win over her own Conservative MPs and Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which props up her government in parliament. The most controversial element of the agreement is the \"backstop\" arrangement which could see Northern Ireland continue to follow certain EU trade rules after Brexit to avoid border checks with Ireland. The government has now offered guarantees to devolved politicians in the province over the operation of the backstop and on the free flow of trade between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. But DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the proposals were \"meaningless and cosmetic\". May is also seeking assurances on the operation of the backstop from European leaders which she hopes to deliver before the vote next week although they say they will not reopen the deal. The prime minister has already postponed the vote once -- in December -- to avoid defeat by MPs but has insisted next week\\'s will go ahead. No deal fears May has warned that if MPs reject her deal Britain would still leave the EU on March 29 with or without any new arrangements. Britain triggered two-year legal withdrawal process in March 2017 that will run its course unless London actively seeks to delay or revoke it. One of her own ministers this week raised the idea of a delay which has been the source of speculation for weeks in Brussels but May has rejected the idea. Both this week\\'s revolts were driven by Conservative MPs seeking to prevent a \"no deal\" scenario which they fear would cause huge economic disruption. Late on Tuesday 303 MPs -- including more than a dozen former Conservative ministers -- voted to restrict the government\\'s taxation powers in a \"no deal\" scenario against 296 who backed May. The government said it was an \"inconvenience\" but would not stop its preparations for leaving the EU. Wednesday\\'s amendment which passed by 308 votes to 297 has more weight. It states that if May loses the vote next week she must explain her next steps within three parliamentary sitting days -- by the latest Monday January 21. She would then have a further seven days to put a motion to the House of Commons which MPs could amend to try to direct the government\\'s strategy. There was a major row in the Commons over whether Wednesday\\'s amendment could even be put to a vote with Speaker John Bercow apparently disregarding the advice of his own clerk that it could not. Several Conservative MPs accused Bercow of being biased and there was speculation of an attempt to remove him from his post. Labour has said it will seek a confidence vote in the government if it loses next week and is also likely to press for a general election. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

As an analysis of what has gone wrong with Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union John Vassallo’s simplistic biased ill-informed and insulting diatribe of March 3 (‘Oldest Democracy’ in Action) adds nothing positive to this important debate. Presumably he is aware that the Greek city-state of Athens is credited with being the oldest democracy – “the cradle of democracy”? Can he really believe his own assertion that the over-mighty European Commission the President of the EU Council of Ministers and the European Parliament are truly exemplars of representative democracy? Vassallo who was briefly accredited as ambassador to the European Community some 10 years before Malta joined the European Union – but signs himself as “a former ambassador of Malta to the EU” –\\xa0 won’t let the facts get in the way of his prejudices in taking a wild and inaccurate swing at Britain and its institutions. He is right about one thing: the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU has been an unmitigated shambles. But he is wrong in blaming it on Britain’s democratic institutions or its first-past-the-post electoral system. The last 32 months have been essentially about the poverty of leadership in the United Kingdom not its vibrant representative democracy. The Brexit process has exposed the dearth of leadership of both main parties as not up to the task. The United Kingdom has been divided into two warring camps in a debate conducted in the most uncivil terms. The respect for truth has been notable by its absence. The vote for Brexit in June 2016 was a mutiny a vote against the established authority not a strategy for the future. The consequences have been to deepen polarisation in Britain leaving no coherent and united government or Opposition stance on the best withdrawal option and no House of Commons majority in favour of anything. Theresa May actuated Article 50 with no pre-negotiation and no inkling where it might end up But the essence of the problem is that the negotiation to leave the European Union has been handled poorly compounded by cack-handed leadership. Theresa May’s government – grossly weakened by an ill-judged election – chose to trigger Article 50 which started the process of leaving the European Union even though it had no real notion of how it would then proceed. May actuated Article 50 with no pre-negotiation and no inkling where it might end up. Secondly she compounded matters by laying down “red lines” which further inhibited her room for manoeuvre in an extremely complex negotiation. And thirdly the Prime Minister signed up to a withdrawal agreement that endorsed the Irish backstop and no exit from the customs union without the permission of the European Union. She is currently – amidst Tory in-fighting – trying to change this. With time running down Mrs May has walked into a problem with the Northern Irish border which may well prove to be insoluble. In all my 25 years as a civil servant in Whitehall I have never known a less impressive group of government ministers. In ordinary political times in Britain incompetent government has at least been mitigated by the presence of an Opposition that was a viable administration-in-waiting. One has to go back 40 years to recall when there was one as unappealing and dangerous as Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party. At a time crying out for clarity it is still almost impossible to tell what the Labour position on Brexit might be. This abysmal failure of political leadership has immediate consequences. The prime impact is that with only 19 days until March 29 Britain might be on the cusp of a damaging departure from the European Union without a withdrawal agreement in place leading to serious administrative economic and social consequences – a crisis which would be entirely home-grown and wholly self-inflicted. If a no-deal Brexit can be avoided both the European Union and the United Kingdom need to be thinking strategically about the long-term relationship each wants. For both each will be its most important economic and security partner in this hemisphere. The trade negotiations ahead will be vastly more complex and difficult than the withdrawal agreement the United Kingdom has just been through. A very different style of British leadership will be needed throughout the domestic UK debates in the next even more crucial phase if a successful long-term EU/UK trade and security relationship is to be established.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The British government said on Thursday its key piece of Brexit legislation would return to the House of Commons in a matter of weeks the next stage in what is expected to be a major test of Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s authority. The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill is central to the government\\'s Brexit plan repealing the laws that made Britain an EU member and transposing existing EU law into British law. The House of Lords has inflicted 15 defeats on the legislation \"I aim to bring back the very important Brexit legislation within weeks\" said Andrea Leadsom leader of the House of Commons without giving a specific date. May who has struggled to unite the government and parliament behind her vision of Brexit has said Britain will leave the European Union’s single market and customs union after it quits the bloc next March. Britain\\'s upper house of parliament the House of Lords has inflicted 15 defeats on the legislation including on core Brexit issues such as whether Britain should leave the EU\\'s single market and customs union. The government will seek to overturn these amendments when the legislation returns to the lower House of Commons. But there are concerns that the government may be defeated by pro-European rebels in May\\'s Conservative Party on whether Britain should leave the customs union that could force her into a damaging policy U-turn. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain’s EU referendum could push up credit costs and weaken sterling more the Bank of England warned yesterday as it moved to bolster banks’ risk buffers and slow a boom in lending to landlords. The central bank said the outlook for financial stability had worsened since its last report in November saying a rebound in Chinese lending was “concerning” and that June 23’s vote on leaving the EU was now the biggest domestic risk. BoE governor Mark Carney came under fire from some pro-Brexit lawmakers earlier this month for exaggerating the dangers of leaving the EU. The BoE’s Financial Policy Committee said yesterday that “heightened and prolonged uncertainty... could lead to a further depreciation of sterling and affect the cost… of financing for a broad range of UK borrowers.” Sterling has fallen to a seven-year low against the dollar since the start of the year. While much of the BoE’s concern about Brexit was familiar less expected was its decision to tighten credit checks on landlords and move ahead with a disputed plan to vary the size of banks’ risk buffers over the economic cycle. The immediate impact of both measures is likely to be modest but they indicate a policy direction and may have a greater effect over time if the bank expands them. Buy-to-let lending has boomed in Britain in recent years and is now worth £200 billion. Prime Minister David Cameron’s government has been keen to boost individual home ownership and is raising taxes on the sector leading the BoE to fear that banks’ plans to raise gross lending to landlords by 20 per cent a year might come at the cost of credit standards. As a result the BoE has recommended banks ensure they take new tax rules into account when assessing loan applications check landlords’ incomes properly and ensure rental income will be enough to cover a mortgage rate of at least 5.5 per cent. The BoE said most lenders already had similar rules but that it expected enforcing the rules universally would reduce the number of mortgage approvals in three years’ time by 10-20 per cent compared with doing nothing. “It’s timid” Capital Economics’s Paul Hollingsworth said adding much of the gross lending growth was existing landlords switching mortgages rather than new lending. “They are doing a lot of red flag waving rather than taking some serious action.” The Council for Mortgage Lenders said the measures did not appear to curtail existing market practices. Tougher rules may come later however if finance minister George Osborne follows through with plans to give the BoE more fine-grained powers over buy-to-let mortgage terms similar to powers it has already used on residential mortgages. The BoE also said it would start to raise the new cyclical element of its capital framework which rises and falls as the risk of imprudent lending changes over the business cycle after policymakers failed to reach agreement in December. This new buffer sits on top of the minimum and is built up in good times to stop credit supply becoming too frothy and tapped when the economy weakens and some loans turn sour. Banks will have to hold a 0.5 per cent counter-cyclical buffer by the end of March 2017. That is equivalent to a relatively modest £5 billion for the banking system as a whole and halfway towards its neutral level of one per cent. Moreover for larger banks the bulk of the increase to 0.5 per cent will be cancelled out by a cut in another capital requirement. “While a big symbolic step there is unlikely to be a large impact” HSBC economist Simon Wells said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo:\\u2008Darrin\\u2008Zammit Lupi  Influence: The UK’s departure will deal a blow to Malta’s leverage on major political decisions being taken in Brussels former EU Commissioner Tonio Borg and Malta’s former Permanent Representative to the EU Richard Cachia Caruana believe. Malta will no longer be able to rely on Britain’s support on issues such as taxation social security changes and working time restrictions thus weakening our voice in these areas. Tourism: If sterling devalues against the euro the major impact on Malta is likely to be a decline in UK tourists says economist Lino Briguglio echoing the views of many. A devaluation would make a holiday in Malta more expensive for Britons. However former prime minister and MEP Alfred Sant believes this particular crisis should ease once the uncertainties subside. He also points out that tourism has been performing strongly due to the crisis faced by Malta’s competitors and for the time being it does look like this situation will change. Exports: If the British economy goes through a recession or slow-down it would push down UK consumption which in turn could hit Maltese exports (goods and services) to the UK Prof. Briguglio cautions. Students: Those wanting to further their studies in the UK will have to fork out higher fees as they would no longer be considered on par with British students which is the case now thanks to EU membership. Pensions: Maltese nationals who receive a UK pension in sterling may lose a significant chunk of their allowance if the pound fails to recover against the euro. Potential investment: Major companies which had set up base in the UK as a gateway to reach the EU’s 508 million consumers might decide to relocate to other Member States. Malta’s attractive tax regime coupled with the fact that it is the only Member State apart from Ireland where English is an official language might give it an edge over other competitors. However Prof. Briguglio says that this would not apply to the manufacturing industry due to higher transport costs Malta’s small domestic market and its lack of natural resources. Dr Sant was even more sceptical. While doubting if UK companies would seek to relocate at all he believes they would rather choose locations closer to the geographic heart of the EU like the Czech Republic. Imports from UK: The sharp drop in sterling against the euro means more spending power for those visiting the UK or making online purchases from British suppliers Prof. Briguglio believes. However this will largely depend on exchange rate fluctuations which over a period of time should stabilise Dr Sant pointed out.  The first step will be for the UK to invoke Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union which regulates the departure of any Member State. However this might not happen till October by which time the ruling Conservative Party would have elected a new leader in the wake of David Cameron’s announcement that he does not want to be the one to lead Brexit negotiations. Once this hurdle is cleared exit negotiations (which shall take no more than two years) would begin. The agreement would then be put to the vote before the 27 EU leaders in the European Council. It would require approval from at least 20 countries with 65 per cent of the EU population prior to being ratified by the European Parliament. If no agreement is reached within two years EU treaties would cease to apply to the UK which will be out of the bloc. Moreover the UK Parliament must then repeal the 1972 European Communities Act. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Global equity prices rattled by worries about the US presidential election steadied yesterday after a UK court ruled that the British Parliament must approve a government decision to trigger Brexit lifting the pound to a three-week high. US Treasury prices slipped after the Bank of England scrapped plans to cut interest rates and projected higher inflation while oil prices remained weak. “The market is having a bit of a rethink about the slide in the past few days and the UK court decision this morning is also lifting equities a little bit” said Michael Baughen global investment specialist at JP Morgan Private Bank in Tampa. The court decision which will be appealed in early December appeared to offer hope to investors who worry Prime Minister Theresa May's Cabinet is set on a “hard” exit from the EU. The sterling topped $1.24 for the first time in three weeks. Tension in markets rattled this week by a tightening race between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump eased a little after the UK court ruling. MSCI's 47-country “All World” index was flat supported by a slightly higher Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 35.2 points or 0.2 per cent to 17994.84 the S&P 500 gained 2.82 points or 0.13 per cent to 2100.76 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.03 points or 0.1 per cent to 5100.54. “Any news that might indicate that Brexit is not necessarily a certainty or could be delayed is going to be positive for the pound and the markets in general” said John De Clue chief investment officer The Private Client Reserve of US Bank in Minneapolis. Facebook shares fell as much as 5.5 per cent and were the biggest drag on the S&P and the Nasdaq a day after the social media giant warned that revenue growth would slow this quarter. European shares looked set to end an eight-day losing streak on solid corporate results. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.19 per cent at 1310.90. In bond markets US Treasury prices dipped with long-dated bonds underperforming. The Bank of England scrapped plans to cut interest rates and indicated that inflation is likely to rise further. It ramped up its forecasts for growth and predicted that inflation would jump to 2.7 per cent this time next year nearly triple its current level. Benchmark 10-year notes were down 4/32 in price to yield 1.81 per cent up from 1.80 per cent late on Wednesday. The US dollar stabilised from multi-week lows against a basket of major currencies on reduced US election fears after a New York Times/CBS a poll showed Clinton maintained a narrow lead over Trump. The dollar index which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies was still down 0.11 per cent on the day at 97.295. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo:\\u2008Michael Candelori/Shutterstock.com  Many parallels are being drawn bet\\xadween the populisms now resurgent in Europe and those in the US. The similarities are interesting so is the timing as is the foreign power – Russia – sometimes suspected of aiding them all. However the differences in dynamic are also worth underlining. They might help us understand the dynamics in current Maltese politics better. For reasons of space and simplicity let’s look only at the significant differences between Donald Trump’s America and the UK’s Brexit predicament. There are two major ones. First there are the respective patterns of conflicts and convergence of interests. You would think that the stark contrast lies between Trump’s evident conflict of interests and the probity of major politicians in the UK. The latter subject themselves to scrutiny and are under a strict obligation to declare their interests. Trump has refused to disclose his tax records and to divest himself in any proper sense of his business interests. His son-in-law Jared Kushner faces important questions about his own potential conflicts. Yet politically the experience in each country is the reverse of what you’d expect. It is in Theresa May’s UK that everyone feels that every version of Brexit that is being broached is palatable only to a minority. The idea of a second referendum is also divisive. You could say that the UK is racked by an irresolvable set of conflicts of interest where every possible solution imaginable is seen to be against the national interest. It either undermines democracy by overriding the decision taken two years ago or else by satisfying only a minority today. The conflicts of interest are reflected accurately in the House of Commons where no solution – not the ‘Chequers plan’ nor the no-deal Brexit nor a customs union nor anything else – can summon a majority of votes in Parliament. In the US Trump has managed to create a convergence of interests between his voters and himself that obscures his own unclear business interests. It’s not that his voters are stupid. It’s that Trump has managed to persuade his voters that what matters is not his interests but the fact that he takes care of theirs. He assures social conservatives that he will put their ideologues on the Supreme Court (and other courts); the working class that he is ready to pick trade wars on their behalf never mind the niceties; the rich that he will cut their taxes; the middle class that he will cut back on government regulations that make their cars more expensive and the State more intrusive. Second there is the nature of the electorate. In the UK the Brexit referendum was held at a time when many voters were not motivated to inform themselves properly. As they themselves admit they never realised that the vote to leave the EU could affect the border with Ireland as well as the ease with which they could travel in Europe with their pets. It is evident that the project will ruin entire neighbourhoods and cheat ordinary families of time and money they have invested in building a home Now however you could say that the wrangling over Brexit has transformed the electorate into a super-motivated one. All are much clearer about what their respective interests are. The tragedy for Theresa May is that her premiership has occurred at a time when the electorate is highly motivated to pay attention but there is nothing that seems compelling or in the national interest to pay attention to. Hence the withering scorn with which she is regarded. The electorate in Trump’s America is more variegated. He won the election thanks to a segment of the voters that was disenchanted if not demotivated by Hillary Clinton. It could well also be that that vote was also depressed by fake news carefully targeted to make voters cynical about the entire process. Despite the political turmoil in the US right now over the confirmation hearings surrounding Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court it is not clear that the country has actually shifted in its attitudes from the country that voted in 2016. True many Democrats who abstained from voting in the presidential election because of disenchantment with Hillary Clinton have now been charged up both by the shift to the left by the Democrats and by what they see as a threat to abortion rights. But it remains to be seen whether the new activists and highly motivated voters outnumber the segment of the newly disenchanted who are truly dismayed not just at the shabby behaviour of Trump but also of the mainstream media the national security apparatus and the uncompromisingly partisan Congress. The comparison might seem abstract but it helps understand the dynamics of populism in Malta. Comparisons with the UK are uninteresting because the contrast is too great. Unlike the UK and like the US Malta is currently undergoing a period where there are blatant conflicts of interest concerning certain ministers and senior public officials. But Joseph Muscat’s government has so far made such conflicts appear irrelevant to the convergence of interests created by the trickle-down economics of say the passport scheme or the effective dismantling of sustainable development plans. It is not just in this that we resemble the US much more than the UK. It is also in the nature of the electorate where to the highly motivated segments of activists there needs to be added the increasingly significant segment of those who have lost faith in it. How long the situation will last however cannot be judged using the US for comparison. Size and scale make the dynamics of change different. The first sign to watch out for has to be the medium-term impact of the mega project approved for the db Group. What makes this different from other controversial projects pushed by the Muscat government is that for the first time it is no longer possible to believe that here is a project that harnesses a convergence of interests. It is evident that the project will ruin entire neighbourhoods and cheat ordinary families of time and money they have invested in building a home and a neighbourhood. It is also evident that the project has moved some people from the indifferent electorate to the motivated segment. We still have to see whether the shift will remain regional or whether it will spread. Will the ease and shamelessness with which the project was approved affect other people who think their neighbourhoods too could be next? I don’t know. But I do know it’s the space to keep watching. ranierfsadni@europe.com This is a Times of Malta print opinion piece \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

US presidential candidate Donald Trump thrust himself into the heart of Britain\\'s vote to leave the European Union calling it a \"great\" development and drawing parallels to his own insurgent campaign. In Scotland to reopen a golf resort he owns the wealthy New York businessman wasted no time interpreting the outcome of the \"Brexit\" vote as an example of a global uprising against the established order. It\\'s an argument he said fit in with his own campaign to shake up Washington by renegotiating free trade deals and stopping illegal immigration. \"People want to take their country back. They want to have independence in a sense. You see it with Europe all over Europe\" Trump 70 the presumptive Republican nominee told a news conference at the Trump Turnberry golf course. People want to take their country back. They want to have independence in a sense He said the economic shock from the vote would ebb over time and that more European countries might want to break with the 28-nation European Union. Americans he said would have a chance \"to re-declare their independence\" and \"reject today\\'s rule by the global elite\" when they vote on Nov. 8. \"So I think you\\'re going to have this happen more and more. I really believe that and I think that it\\'s happening in the United States. It\\'s happening by the fact that I\\'ve done so well in the polls\" he said. Trump\\'s rival Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton said in a statement: \"This time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm steady experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans\\' pocketbooks and livelihoods to support our friends and allies to stand up to our adversaries and to defend our interests. \"It also underscores the need for us to pull together to solve our challenges as a country not tear each other down\" said Clinton 68 a former U.S. secretary of state who had openly favored Britain\\'s remaining in the EU. More than half a million Britons signed a petition earlier this year to bar Trump from entering Britain where he has business interests in response to his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. British lawmakers decided against a ban as a violation of free speech. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

He had already faced calls in the European Parliament to give up the sensitive financial services portfolio which will be a focus of interest in exit negotiations between Brussels and London. He has had a key role in setting regulations that give Britain\\'s huge banking sector access to euro zone markets. As long as Britain remains an EU member it will continue to have a seat on the 28-strong Commission giving Cameron or more likely his successor a right to nominate another commissioner whose appointment would be subject to EU parliamentary approval. The distribution of portfolios in the Commission is in the gift of its president former Luxembourg premier Juncker in negotiation with the leader of the member state nominating their commissioner. Hill\\'s appointment to the finance job in 2014 was seen as a peace offering from Juncker to Cameron who had tried to block the Commission president\\'s own appointment that year. It was viewed with some suspicion by euro zone bankers keen to challenge London\\'s dominance as Europe\\'s financial capital. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit minister David Davis resigned within hours of each other denouncing a plan that the cabinet had only agreed on Friday and fuelling speculation that May could face a leadership challenge. However at a meeting with her Conservative Party lawmakers she was cheered and applauded by many as she warned them that internal squabbling could pave the way for socialist opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to take power instead. After the meeting senior lawmakers said they did not expect the prime minister to face a vote of no confidence although some Conservatives were still saying that she should go. May\\'s proposals for a future EU relationship after Britain departs from the bloc next March had taken two-years of internal government wrangling to agree but within 48 hours Johnson and Davis had resigned saying they could not back the plans. Three junior ministers also quit their posts. Boris Johnson \"Brexit should be about opportunity and hope\" Johnson said in a scathing resignation letter that was echoed in headlines in a number of Britain\\'s national newspapers. \"That dream is dying suffocated by needless self-doubt.\" May having finally signalled her vision for Brexit spent two hours in parliament defiantly defending the plans and called for Brussels to engage fully or risk the damaging prospect of Britain leaving the bloc with no deal in place. \"I\\'ve listened to every possible idea and every possible version of Brexit. This is the right Brexit\" she said. May\\'s personal authority was badly damaged after she called a snap election last year to strengthen her hand in Brexit talks but instead she lost her parliamentary majority meaning she has to rely on a small Northern Irish party to govern. While other senior ministers rallied round her after the resignations which left Westminster reeling on Monday rumblings of discontent among rank and file lawmakers remained. The Sun Britain\\'s biggest-selling newspaper said there had been \"blunder after blunder\" by May. \"Now there is chaos\" the paper said in its editorial. \"Brussels must not mistakenly conclude as EU Council chief Donald Tusk hinted that one more push will destroy Brexit. Brexit must and will happen.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Shutterstock  British actors Benedict Cumberbatch Keira Knightley Chiwetel Ejiofor and Helena Bonham Carter are among more than 250 celebrities from the arts world who have signed a letter urging Britons to vote to remain in the European Union. Some of Britain\\'s best-known artists musicians and writers are also signatories to the letter in the Guardian newspaper that warns of the country becoming \"an outsider shouting from the wings\" if Britons vote to leave the EU in a June 23 referendum. \"Britain is not just stronger in Europe it is more imaginative and more creative ... Our global creative success would be severely weakened by walking away\" they said. The letter was coordinated by \"Stronger In\" the official campaign to persuade voters to stay in the EU that is also backed by Prime Minister David Cameron. Cameron\\'s governing Conservative Party is deeply split over the issue. Other signatories to the letter include singer Paloma Faith designer Vivienne Westwood and writer John Le Carre. The move by \"Stronger In\" is likely to be seen as an attempt to broaden the EU debate beyond economics and immigration.

David Beckham has come out in favour of staying in the EU saying that an international crop of players including Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and Frenchman Eric Cantona made Manchester United great. But other famous faces including fellow footballer Sol Campbell and Monty Python star John Cleese have thrown their support behind the Brexit campaign. Here is a list of celebrities who have come out either in support or against staying in the EU. James Bond actor Daniel Craig has added his support to the Remain campaign. The 007 star was pictured wearing a vote Remain t-shirt with the words “No man is an island. No country by itself” emblazoned across it in a picture tweeted on the Stronger In account. Darts legend Bobby George is better known for his love of gold jewellery than his political views but he has declared he is backing Remain. Tweeting his support he said: “If the Capt says in I’m in. It’s up to you what you do but make sure you have your vote on Thursday @David_Cameron”. Adventurer and TV presenter Bear Grylls said he spoke “from the heart” in backing the EU. He said: “At such a time for the UK to retreat run and cut ourselves loose from Europe when there are so many challenges on our doorstep to me just doesn’t feel either courageous or kind. Europe has many flaws but I also believe the way to help resolve many of those tough issues is from within... I have never been a good quitter and I am so proud of the UK and our values: tolerance kindness respect courage and resilience. This is why I want us to stay together and remain in Europe.” J.K. Rowling. Photos: Shutterstock Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling has come out in support of the Remain campaign and suggested that “racists and bigots” are directing parts of the Leave campaign. She said: “For some of us that fact alone is enough to give us pause. The picture of Nigel Farage standing in front of a poster showing a winding line of Syrian refugees captioned ‘Breaking Point’ is as countless people have already pointed out an almost exact duplicate of propaganda used by the Nazis.” Benedict Cumberbatch and Patrick Stewart led more than 280 figures from the arts world that backed a vote to stay. An open letter pledging support for Remain was also signed by music stars Hot Chip alt-J and Paloma Faith authors Hilary Mantel and John le Carré and fashion designer Vivienne Westwood. Idris Elba made his pro-EU views clear on Twitter. In a tweet that included a link to a video of Alex Salmond saying he was fed up with immigrants being portrayed negatively the Luther actor wrote: ‘’My parents immigrated to the UK worked hard and made a contribution... me... on that basis vote in.’’ Helena Bonham-Carter Helena Bonham-Carter backed Remain saying: ‘’I feel European but I also feel we can be British and be part of Europe without it impinging on our sense of identity.’’ Physicist Stephen Hawking has come out in favour of staying saying that ‘’progress comes from cooperation’’. He said: ‘’By working together in Europe we make our economy stronger and we give ourselves more influence in the world and we provide future opportunities for young people.’’ Game of Thrones actors Daniel Portman who stars as Podrick Payne in the fantasy series and Kate Dickie who played Lysa Arryn are two of more than 80 prominent members of Scotland’s creative sector who argue that Europe has benefitted the country artistically and culturally. Monty Python star John Cleese signalled he will vote to leave the EU when he tweeted: “If I thought there was any chance of major reform in the EU I’d vote to stay in. But there isn’t. Sad.’’ John Cleese Actor Michael Caine said he is a reluctant Leaver. He said: ‘’I don’t know what to vote for. Both are scary. To me you’ve now got in Europe a sort of government-by-proxy of everybody who has now got carried away. Unless there are extremely significant changes we should get out.’’ David Bailey was one of a number of personalities who loaned their face to a poster urging people to stay in the European Economic Community during the 1975 referendum campaign. But a spokeswoman for Britain’s most famous photographer told the Press Association he is going to vote for Brexit. Cricketer Ian Botham appeared with former mayor of London Boris Johnson at a Vote Leave event in Chester-le-Street County Durham. Botham said he felt power has been ‘’eroded by Brussels’’ adding: ‘’I think hang on enough’s enough.’’ Former England international football star Sol Campbell said he is backing Brexit so that young British sporting talent would be nurtured and given greater opportunities at British clubs. He said: ‘’I’m looking at the sporting side – how youngsters aren’t getting the opportunities at some of the big clubs and some of the big clubs are bringing in youngsters from 14 15 16 and becoming homegrown which is pushing some of our youngsters out.’’ \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

On December 9 the negotiators of the EU and the UK government published a report aligning their positions on EEA citizens post-Brexit. It follows the UK government’s technical note in November detailing its proposals for UK resident EU citizens including Maltese citizens and their family members who wish to remain in the UK after the UK leaves the EU. In this article we address what the proposals mean for Maltese nationals in the UK and for those who are looking to move to the UK in the near future. As Malta is a member of the EEA you are entitled to visit the UK for a period of up to three months without any formalities. Should you wish to remain in the UK for more than three months you will need to be employed self-employed a student or self-sufficient (the latter two are required to have comprehensive medical insurance at all times). This is referred to as “exercising your treaty rights”. You are also able to bring your family members to the UK whether or not they are Maltese or EEA citizens. Once you have completed a five-year period of continuous residence (in exercise of your treaty rights) you automatically acquire permanent residence status in the UK.\\xa0 Maltese citizens and their family members will continue to enjoy the rights they have under the EU treaties. Permanent residence is an immigration right granted to EU citizens under the UK’s implementation of EU law. Broadly permanent residence mirrors the right granted to non-EU citizens which is referred to as “indefinite leave to remain in the UK”. As permanent residence is acquired automatically you are not required to apply to the Home Office to get it. However you can apply for a document certifying that you have it should you wish. Historically few EU citizens living in the UK made this application but since the referendum it is widely accepted that it is sensible for EU citizens who qualify to apply for a certificate as it is the best way to prove that they have acquired permanent residence. Under current law once a person has permanent residence they are entitled to live in the UK indefinitely irrespective of whether they are exercising treaty rights. The UK Prime Minister has stated that the UK’s membership of the EU will end at 11pm GMT on March 29 2019 and from this point the UK will no longer be bound by the EU directive which created permanent residence. The UK government has proposed that permanent residence will be replaced by “settled status”. Settled status will be similar to permanent residence. It will allow you to live and work in the UK indefinitely. If you hold permanent residence at the exit date and you wish to retain the rights associated with it you will need to make an application to swap your permanent residence for settled status after the exit date. We do not yet know whether EU citizens arriving in the UK following Brexit will be able to apply for settled status although this is likely to form part of the next stage of negotiations. To help you understand the current state of play and how it will impact you as a Maltese national we have identified four scenarios: Once a person has permanent residence they are entitled to live in the UK indefinitely irrespective of whether they are exercising treaty rights 1. Maltese nationals who have been residing in the UK for five continuous years prior to the exit date. If you fall in this category you will be guaranteed settled status in the UK. If your family members join you in the UK before the UK leaves the EU current EU law will apply and they will be able to apply for settled status after five years’ continuous residence. If they arrive after the UK leaves the EU they will be subject to the same rules as family members joining British citizens under domestic law which are not as generous. 2. Maltese nationals who arrive before the exit date but have not completed five years continuous UK residence by the exit date. If you fall in this category you will be able to continue to live and work in the UK during the two-year transition period without having to apply for permission. The UK government intends to have a transition period of up to two years that will start from the exit date. If you wish to continue to live in the UK after March 29 2021 you will need to apply to the Home Office for a temporary residence permit within the transition period. The permit will last for up to five years and will enable you to continue lawfully living and working in the UK until you meet the five-year threshold to apply for settled status. 3. Maltese nationals who arrive after the exit date. If you fall in this category you will still be able to live and work in the UK during the transition period without having to apply for any permission. At the end of the transition period you will need to apply for a visa or residence in accordance with UK domestic immigration rules which will be in place at the time. 4. Maltese nationals who are currently living in the UK without exercising their treaty rights. If you fall in this category then you may be here in breach of immigration rules. This may have a detrimental effect on your ability to enter or live in the UK in the future. It is our view that Maltese citizens who have met the criteria for permanent residence should consider applying to the Home Office for the permanent residence card even if strictly speaking it is not yet legally necessary. Holding a card is the best way to evidence your permanent residence status and eventually obtain settled status. It has become a mantra of the Brexit negotiation that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. If you do not meet the requirements for permanent residence we suggest that you take “a wait and see” approach but ensure that you are meeting the current rules on UK residence under the EU directive. For example we still recommend that you take out private medical insurance if you are a student or a self-sufficient person. British citizenship provides you with certainty that you may live in the UK permanently regardless of what deal is finally agreed between the UK and the EU and/or what the UK immigration law says post-Brexit. It also ensures your right to live in the UK will not be lost if you leave the UK for two years or five years as provided under the joint report. If you qualify for citizenship you should therefore consider applying but before making an application you should consider carefully what the legal or tax implications will be for you.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Friday he was fully focused on making Brexit negotiations a success and hoped for a deal in November. The European Union\\'s Brexit negotiators see a divorce deal with Britain as \"very close\" diplomatic sources have told Reuters signalling that a compromise might be in the making on the most contentious issue of the future Irish border. \"Negotiations are not easy because we also have to be critical that we receive different signals from London\" Juncker said addressing the Austrian parliament. \"There is a polyphonic chorus at the level of the British cabinet and we try to arrange the pieces ... so that they become a melody\" he said. He said he hoped the European Council later this month would make \"enough progress\" that \"we can see it through in November\". In the meantime\\xa0EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he stressed the need for a binding deal to avoid a disruptive EU border for Northern Ireland when he met leading politicians from the British province on Friday. He tweeted that he had met leaders or deputy leaders from four parties \"to discuss the ongoing Brexit negotiations and the importance of a legally operative backstop for Northern Ireland\". Barnier is due to meet senior figures from the biggest party the Democratic Unionists on Tuesday. The DUP allies of British Prime Minister Theresa May strongly oppose Barnier\\'s current proposals for a \"backstop\" that would apply EU rules to Northern Ireland but not to the British mainland in the event that London and Brussels fail to agree a post-Brexit free trade deal that would ensure minimal border checks in Ireland. Britain and the EU are trying to push the divorce deal as well as an agreement on post-Brexit relations in time for two leaders\\' summits scheduled for October 17-18 and November 17-18. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British MPs on Wednesday backed Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s newly-revised plan for leaving the European Union -- which raises the possibility of delaying Brexit. Lawmakers approved a three-step plan unveiled by the embattled leader on Tuesday that would give her more time to renegotiate an agreement struck with the bloc last year. If she fails to win MPs\\' support for her reworked deal by March 12 they will then vote on March 13 and 14 on leaving the EU as scheduled on March 29 without an agreement -- or delaying Brexit. Lawmakers showed overwhelming support for the proposal\\xa0approving by 520 votes to 20 an amendment tabled by Labour former minister Yvette Cooper seeking to bind May to the timeframe.\\xa0 MPs also voted on several other amendments from backbenchers including approving without a vote Conservative Alberto Costa\\'s stipulation that May must seek a treaty on citizens\\' rights after Brexit under any scenario. Costa quit his junior government post an unpaid role as parliamentary private secretary in the Scotland Office earlier Wednesday in order to bring the amendment -- which the government then backed. Meanwhile an amendment put forward by Labour main opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn calling on the government to adopt Labour\\'s preferred Brexit position was comfortably defeated. The motion instructing the government to negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU and close alignment to the single market was beaten by 323 votes to 240. Corbyn announced Monday that Labour would support a second Brexit referendum if the amendment was defeated. A motion from the Scottish nationalists requiring Prime Minister Theresa May to rule out immediately a no-deal Brexit \"under any and all circumstances\" and regardless of exit date was beaten by 324 votes to 288.\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo:\\u2008Matthew Mirabelli  Banks have denied changing procedures for British expats wanting to open accounts or obtain loans following Brexit. Expats who spoke to this newspaper said they were asked for extra documentation or refused a loan because of the Brexit referendum result. The referendum which sparked a political meltdown raised several questions about the impact of a Brexit on Maltese living in the UK and British expats in Malta. In one case a person who owns property here applied for a car loan and provided payslips and their ID card as requested before the referendum took place. A couple of days following the referendum result he was told the loan was refused because of the Brexit result. In another case a person who wanted to open an account to receive their salary was initially given the go ahead but was then told an ID or residency card was needed because of Brexit. On a case-by-case basis the bank could ask for additional documentation before establishing a new relationship Expats who spoke to this newspaper said that previously they could open a bank account with just a passport. The newspaper contacted three of the main banks enquiring about any change in policies following the UK referendum. Bank of Valletta plc said its policies and procedures – both for deposit accounts and financing – were not impacted by the Brexit vote and had remained unchanged. Still the procedure of opening accounts was governed by the bank’s customer acceptance policy and on a case-by-case basis the bank could ask for additional documentation before establishing a new relationship as part of its due diligence process a spokesman said. For Banif Bank Malta lending is regulated by internal policies which are applicable to all parties irrespective of nationality. No changes in any lending criteria were made in the run-up to or after the Brexit referendum a spokesman said. Asked whether British clients needed to provide additional documentation the spokesman said the criteria for foreigners applied to UK citizens too. The result of the Brexit referendum was not one of the factors taken into consideration in the evaluation of credit requests he pointed out. A Briton asking to open an account to start depositing a salary would be asked for the same documentation as would any other foreign national. An HSBC Bank Malta spokesman insisted that the bank had not changed its approach towards British residents following the result of the referendum adding it was business as usual. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  A majority of businesses are yet to change their strategic planning due to Britain’s decision to leave the European Union a survey of chief financial officers showed. Big businesses were vocal in the run-up to the referendum in June 2016 that a vote to leave the EU could hit investment and the labour market with uncertainty lingering over sectors from financial services to the car industry.\\xa0 However the Thomson Reuters survey of 200 CFOs across Britain and Europe found that 69 per cent of businesses had not seen an impact from the vote for Brexit on their strategic planning. “The results suggest a relatively muted response from business so far – not the knee-jerk reaction that some expected” said Laurence Kiddle managing director for the EMEA Tax & Accounting business of Thomson Reuters. A relatively muted response from business so far Only 12 per cent of CFOs had investigated moving operations out of Britain and while 34 per cent said that they anticipated the number of employees in the UK decreasing only 19 per cent said that they planned to relocate staff as a result of Brexit. Some are changing their plans in response to Brexit already with 21 per cent of all CFOs saying they had have held off from expanding in the UK as a result of the vote. Earlier this month Royal Bank of Scotland said it will move 150 jobs to Amsterdam due to Brexit. However the survey suggests that CFOs are on average so far sanguine about Britain’s departure from the bloc and some businesses have highlighted the opportunities for firms in Brexit. Swiss private bank Julius Baer is opening three new UK offices as it looks to bank for wealthy residents spooked by the vote while on Wednesday Amazon ramped up its hiring in Britain yet again despite Brexit. The survey comes after Britain’s Brexit strategy was thrown into question by a botched election gamble in June by British Prime Minister Theresa May who called an early vote to strengthen her hand heading into negotiations only to see her Conservative party lose their majority. Confidence among the CFOs in May’s ability to generate a positive deal for business is just 3.5 out of 10 the survey shows. Pro-Brexit trade minister Liam Fox commands the least confidence among senior British figures scoring just 3.2. The CFOs place most trust in Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney who score eight and 8.6 out of 10 respectively. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned British counterpart Theresa May on Friday that there could be \"no tweaks\" to the Brexit deal that the parliament in London rejected this week. Rutte one of several EU leaders who spoke by phone with May on Thursday and Friday also said countries should \"prepare for the worst\" in the form of Britain crashing out with no deal. \"I said to her I really don\\'t see how you can make further tweaks\" Rutte told his weekly post-cabinet meeting press conference. \"There is nothing unreasonable in it (the deal). Not on the British side and not on the European side. That package is what it is I\\'m afraid\" Rutte said. The plain-speaking Dutch premier was particularly firm on the so-called Irish backstop a legal guarantee to keep the Irish border open whatever the outcome of negotiations on post-Brexit ties. \"Further tweaks on the backstop - like making it temporary or giving the British a one-side competency to halt the backstop... that\\'s not going to fly\" said Rutte. Rutte said talk of Britain abandoning the result of the June 2016 Brexit referendum and staying in the European Union was \"fantasyland\". \"I am against Brexit so of course I\\'m hoping for that. But it\\'s not realistic and I\\'m not living in a fantasyland.\" \"There is nothing I can do that will prevent Brexit from taking place. The maximum influence I have... is to promote an orderly as possible Brexit.\" Rutte advised Dutch companies to increase preparedness for a \"really unwanted \\'no deal\\' scenario.\" \"I’m advising companies to keep in mind all scenarios – to hope for the best and prepare for the worst\" said Rutte whose government will launch a major Brexit information campaign at the end of January. May spoke to Rutte and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday night and to EU leaders Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk by telephone Friday to discuss where to go next on Brexit. She is expected to speak to more leaders over the weekend before laying a parliamentary motion for a new plan on Monday her office said. EU leaders have so far ruled out renegotiating the agreement but have signalled they could postpone the withdrawal if May changes her \"red lines\" on leaving the EU\\'s customs union and blocking free movement of citizens. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The move came after Smith who had challenged Corbyn for the party\\'s leadership in 2016 wrote an article in The Guardian urging his party \"to ask that the country has a vote on whether to accept the terms\" of a final deal to leave the European Union. The piece highlighted the divisions within the Labour Party over Brexit which most of its MPs oppose but which many supporters in its working-class heartlands voted for. The party has said it is committed to delivering Brexit but Corbyn recently called for Britain to stay in \"a customs union\" after it leaves the EU in March next year contrary to the negotiating position set out by Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Monday asked his ministers to prepare contingency measures in case of a no-deal Brexit. France hopes Britain will reach a deal with its European Union partners on its exit from the bloc but needs to be ready if not Philippe\\'s office said in a statement. In a government meeting convened to discuss this Philippe \"tasked ministers to prepare contingency measures that would be necessary ... to mitigate the difficulties linked with this unprecedented challenge\" it said. Measures would include facilitating the stay of British citizens currently living in France and ensuring smooth border controls the statement said. The government will ask parliament in the coming weeks to allow it to adopt them by decree. France will also need to take measures to take stock of Brexit even if there is a deal the statement said without giving details. President Emmanuel Macron said earlier on Monday that preserving EU unity was more important than forging a close relationship with post-Brexit Britain.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May should not expect a better Brexit deal than that already negotiated with the European Union Prime Minister Joseph Muscat intimated on Tuesday. Speaking during a cabinet meeting open to the press Dr Muscat said that Malta’s message to Britain was unequivocal. “The deal negotiated on Brexit is the best possible agreement for the UK to leave the EU” Dr Muscat said. “There is no room for further negotiation though perhaps there may be space to clarify certain points”. Theresa May plunged the UK’s parliament into confusion on Monday when she announced that a parliamentary vote on the Brexit deal scheduled for Tuesday would not be held as she wanted to go back to European leaders\\xa0and seek reassurances over the so-called Irish \"backstop\". Dr Muscat said Malta like other member states watched Monday’s events with interest and would continue to keep close tabs on how events unfolded. “Meanwhile this cabinet will discuss how to strengthen our preparations for whether the deal is accepted or not. We want to be prepared for all scenarios including a Brexit without a departure” he said. Ms May is on Tuesday due to meet EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker\\xa0and German chancellor Angela Merkel having already met Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

David Cameron warned that Europe\\'s peace could be jeopardised if Britain votes to leave the EU as he suggests the referendum contest will form a pivotal moment in the continent\\'s history. The Prime Minister issued the rallying cry as the EU contest enters a new phase with both sides stepping up their activities in the run-up to the June 23 vote. Mr Cameron stressed the long historic links with continental Europe - and highlight the sacrifice of British military personnel to ensure the peace of the continent as he makes a \"patriotic case\" for a Remain vote. But he also warned that the peace which Europe has enjoyed in recent years cannot be guaranteed \"beyond any shadow of doubt\" and ask \"is that a risk worth taking\". He ranked 2016 alongside other turning points in European history including the year of the Spanish Armada in 1588 Blenheim in 1704 Waterloo in 1815 the First World War in 1914 the Battle of Britain in 1940 and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Whenever we turn our back on Europe sooner or later we come to regret it \"The European Union has helped reconcile countries which were at each others\\' throats for decades\" he will say. \"Britain has a fundamental national interest in maintaining common purpose in Europe to avoid future conflict between European countries. \"And that requires British leadership and for Britain to remain a member. The truth is this: what happens in our neighbourhood matters to Britain. That was true in 1914 in 1940 and in 1989. Or you could add 1588 1704 and 1815. It is just as true in 2016. Either we influence Europe or it influences us. And if things go wrong in Europe let\\'s not pretend we can be immune from the consequences.\" Within hours of Mr Cameron\\'s address Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson - now free from the constraints of office in London - will deliver his own speech before heading out on a campaign battle bus tour across the country later this week. Setting out the long ties binding the UK to its neighbours Mr Cameron will say: \"For good or ill we have written Europe\\'s history just as Europe has helped to write ours.\" Mr Cameron said: \"Whenever we turn our back on Europe sooner or later we come to regret it. \"We have always had to go back in and always at much higher cost. \"The serried rows of white headstones in lovingly-tended Commonwealth war cemeteries stand as silent testament to the price this country has paid to help restore peace and order in Europe.\" Highlighting the bloodshed in the Balkans and Russian aggression in Georgia and Ukraine he will say: \"Can we be so sure that peace and stability on our continent are assured beyond any shadow of doubt? \"Is that a risk worth taking?\" \"I would never be so rash as to make that assumption.\" A Vote Leave spokesman said: \" Claims that leaving the EU and taking back control would somehow lead to war smack of desperation from a campaign failing to make the case for the EU and our continued payment of £350 million to Brussels every week. \"The PM\\'s words are deeply ironic given the EU\\'s own border agency says the EU\\'s borderless policy is making the whole of Europe less safe.

Photo:\\u2008DOI  The government and the Opposition yesterday shared the view that the United Kingdom’s continued membership of the European Union would be in the best interests of the EU and Malta and that the deal reached last week was a fair one. In a ministerial statement in Parliament on the recent European Council Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said all member states could benefit from the special concessions agreed upon a point that Malta had stressed from the outset. Ensuring a level playing field in the economic and financial sectors was another principle guiding the Maltese government’s approach. In fact the application of a single rule book had been included in the council’s minutes he said. Dr Muscat emphasised that the agreed deal made it clear that there was no plan B for the UK if voters rejected EU membership in June’s referendum. “An unusual clause states that should British voters opt out of the EU there will be no negotiations for a different deal and the mechanism for the UK’s exit would automatically kick in.” The consensus reached includes a proposed ‘emergency brake’ on EU migrants claiming in-work benefits. It will cover individuals for no more than four years but the UK will be allowed to apply the overall restrictions for seven. Restrictions on child benefits for EU migrants will be triggered with immediate effect for new migrants at a rate indexed to the rate of a migrant’s home country. Existing EU migrants will be paid at a lower rate from 2020. An unusual clause states that should British voters opt out there will be no negotiations for a different deal Any country will have the right to refer contentious financial regulation to a meeting of EU leaders in the European Council. Britain has a specific opt-out from the EU’s historic commitment to forge an “ever closer union among the peoples of Europe”. Opposition leader Simon Busuttil asked whether government was carrying out an impact assessment on the possible referendum outcomes and about reciprocity considerations in view of benefits enjoyed by Maltese citizens in the UK and British residents in Malta. Dr Muscat said the government was carrying out various assessments about the possible impact of a Brexit. Financial services seemed to be the most impacted and there were positive and negative impacts in both scenarios he said. On balance it appeared that the UK’s EU membership was more beneficial to Malta. Politically the UK was a counterbalance for the thrust towards greater federalism in the EU in areas such as tax harmonisation while pushing for the further dismantling of trade barriers. As for Maltese living in the UK Dr Muscat said the government was advised that if the UK left the EU the 1956 bilateral social security and health agreements would still apply to Maltese citizens. Migration now a standing item on the agenda was discussed at the council meeting. The four goals of the Union were a reduction in the number of arrivals the protection of external borders the combat against illegal immigration and the integrity of Schengen. Once the security screening was concluded Malta would host the first 21 migrants under the relocation and readmission agreements Dr Muscat said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Raab said May\\'s plan threatened the integrity of the United Kingdom and he could not support an indefinite backstop arrangement where the EU held a veto over Britain\\'s ability to exit the bloc. His resignation fuelled a selloff in the British currency which was already struggling to gain traction after May said on Wednesday she had won over her divided cabinet following a five-hour meeting. In volatile trading the British currency plunged one percent against the dollar to $1.2839 and 1.3 percent against the euro to 88.23 pence. \"Raab resigning just now changes the ballgame. Hard to be optimistic on GBP in the short term. \" Nomura analyst Jordan Rochester said. \"But equally Theresa May has survived much worse. It’s whether we get a flood of (ministerial) resignations to follow.\" Those concerns were reflected in the foreign exchange derivatives markets where three and six-month gauges of expected volatility in the British currency remained firm while extreme short-dated volatility indicators edged lower. That uncertainty was also reflected in the money markets where investors have all but priced out a rate hike by the Bank of England next year. Bond yields fell across the board with those on benchmark two-year British government debt falling 9 basis points to 0.7 percent. Big moves this week have boosted volatility in the British currency with realised price swings this week alone averaging about 12 percent annualised on a daily basis twice that of end-October. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Shutterstock  The officially designated Brexit campaign \"cheated\" during the European Union referendum a whistleblower has claimed. The claims centre around Vote Leave\\'s links to another campaign - BeLeave - which it helped fund. Shahmir Sanni who worked on the campaign claimed Vote Leave used it to get around strict spending limits set by the Electoral Commission. Vote Leave has strongly denied wrongdoing and said the £625000 donated to BeLeave was within the rules. But Mr Sanni told Channel 4 News: \"I know that Vote Leave cheated ... I know that people have been lied to and that the referendum wasn\\'t legitimate.\" Mr Sanni was in a relationship with senior Vote Leave figure Stephen Parkinson - now Theresa May\\'s political secretary - at the time of the referendum and claimed through his lawyers he was \"outed\" by the Number 10 aide in the run-up to the Channel 4 disclosure. Mr Sanni went to the Electoral Commission with two other pro-Brexit friends on Thursday who say they helped the Vote Leave campaign two years ago Channel 4 reported. Their lawyers have given the election watchdog signed statements. Mr Sanni told the broadcaster he was initially a Vote Leave outreach volunteer but he was then assigned to BeLeave. Vote Leave said it did not recall Mr Sanni working as a volunteer but he was \"like hundreds of others who occasionally visited the offices\". Mr Sanni said that he and BeLeave\\'s co-founder Darren Grimes always reported to Mr Parkinson. \"There was no time where anything BeLeave did didn\\'t go through Stephen\" he said. In the final 10 days of the 2016 referendum campaign Vote Leave donated £625000 to Mr Grimes who was registered as a permitted participant with the money used to pay Canadian data firm Aggregate IQ (AIQ) the programme said. Asked whether they could have refused to spend the money on AIQ Mr Sanni said: \"We didn\\'t ever feel like we had that level of control. \"That\\'s what I mean we never felt like we had control over the organisation itself.\" He claimed: \"In effect they used BeLeave to over-spend and not just by a small amount ... Almost two-thirds of a million pounds makes all the difference and it wasn\\'t legal.\" Mr Parkinson said he was \"saddened\" by the \"factually incorrect and misleading\" statements by Mr Sanni and his lawyers. He added: \"At the relevant time during the referendum period the commission advised Vote Leave that it was permissible to make a donation in the way it proposed to do to BeLeave. \"Twice since the referendum the commission has investigated this matter and twice it has found no evidence of wrongdoing. A third investigation into the same issue is currently taking place. \"The Electoral Commission has not contacted me in relation to any of these inquiries but I will of course be happy to assist in them if they wish me to do so. \"I firmly deny the allegations in the programme. \"I had no responsibility for digital campaigning or donations on the Vote Leave campaign and am confident that I stayed within the law and strict spending rules at all times.\" Mr Grimes also denies all the allegations Channel 4 said. A Vote Leave spokesman said it had \"twice been cleared on this matter by the Electoral Commission\" adding: \"There are now a number of new accusations and allegations. \"While many of them seem irrelevant or trivial some are serious and potentially damaging to the reputations of those caught up in those allegations. \"As has been the case throughout Vote Leave is obligated to review - to the extent it can after this long elapsed period since the referendum - all such allegations and is doing so. \"We will as appropriate share any relevant findings with the Electoral Commission again as we have always done.\" An Electoral Commission spokeswoman said: \"The commission has a number of investigations open in relation to campaigners at the EU Referendum; it does not comment on live investigations. \" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The award of the George Cross in 1942 by King George VI to bear witness to the nation’s “heroism and devotion” following the second siege of Malta is only the best-known episode in a story that spans the centuries: the joint enterprise of ridding Malta of the French garrison in 1800 the islands’ part in the British Empire their crucial role as a supply station in the World War I their valiant endurance against the Axis powers in World War II their long service as the home of the British Mediterranean Fleet and accession to the Commonwealth on gaining independence in 1964 are testament to a true partnership. These bonds of history and affection are not confined to the past. In a survey I conducted before the EU referendum I was pleased to see that fondness for Britain among Maltese people lives on. Asked to rate how favourable they felt towards each EU member respondents in Malta gave a higher score to the UK than to any other country – a higher score indeed than we received from anywhere else. While people in Britain are happy to trade and work with other countries on common problems we never had much of an emotional connection to the EU itself Offered a range of positive and negative words and phrases to describe the British Maltese participants most often chose “cosmopolitan” “polite” “open-minded” and “respectful” (a much more flattering selection than that made by some of our other European partners). More than three quarters said they would like the UK to remain in the EU – well above the average of other member countries – and the Maltese were the most likely of all to say they were willing to see changes in the terms of the UK’s membership if that would keep us in the club. It is not surprising then that some in Malta were shocked and disappointed even hurt by British voters’ decision to leave the European Union. Was the UK with its maritime heritage and long history of engaging with the world turning in on itself and away from its old friends? I don’t think this is the case at all. To understand why we need to look at the reasons behind the result. My research at the time found the three most common motivations for leave voters were the principle that decisions about the UK should be taken in the UK; that leaving offered the best chance for the country to regain control over its borders which many felt had been lost under free movement; and that remaining would leave the UK with little say over how the EU expanded its membership or powers. This third point is one on which British voters differ from many of their continental counterparts. In the Europe-wide survey I mentioned above I found Maltese people to be happier with their EU membership than those of any other member state – and the very best of luck to them. But British voters have always had a rather different view of the EU than many others in Europe. They never liked the idea of “ever closer union” that remains the ambition of its leaders. While people in Britain are happy to trade and work with other countries on common problems we never had much of an emotional connection to the EU itself. While some Europeans see the EU institutions as profound symbols of unity and progress for Brits the relationship was more transactional. In the end British voters decided the costs of membership outweighed the benefits – not that they wanted nothing more to do with their friends and allies. It became almost a cliché during the campaign to say that leaving the EU doesn’t mean leaving Europe but that doesn’t make it any the less true. I advocated Brexit warning of the EU’s ambitions for further integration in crucial areas like tax spending foreign policy and defence. But as someone who invests and does business around the world not even my critics would accuse me of being a Little Englander. Britain has never been an inward-looking country and has not suddenly become one. The government will be looking to conclude new trade deals around the world as swiftly as possible once Brexit is complete. Our ties go well beyond Europe and our post-EU days are likely to see renewed interest in partnerships like the Commonwealth in which Malta has recently had a prominent role and whose heads of government meeting takes place in London shortly. I am confident then that in its new era Britain will value old friends as it forges new alliances. As far as I’m concerned Malta falls into both categories. I have started spending a good deal of time here in recent years (and my plane even more so having been involved in a small mishap at the airport just after Christmas). But I first set foot in Malta in 1953 travelling with my parents on a passenger ship from Mozambique to London my father having completed his first stint as a colonial officer in Nyasaland now Malawi. On each visit I make new friends always finding people to be warm and welcoming and enjoying a certain comforting familiarity about the place that anyone coming from Britain would recognise. The ingredients of this familiarity – driving on the left beer served in pints English as an official language to name just a few – are not down to our fellow membership of the EU which represents just 15 years out of an alliance lasting more than 200. The half a million British people who visit Malta every year are not about to stay at home in their soggy deckchairs. Affiliation to a Brussels-based political organisation has not defined our shared history; neither will it determine our future.

UK companies rushed to hedge their currency exposure today pushing up the cost of protection against sharp price swings to its highest in over four years as concern grew that Britain will vote to leave the European Union. Those campaigning to leave the EU got some help yesterday when London Mayor Boris Johnson announced he would back them. Bookmakers are now giving better odds that Britain will leave and Citi a leading foreign exchange player has upped the risk of \"Brexit\" to 30 to 40 percent from 20 to 30 percent. \"There was a strong reaction from UK corporate treasurers this morning as they come to terms with the possibility of sterling losses in the coming months\" said Richard de Meo a director at Foenix Partners a firm that offers hedging to mid-and small-size UK companies. \"Those who can wait believe in a rebound post-referendum on the assumption that Britain will remain in the EU but short- term needs are being hedged at current levels.\" The six-month implied volatility in sterling/dollar - used by investors and many companies to hedge currency exposure and a gauge of how sharply the currency is expected to move - rose to 12.2 percent its highest since late 2011 according to Reuters charts. The contract captures the date of the referendum scheduled for June 23. The six-month sterling/dollar risk reversals - a gauge of demand for options on a currency rising or falling - indicate the bias towards sterling weakness is at its highest since late 2011 according to Reuters data. In the spot market sterling fell to a seven-year low of $1.4057 down 2.3 percent and on track for its biggest daily loss in nearly six years [GBP/]. \"Our corporate desk is seeing more hedging being put on by corporates who have sterling exposure\" said Jacob Nell UK economist at Morgan Stanley. The euro was up 1.2 percent at 78.30 pence with some now expecting the single currency to gain in coming months to 80 pence. \"In our view euro zone-based clients should maintain a high short-term FX hedge ratio on sterling risks\" Dankse Bank a large Nordic Bank said in a note. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Wall Street stock prices rose yesterday as investors hoped US-China trade tensions could ease while the pound soared on rising prospects for a finalized agreement on the UK’s exit from the EU. Oil prices fell more than three per cent but US natural gas futures soared to their highest since November 2014 on forecasts for colder weather. The US benchmark S&P 500 stock index rose on reports that US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had resumed discussions with China Vice Premier Liu He. Technology stocks bounced back a day after a rout that led the S&P 500's nearly two per cent decline. US equities rose further after White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow said Washington had resumed trade talks with China and characterised the development as “very positive.” “It’s potentially good news on the trade war front” said Edmund Tran equity strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management in New York. The US dollar index which has steadily climbed as the US-China trade dispute has escalated dipped 0.4 per cent. Conversely the pound rose 1.4 per cent to $1.3033 after reports that the UK and the EU had agreed upon the text of a Brexit agreement and that British Prime Minister Theresa May would hold a Cabinet meeting today. The euro also rose from a 16-month low last up 0.6 to $1.1282 though its gains were capped by concerns over Italy's budget. The Italian government faces a Tuesday deadline to submit a revised budget to the EU. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 32.82 points or 0.13 per cent to 25420 the S&P 500 gained 14.02 points or 0.51 per cent to 2740.24 and the Nasdaq Composite added 62.16 points or 0.86 per cent to 7263.03. The pan-European STOXX 600 added 0.67 per cent to 364.44. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.36 per cent. Benchmark 10-year US Treasury notes last rose 8/32 in price to yield 3.1599 percent from 3.189 percent late on Friday. The Treasury market was closed on Monday for the Veterans Day holiday. Oil prices extended their fall from Monday after US President Donald Trump put pressure on Opec not to cut supply to prop up prices. US crude fell 4.27 per cent to $57.37 per barrel and Global benchmark Brent crude was down $2.70 a barrel at $67.42. Both crude benchmarks have fallen more than 20 per cent since peaking at four-year highs in early October. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  * British economy \"as strong as it could be\" - Osborne * China pleads for stability after Brexit shock * British ruling party and opposition both in crisis * Police investigate anti-Polish hate crime * Sterling and shares fall U.S. urges calm Britain\\'s decision to leave the European Union sent new shockwaves through financial markets today with the pound falling despite the country\\'s leaders\\' attempts to ease political and economic turmoil unleashed by the move. Finance minister George Osborne said the British economy was strong enough to cope with the volatility caused by Thursday\\'s referendum the biggest blow since World War Two to the European goal of forging greater unity. But his words failed to halt the fall of sterling which later sank to its lowest level against the U.S. currency for 31 years continuing the slide that began last week when Britons confounded investors\\' expectations by voting to end 43 years of EU membership. European bank shares had their worst two-day fall on record and world stocks as measured by MSCI were on track for worst two-day fall since the aftermath of the Lehman Bros collapse in late 2008. With the ruling Conservatives looking for a new leader after Prime Minister David Cameron\\'s resignation on Friday and lawmakers from the opposition Labour party stepping up a rebellion against their leader Britain sank deeper into political and economic chaos. \"There\\'s no political leadership in the UK right when markets need the reassurance of direction\" said Luke Hickmore of Aberdeen Asset Management expressing the view of many in the City of London financial centre. Cameron has promised to stay on until October as a caretaker. A committee responsible for running the process of selecting a new leader for his Conservative Party recommended a faster process that should be completed by early September. The prime minister sought to calm fears over the fallout of the referendum and said there should be no attempt in parliament where a majority of members like him argued that Britain should stay in the EU to block Britain\\'s departure. \"I am clear and the cabinet agreed this morning that the decision must be accepted\" Cameron told parliament which faces a public petition for a new referendum. But his refusal to start formal moves immediately to pull the country out of the EU has prompted many European leaders to demand quicker action by Britain the EU\\'s second largest economy after Germany to leave the 28-country bloc. \"It should be implemented quickly. We cannot remain in an uncertain and indefinite situation\" French finance minister Michel Sapin said on France 2 television. Guenther Oettinger a German member of the EU\\'s executive European Commission said Cameron and his party should not risk causing damage at home and abroad by waiting until October. \"Every day of uncertainty prevents investors from putting their funds into Britain and also other European markets\" he told Deutschlandfunk radio. MERKEL HAS NO BRAKE NO ACCELERATOR While European countries would like to end the uncertainty with swift negotiations they cannot begin until Britain formally notifies the EU it is planning to exit. Since Cameron decided to leave that task to his successor escalating turmoil in both major political parties has created even more uncertainty over Britain\\'s plans for the future and the transition to a new leader. German Chancellor Angela Merkel she had \"neither a brake nor an accelerator\" to control events. She has appeared to take a softer line than some European leaders. But she ruled out informal talks before London notifies the EU of its intention to leave under the EU\\'s Lisbon Treaty which provides its constitutional basis. Making clear the exit negotiations would not be easy Volker Kauder who leads Merkel\\'s conservatives in parliament told ARD television: \"There will be no special treatment there will be no gifts.\" The shock waves are being felt across the globe at a time when economies are still fragile from the 2008 economic crisis interest rates are close to zero and central banks have fewer tools than normal to revive demand if countries enter recession. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said uncertainties over the global economy had heightened and called for a \"united stable EU and a stable prosperous Britain\". Financial markets misjudged the referendum betting on the status quo despite abundant signs that the vote would be close. When reality dawned the reaction was brutal. Sterling fell as much as 11 percent against the dollar on Friday for its worst day in modern history while $2.8 trillion was wiped off the value of world stocks -- the biggest daily loss ever. That trumped even the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy during the 2008 financial crisis and the Black Monday stock market crash of 1987 according to Standard & Poor\\'s Dow Jones Indices. By Monday afternoon sterling had shed around 3.6 percent against the dollar to $1.3209 despite an attempt by Osborne to ease concerns by saying he was working closely with the Bank of England and officials in other leading economies. \"Our economy is about as strong as it could be to confront the challenge our country now faces\" he told reporters. \"It is inevitable after Thursday\\'s vote that Britain\\'s economy is going to have to adjust to the new situation we find ourselves in.\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew also tried to restore calm telling CNBC television it had been \"an orderly impact so far\" though he later added: \"We have resilience built into our economy but we\\'re not cut off from the world.\" Visiting Brussels U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said it was important that \"nobody loses their head\" as the EU and Britain deal with the fallout from the referendum. \"PENSIONS ARE SAFE\" The vote to leave the EU has increased the likelihood of Scotland holding a second referendum on independence after voters there strongly backed remaining in the EU. Boris Johnson a leading proponent of a Brexit and likely contender to replace Cameron praised Osborne for saying \"some reassuring things to the markets\". The former London mayor said it was now clear \"people\\'s pensions are safe the pound is stable markets are stable. I think that is all very good news.\" But financial markets took a different view. The yield on British 10-year government bonds fell below 1 percent for the first time as investors bet the Brexit vote would trigger a Bank of England interest rate cut aimed at steadying the economy. Many economists have cut economic growth forecasts for Britain with Goldman Sachs expecting a mild recession within a year. The risks affect economies far beyond Britain. \"Against the backdrop of globalisation it\\'s impossible for each country to talk about its own development discarding the world economic environment\" China\\'s Li told the World Economic Forum in the city of Tianjin. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe instructed his finance minister to watch currency markets \"ever more closely\" and take steps if necessary. DIVIDED PARTIES The referendum revealed social as well as economic stresses in divided Britain. Immigration was one of the main themes of the campaign alongside discontent with the political establishment in general and the Conservatives in particular. Many Brexit backers complained the EU had allowed uncontrolled numbers of migrants to arrive from eastern Europe. Police said offensive leaflets targeting Poles had been distributed in Huntingdon central England and graffiti had been daubed on a Polish cultural centre in central London on Sunday three days after the vote. According to a local newspaper the Cambridge News the leaflets said \"Leave the EU/No more Polish vermin\" in English and Polish. The Polish embassy in London said it was shocked by the \"xenophobic abuse\" aimed at the Polish community and others. With Britain now facing uncertainty over how its trade relationship with the EU will unfold Johnson tried to calm fears by writing in the Daily Telegraph newspaper that there would be continued free trade and access to the single market. He suggested Britain would not have to accept free movement of workers saying it could implement an immigration policy which suited business and industry. However single market rules stipulate that countries must accept the free movement of people as well as goods. Yielding on immigration would anger many Britons who voted to leave. Johnson is expected to declare soon that he is running to lead the Conservatives who have been divided for decades between pro- and anti-EU factions. Divisions within the opposition are also deep. A wave of Labour lawmakers resigned from leader Jeremy Corbyn\\'s team on Monday adding to the 11 senior figures who quit on Sunday saying his campaign to keep Britain in the EU was half-hearted. Corbyn a left-winger who has strong support among ordinary party members has said he is going nowhere. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06   \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

At the same time it continues supporting administrations in their own preparations and urges all EU citizens and businesses to continue informing themselves about the consequences of a possible “no-deal” scenario and to complete their no-deal preparedness. This follows the European Council (Article 50) conclusions last week calling for work to be continued on preparedness and contingency. \"While a “no-deal” scenario is not desirable the EU is prepared for it\" the Commission said. Following a request by Prime Minister Theresa May the European Council (Article 50) agreed on Thursday to extend the UK\\'s departure date to May 22 2019 provided the Withdrawal Agreement is approved by the House of Commons by March 29 2019 at the latest. If the Withdrawal Agreement is not approved by the House of Commons by then the European Council has agreed to an extension until April 12 2019. In that scenario the United Kingdom would be expected to indicate a way forward before this date. \"While the European Union continues to hope that it will not be the case this means that if the Withdrawal Agreement is not ratified by Friday March 29 a “no-deal” scenario may occur on April 12. The EU has prepared for this scenario and has remained united throughout its preparations. It is now important that everyone is ready for and aware of the practical consequences a “no-deal” scenario brings\" the Commission said. A “no-deal” scenario In a “no-deal” scenario the UK will become a third country without any transitionary arrangements. All EU primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the UK from that moment onwards. There will be no transition period as provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement. This will obviously cause significant disruption for citizens and businesses. In such a scenario the UK\\'s relations with the EU would be governed by general international public law including rules of the World Trade Organisation. The EU will be required to immediately apply its rules and tariffs at its borders with the UK. This includes checks and controls for customs sanitary and phytosanitary standards and verification of compliance with EU norms. Despite the considerable preparations of the Member States\\' customs authorities these controls could cause significant delays at the border. UK entities would also cease to be eligible to receive EU grants and to participate in EU procurement procedures under current terms. Similarly UK citizens will no longer be citizens of the European Union. They will be subject to additional checks when crossing borders into the European Union. Again Member States have made considerable preparations at ports and airports to ensure that these checks are done as efficiently as possible but they may nevertheless cause delays. The EU\\'s “no-deal” preparedness and contingency work Since December 2017 the European Commission has been preparing for a “no-deal” scenario. It has published 90 preparedness notices 3 Commission Communications and has made 19 legislative proposals. The Commission has held extensive technical discussions with the EU27 member states both on general issues of preparedness and contingency work and on specific sectorial legal and administrative preparedness issues. The Commission has now also completed its tour of the capitals of the 27 EU member states. The aim of these visits was to provide any necessary clarifications on the Commission\\'s preparedness and contingency action and to discuss national preparations and contingency plans. The visits showed a high degree of preparation by Member States for all scenarios. Member states have also been engaged in intensive national preparations. An overview of residency rights in the EU27 member states is available here as well as direct links to national preparedness websites. Contingency and preparedness legislative measures To date the Commission has tabled 19 legislative proposals; 17 proposals have been adopted or agreed by the European Parliament and the Council. Formal adoption of all those files by the European Parliament and Council is currently taking place. Two proposals are to be finalised by the two co-legislators in due course. As outlined in the Commission\\'s Brexit Preparedness Communications it warned that the EU\\'s contingency measures will not – and cannot – mitigate the overall impact of a \"no-deal\" scenario nor do they in any way compensate for the lack of preparedness or replicate the full benefits of EU membership or the favourable terms of any transition period as provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement. \"These proposals are temporary in nature limited in scope and will be adopted unilaterally by the EU. They are not “mini-deals” and have not been negotiated with the UK\" it explained. The EU has maintained - and will continue to maintain - a fully united position throughout its preparations and during any possible “no-deal” period. The “no-deal” contingency measures include: - PEACE programme: the continuation of the PEACE programme on the island of Ireland until the end of 2020. As for the period after 2020 the Commission has already proposed as part of its proposals for the next Multi-annual Financial Framework to continue and strengthen cross-border support for peace and reconciliation in the border counties of Ireland and Northern Ireland. - The EU Budget (in the process of final adoption): in a “no-deal” scenario the EU will be in a position to honour its commitments and to continue making payments in 2019 to UK beneficiaries for contracts signed and decisions made before 30 March 2019 on condition that the UK honours its obligations under the 2019 budget and that it accepts the necessary audit checks and controls. - Fishing rights and compensation: these measures provide for compensation for fishermen and operators from EU Members States under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund for the temporary cessation of fishing activities. It also ensures that the EU is in a position to grant UK vessels access to EU waters until the end of 2019 on the condition that EU vessels are also granted reciprocal access to UK waters - Financial services: temporary limited measures to ensure that there is no immediate disruption in the central clearing of derivatives central depositaries services for EU operators currently using UK operators and for facilitating novation for a fixed period of 12 months of certain over-the-counter derivatives contracts where a contract is transferred from a UK to an EU27 counterparty. - Air connectivity and safety: these two measures will ensure basic air connectivity in order to avoid full interruption of air traffic between the EU and the UK in the event of a “no-deal” scenario. - Road connectivity: allows for the continuation of safe basic road connectivity between the EU and the UK for a limited period of time provided that the UK gives reciprocal treatment to EU companies and operators. - Rail connectivity: ensures the validity of safety authorisations for certain parts of rail infrastructure for a strictly limited period of three months to allow long-term solutions in line with EU law to be put in place. This is in particular related to the Channel Tunnel and will be conditional on the United Kingdom maintaining safety standards identical to EU requirements. - Ship inspections: this aims to ensure legal certainty and secure business continuity in shipping. - Re-alignment of the North Sea – Mediterranean Core Network Corridor: This adds new maritime links between Ireland France Belgium and the Netherlands to the core network and introduces a new funding priority to the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF): adapting transport infrastructure for security and external border check purposes. - Climate policy: this measure ensures that a \"no-deal\" scenario does not affect the smooth functioning and the environmental integrity of the Emissions Trading System. - Erasmus + programme: students and trainees abroad participating in Erasmus+ at the time of the UK\\'s withdrawal can complete their studies and continue to receive the relevant funding or grants. - Social security entitlements: the entitlements (such as periods of insurance (self) employment or residence in the United Kingdom before withdrawal) of those people who exercised their right to free movement before the UK\\'s withdrawal are safeguarded. - Visa reciprocity (in the process of final adoption): visa-free travel to the EU for UK nationals if the UK also grants reciprocal and non-discriminatory visa-free travel to all EU citizens. State aid As regards the need for financial resources and/or technical assistance the EU\\'s existing State aid rules make it possible to address problems encountered by businesses in the case of a \"no-deal\" Brexit. By way of example State aid rules permit consultancy aid for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or training aid which could be used to assist with SMEs preparedness (including possible future custom formalities). The Rescue and Restructuring Guidelines contain provisions on temporary restructuring support schemes for SMEs which could be useful to address their liquidity problems caused by Brexit. Access to finance is possible in various formats e.g. through State-financed lending schemes respecting the reference rate or State guarantees under the guarantee notice. Funding and support under the EU budget Technical and financial assistance from the European Union can also be made available in certain areas such as the training of customs officials under the Customs 2020 programme. Other programmes can help similar training projects in the area of sanitary and phytosanitary controls. For agriculture EU law provides a variety of instruments to cope with the most immediate effects of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom in particular in a no-deal scenario. Preparedness notices The European Commission has published 90 sector-specific preparedness notices. They provide detailed guidance to the different sectors affected by Brexit.\\xa0 Nigeria\\'s ex-spy chief sought over $43 million cash haul Britain\\'s May lays out Brexit survival plans \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Brexit campaigners sent a flotilla of fishing boats up the River Thames decked in colorful flags and anti-EU banners in an eye-catching effort to galvanise support a week before Britons vote in a referendum on EU membership. The leader of the anti-EU UKIP party Nigel Farage joined one boat highlighting what the Brexit campaign argue is the damage being done to Britain\\'s fishing industry by European Union quotas. Other boats in the flotilla flew the British and English flags with signs bearing messages such as \"Save Our Country\" as polls show growing support for the campaign to quit the EU ahead of the June 23 vote. But in a sign of the passions surrounding the impending vote musician Bob Geldof joined a rival boat of \"Remain\" supporters who held up pro-EU banners in protest at the flotilla while others draped \"In\" banners from Tower Bridge and the riverbank. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The earlier we can give business that reassurance the more quickly we will get businesses investing again” he said. Hammond said the British people wanted a Brexit that protected their jobs and their standard of living. Hammond said he was not at odds with other ministers in government over his approach. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  HSBC sees the chances of a hard Brexit receding after Britain’s shock election result which could result in fewer jobs moving out of London its investment bank chief said. HSBC Europe’s biggest bank has said it could move up to 1000 investment bankers to Paris where the bank has a licence and significant operations in the event of a hard Brexit that would mean losing access to the single market. But the ruling Conservative party’s setback in an election last week has deepened uncertainty over Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plans that included quitting the European customs union and single market and a focus on controlling immigration. “I don’t think that we’ll go for hard Brexit anymore from all that we hear” Samir Assaf HSBC’s investment bank chief said at an investor presentation on Thursday. “If the hard Brexit transformed into a soft Brexit that’s as well very good news for us because it will be less hassle and we will be able to do much more things from London. We would be very happy to remain in London business as usual” he said. Could move up to 1000 investment bankers to Paris Finance minister Philip Hammond said yesterday that Britain should prioritise jobs and prosperity in talks on leaving the European Union adding London would take a “pragmatic approach” to finding a deal that worked for Britain and the EU. Assaf said the one-off cost from reorganising operations once Britain leaves the EU would be limited for HSBC and should also provide an opportunity for the bank. “We have our base in France we have our building in France we have our systems in France we have our licences in France and the addition that we have to do for Brexit effort is marginal but Brexit is as well for us is an opportunity because ...a lot of clients will come to us” said Assaf. Large global banks in London plan to move about 9000 jobs in the next two years to financial centres that will stay in the EU including Frankfurt Paris and Dublin according to a Reuters’ tally of job warnings. Many international banks have used London as a hub to conduct activities across the EU and are now having to reorganise operations to varying degrees to ensure they can still service clients once Britain leaves the bloc. Investec analyst Ian Gordon said HSBC’s global banking and markets management sees the bank as a relative beneficiary of a hard Brexit as its existing licences in the EU and French operations could help it grab market share from others less well placed. “Under ‘soft’ Brexit HSBC believes that such relative advantage would be diluted. We find it somewhat ironic therefore that HSBC Group management continues to be perceived as campaigning vociferously for ‘soft’ Brexit which would seemingly be to the detriment of shareholders?” he wrote. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Judges at the European Union's highest court will hear a case on the Brexit process on November 27 reviewing whether Britain can unilaterally withdraw its decision to leave the EU the Court of Justice said in a statement on Tuesday. The case was raised to the Luxembourg justices by a Scottish court where people opposed to Brexit asked for a ruling that would clarify the interpretation of Article 50 of the EU treaty under which London gave two years notice of its departure. It is not clear when the ECJ might deliver a final ruling. British Prime Minister Theresa May insists that Britain will leave the EU in March but faces a battle in parliament in the coming weeks to approve a potential treaty intended to ease the country's departure and limit disruption from the move. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain has sidelined the minister responsible for financial services from addressing the impact on the sector of leaving the EU a shakeup that a senior bank executive called a “vote of no confidence” in the industry’s main government contact. Lucy Neville-Rolfe commercial secretary at the Treasury has had Brexit’s impact on financial services added to her official portfolio the Treasury said confirming a change that had been made without fanfare several weeks ago. The new arrangement means Simon Kirby the Treasury’s economic secretary is no longer in charge of overseeing the impact of Brexit on Britain’s large banking sector. Kirby’s post is known informally as “City minister” as the government’s liaison to the finance industry based in the City of London. “Clearly it’s a sign of a vote of no confidence in Kirby” said one senior bank executive who discussed the change in roles on condition of anonymity to avoid taking sides publicly in a political personnel matter. “Kirby is not responsible for Brexit even though it’s the biggest issue facing the City.” The Treasury said Kirby would still have the same role as his predecessors as City minister overseeing the government’s overall relationship with the financial sector. Having a second minister look at Brexit reflected “the importance we place on this area” it said in an e-mail to Reuters in response to a request for comment on the change. “Although the lack of continuity at this point in the process is alarming frankly we don’t care who it is the government chooses to oversee the process as long as they can provide some clarity to the financial services sector” the opposition Labour Party’s City spokesman Jonathan Reynolds told Reuters in an e-mailed statement. Of the seven people who have held the post of City minister since it was created in 2008 Kirby 52 is the first without either a background in financial services or a PhD in economics. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May will chair a discussion on Brexit and the economy at the first meeting of a new business council today a bid to rebuild bridges with companies concerned over Britain’s departure from the European Union. After losing the governing Conservatives’ parliamentary majority at an ill-judged election last month May has stepped up efforts to engage with business after some firms criticised her government for failing to address their worries over Brexit. Many companies have urged the government to push the European Union to agree a clear and lengthy transitional arrangement after Britain leaves the bloc in 2019 to help them make investment decisions. Steps to boost the nation’s economy The meeting marks a shift for May whose former aides had wanted to break what they felt was an overly cosy relationship between big business and government before her authority was weakened at the June election. “Theresa May will tomorrow chair the first meeting of a new business council which will provide a direct link to business on the government’s Brexit strategy as well as looking at wider issues such as the development of a modern industrial strategy and steps to boost the nation’s economy” May’s spokesman said. The council would meet on a regular basis and its cast list would change on a “rolling basis to ensure broad representation across different sectors and industries over time” the spokesman added. Alongside the new business council there will be regular meetings with Britain’s five main trade organisations chaired by Chancellor Philip Hammond business minister Greg Clark and Brexit minister David Davis to focus on Brexit. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s looming departure from the European Union has led nearly half of big companies from the rest of the bloc to cut investment in the country a poll of 800 executives released two years after the Brexit referendum found. The survey by law firm Baker & McKenzie also found that three quarters of bosses wanted Brussels to make concessions to Britain to secure a better trading relationship after it leaves the EU in early 2019. \"It\\'s very clear that especially German companies think that Brexit is bad for business\" said Anahita Thoms a trade partner at Baker & McKenzie in Duesseldorf. Germany\\'s BDI industry group warned last week that Britain is heading towards a disorderly Brexit that could have disastrous consequences. Airbus has said a withdrawal without a deal would force the aircraft maker to reconsider its long-term position and put thousands of British jobs at risk. However Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s spokeswoman said the government was confident of getting a good deal ensuring trade is as free and frictionless as possible. Asked whether punishing Britain for leaving the EU or continuing to trade on preferential terms was more important 96 per cent of respondents to the survey said trade was more important than teaching London a lesson for Brexit. There was also a majority view that business leaders had not been properly consulted or their views taken into account by the EU negotiating team as it tries to hammer out a post-Brexit trade deal. Two thirds of respondents said they wanted a free-trade deal while 45 percent were in favour of a customs union Baker & McKenzie said. The law firm surveyed executives in France Germany Sweden Ireland Spain and the Netherlands working at companies in a range of industries with annual sales of at least £250 milllion. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  British Prime Minister Theresa May said US President Donald Trump had previously advised her to sue the European Union as part of her Brexit strategy disclosing a piece of advice Trump said last week she had ignored. \"He told me I should sue the EU\" May told BBC television. \"Sue the EU. Not go into negotiations - sue them.\" May pointed out that Trump who was visiting Britain had also advised that now she was in a negotiation she should not walk away. \"I want us to be able to sit down to negotiate the best deal for Britain\" May said. Trump said in an interview published on Friday that May had not followed his advice on Brexit - one of a number of comments that were seen as a damning critique of her exit plans and added fuel to the raging debate over May\\'s plans to leave the EU.

Britons voted to leave the EU in a referendum in June 2016 and the issue has dominated the political landscape since.

Britain\\'s ramshackle exit from the European Union with two ministers quitting the government on Monday could damage economic growth in the euro zone European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny said. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit minister David Davis departed over Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s plans to leave the European Union leaving the British leader\\'s Brexit plans in ruins. Read:\\xa0Boris Johnson quits leaving May\\'s Brexit plan in tatters Read:\\xa0New Brexit secretary appointed amid mayhem The ECB Bank is following the fallout from Britain\\'s efforts to negotiate its departure Nowotny said highlighting it as one of the three main threats to economic growth in the 19 countries which use the single European currency. \"For the eurozone the Brexit constellation is something we look at\" Nowotny told an event in Zurich just before news of Johnson\\'s exit. \"It is mainly a risk for the UK but it also poses risks and uncertainties for the eurozone.\" Other potential problems included looming trade wars along with constraints on economic capacity which could lead to slower growth he said. The ECB expects euro zone economic growth of 2.1 per cent this year easing to 1.9 per cent in 2019 and a 1.7 per cent rate in 2020. \"These lower growth rates do not mean an end to the good times\" Nowotny said. \"It means we have reached a plateau and can grow with capacity growth.\" In this uncertain environment the ECB would adopt a \"wait and see\" approach to any tightening of monetary policy after it keeps negative rates on hold through the summer of 2019 he added. The ECB said last month it intended to end its €2.6 trillion bond purchase programme by the close of the year but said rates would stay unchanged at least until next summer a wording that pushed back rate hike expectations. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Brexit damage on the European Union’s automotive industry is set to be mitigated after MEPs overwhelmingly agreed to a report that will safeguard jobs in the sector and smoothen the continued trade of cars and their components between the two sides. The report titled “Regulation on complementing EU type-approval legislation concerning the UK withdrawal from the Union” was piloted by Maltese MEP Marlene Mizzi and was passed with an a massive majority winning 640 votes in favour and just 11 against. This is the first legislative Brexit-linked report that was approved by the European Parliament led and negotiated by a Maltese MEP. Its provisions create a mechanism that minimise the impact that the UK withdrawal from the Union might have on the automotive industry and gives an element of continuance in the trade of cars their components and vehicles in general. This also means that jobs in such an important industry have been safeguarded consumers have been protected and road safety and market surveillance have been addressed in a legal framework. “I am proud to have led the negotiations on behalf of Parliament and to have been able to finalise the first Brexit-related report” Ms Mizzi said. “Even though Brexit still harbours uncertainty and raises questions to which all citizens want an answer we as a Union must be prepared for any eventuality to ensure the least disruption of our industries reduce the risk of job losses and ensure that consumers are protected in what concerns a very important product - cars and components “ she added.The Mizzi report managed to get the approval of all the political groups from all the member states rendering it one of the strongest supported legislative reports that have been voted upon. The report will now be incorporated in the Brexit legislation being agreed upon between the UK and the EU. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The airline which also reported flying nearly 140 million passengers last year said the permit means it can \"operate UK domestic and UK to non-EU routes in a post-Brexit environment if necessary\". British Prime Minister Theresa May and the 27 EU leaders reached a draft withdrawal agreement in November that is meant to pave the way for Britain\\'s smooth exit from the bloc on March 29. But the deal faces strong resistance in the British parliament which is set to vote on it later this month. Its rejection raises the prospects of Britain leaving the bloc without an agreement creating disruptions that threaten to hit the aviation industry hard. London and Brussels are making contingency plans that will allow UK carriers to continue flying to EU countries even if there is no agreement on future trade and other rules. But it would only be a bare-bones deal that does not allow UK airlines to conduct intra-EU flights. Ryanair\\'s UK subsidiary still stands to lose a share of the EU market and the Irish company urged London and Brussels to agree a more thorough interim deal. \"The risk of a \\'no deal\\' Brexit in March is rising and despite our robust post-Brexit structures including our post-Brexit plan around European ownership we continue to call for the UK and EU to agree a transition deal from March 31 2019\" it said in a statement. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday said there was \"still not sufficient support\" in parliament for her to bring her Brexit deal back to parliament for a third vote. \"As things stand there is still not sufficient support in the House to bring back the deal for a third meaningful vote\" May told parliament voicing hope that this could change later in the week. Mrs May last week negotiated a delay in the deadline for Britain\\'s departure from the European Union which was due this Friday. EU leaders agreed to an extension to May 22 if Mrs May manages to get Commons approval to the withdrawal agreement reached between Britain and the EU. The agreement has already been roundly rejected twice. If lawmakers defeat the accord again - if it is held - London must outline a new plan or face a no-deal Brexit as early as April 12 -- unless it decides to request another extension and hold European Parliament elections in May. There were several reports on Sunday that a Cabinet coup was in the making with several senior ministers insisting Mrs May must go. Some one million people on Saturday attended a massive march in London demanding a second referendum. The Commons is due to hold a series of \\'indicative votes\\' to gauge which Brexit model has most support among lawmakers. In her statement May said she is “sceptical” about whether allowing MPs indicative votes will produce a decision.\\xa0 Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said the time had come for Parliament to work together on a Plan B. He said the government’s approach to Brexit had become “a national embarrassment” and last week’s EU summit was another negotiating failure for May. Replying to questions Mrs May maintained her opposition to the holding of a second referendum or an early general election insisting that her purpose is to honour the referendum and deliver Brexit. \\xa0 Ebola epidemic in DR Congo now exceeds 1000 cases Israel launches strikes on Hamas in Gaza after rocket \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

London mayor Sadiq Khan has called for another referendum on Britain\\'s European Union membership saying the prime minister\\'s handling of Brexit negotiations had become \"mired in confusion and deadlock\" and was leading the country down a damaging path. Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29. But with Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit plans still not accepted some lawmakers as well as union and business leaders are increasingly arguing for people to have a final say on any deal struck with Brussels. May has repeatedly ruled out holding a second referendum following the vote two years ago to leave the EU. She says members of parliament will get to vote on whether to accept any final deal. But with time running out for London and Brussels to thrash out a Brexit deal the British government is preparing plans for a no-deal Brexit. Finance Minister Philip Hammond told senior ministers last week that Brexit could have to be delayed beyond March 29 in order to pass new laws The Sun newspaper said on Saturday. The idea was immediately rejected by May the report said. Khan a senior member of Britain\\'s opposition Labour Party said Britain was now facing either a bad deal or a no-deal Brexit both of which were \"incredibly risky\" for Britain. Writing in Sunday\\'s Observer newspaper Khan blamed the government\\'s handling of the negotiations and said the threat to living standards the economy and jobs was too great for voters not to have a say. \"The government\\'s abject failure – and the huge risk we face of a bad deal or a no-deal Brexit – means that giving people a fresh say is now the right – and only – approach left for our country\" he said. Khan\\'s support for a second referendum which supporters call a \"people\\'s vote\" will put more pressure on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to change his opposition to the idea. Labour is due to start its four-day annual party conference in a week\\'s time. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The United Kingdom should call a referendum to allow voters to choose between a no-deal Brexit and staying in a reformed European Union former Prime Minister Tony Blair said on Thursday. In a Reuters Newsmaker Blair said there was a 50-50 chance of getting another Brexit referendum as Prime Minister Theresa May will be unlikely to secure a majority for any divorce deal in parliament. He warned that whatever Brexit is on offer is going to result in significant economic harm and that European regulators would not want the centre of European finance to be outside their orbit. This would mean jobs would be lost in the financial sector. Blair served as prime minister from 1997 to 2007. Some members of May\\'s ruling Conservative Party are unhappy about the Brexit proposals she has made. The main opposition Labour Party has indicated it is likely to vote down any deal May brings back. May will meet ministers on Thursday to discuss Brexit hours after her parliamentary partner threatened to withdraw its support if she accepts what it calls a \"draconian solution\" on offer from the European Union.  One of the biggest hurdles is an agreement on the so-called Irish backstop to prevent the return of a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland if there is no immediate trade deal. A seamless border is part of the settlement which largely ended decades of violence in the province. After meetings in Brussels the Democratic Unionist Party which props up the Conservative government in parliament has issued a series of terse warnings to May. DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson condemned what he said was the EU\\'s offer for a backstop that would keep Britain in the customs union for an unspecified time-limited period would exclude Northern Ireland from any new British trade deals and see checks on goods moving from mainland Britain to the province. May\\'s acceptance of such a proposal \"would have implications not just for Brexit legislation – 50 per cent of which would not have passed without DUP support – but also for the budget welfare reform and other domestic legislation\" he said. \"She will not have DUP support regardless of whether the government tries to bribe bully or browbeat us into accepting it\" he wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Officials on both sides say much of a withdrawal treaty is complete but there remain serious differences over trade terms and the Irish border which European Union officials have said could still lead to the talks breaking down altogether. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

European stock markets jumped yesterday while the pound won a lift from better-than-expected UK jobs data as traders reacted to more Brexit chaos and awaited the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting. British Prime Minister Theresa May held crisis talks with her ministers after the Speaker of Parliament threatened to derail her EU withdrawal plan just 10 days before Brexit day leaving her strategy in tatters. British economic fallout from Brexit clouds was however offset by official data showing that the UK unemployment rate has struck a 44-year low at 3.9 per cent while wages continue to outpace inflation. “It appears that the labour market is still remarkably in rude health despite the ongoing calamity surrounding Brexit” noted David Cheetham chief market analyst at XTB trading group. In terms of market reaction there has been a little pop higher in the pound “In terms of market reaction there has been a little pop higher in the pound but the markets remain far more concerned with the latest on the Brexit front.” In the eurozone Frankfurt’s stock market powered ahead almost one per cent as a survey showed confidence among investors in Europe’s largest economy Germany leaped in March as fears of a hard Brexit briefly receded earlier this month and progress in US-China trade talks soothed nerves. The ZEW institute’s monthly confidence index yesterday added 9.8 points for a reading of -3.6 – still in negative territory but picking up the pace of recovery from a deep trough the indicator plumbed in October and November. It comes as German Chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday said she would struggle until the last possible moment to achieve an orderly Brexit saying the interests of Germany Britain and the EU were at stake. Focus yesterday turned also to the US central bank and its interest rate plans. The Fed is widely expected to hold fire today on another hike with observers predicting it will opt for just one increase this year as opposed to the two previously tipped amid global growth weakness and United States-China trade tensions. Oil prices meanwhile climbed yesterday one day after major oil producers led by Saudi Arabia agreed to keep working together to prop up the market but said they would decide only in June on whether to extend production cuts. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May drew widespread criticism on Monday after delaying a parliamentary vote on the Brexit\\xa0deal she appeared certain to lose heavily. The Opposition Labour Party said Britain now no longer had a functioning government. \"The government has decided Theresa May\\'s Brexit deal is so disastrous that it has taken the desperate step of delaying its own vote at the eleventh hour\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a statement. \"We don\\'t have a functioning government ... Labour\\'s alternative plan for a jobs first deal must take centre stage in any future talks with Brussels.\" Scotland Chief Minister Nichola Sturgeon said the Brexit\\xa0deal should have gone before parliament immediately so that it could be voted down.\\xa0 The postponement she said was \"an act of pathetic\\xa0cowardice by a government now collapsing under utter chaos\".\\xa0 The deputy leader of the DUP the N.Ireland party propping up the conservative government said he would not welcome a no-deal Brexit but was not afraid of one.\\xa0 The Northern Irish party said May needed to renegotiate her Brexit divorce or be replaced by someone willing to change course. \"What (the EU) need to be faced with is either somebody who is going to really make it clear they are prepared to walk away or a different Theresa May who will make that explicit\" Nigel Dodds told BBC TV. \"If anyone needs any further lesson or demonstration on how not to negotiate look at the shambles today of the government in the House of Commons having to pull a vote on something that they said was the only way forward.\" Ireland\\'s Prime Minister Leo Varadkar reiterated the EU\\xa0position that Britain cannot partially renegotiate the Brexit withdrawal deal which Mrs May agreed with the European Union though some clarification might be possible. \"The withdrawal agreement including the Irish backstop is the only agreement on the table. It\\'s not possible to reopen any aspect of that agreement without reopening all aspects\" Varadkar told reporters. \"I have no difficulty with statements that clarify what\\'s in the withdrawal agreement but no statement of clarification can contradict what\\'s in the withdrawal agreement\" Varadkar added when asked if Dublin would support a statement from the EU clarifying issues around the so-called Irish backstop. Mrs May is due to address the House of Commons at 4.30pm (Malta time) amid renewed calls for a second referendum calls which were strengthened after the European Court confirmed that the UK can drop Brexit. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn warned Thursday a no deal Brexit was a \"very serious and present\" risk and blamed Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s inflexible negotiating position. Corbyn met EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels one day after May also met top European Commission officials and as talk in London grew of a possible breakthrough in the coming days. A Brexit deal struck by May and the other 27 EU leaders in November was rejected by British lawmakers in January and since then she has struggled to thrash out a compromise over the so-called \"Irish backstop\" issue.\\xa0Progress in the ongoing negotiations could result in a fresh vote next week on May\\'s divorce deal Corbyn said he had \"useful informative and very frank\" conversations with Barnier and other EU officials outlining his Labour Party\\'s proposal that Britain should enter a customs union with the bloc when it leaves - an idea unacceptable to many Brexit supporters who say it would tie London\\'s hands on trade deals. \"The danger of no deal exit from the EU for Britain is a very serous and present one\" Corbyn told reporters afterwards urging May to soften her negotiating stance which he said was being driven by her Conservative Party\\'s ultra-Brexiteer European Research Group (ERG) of MPs. \"She is allowing herself to be held to ransom by a small group in her party called the ERG and that is some of the problem. She has got to change her ways otherwise the danger of a no deal exit with all the chaos that would cause is a very real possibility\" he warned. While Corbyn was travelling to Brussels British finance minister Philip Hammond raised hopes of a breakthrough in the coming days telling the BBC there had been \"some movement\" by the European Union.\\xa0 He said progress in the ongoing negotiations could result in a fresh vote next week on May\\'s divorce deal while Thursday will also see Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox hold \"detailed discussions\" with Barnier in Brussels. The stumbling block has been the Irish backstop which provides for Britain to remain in the EU customs union until a way is found - such as a future free trade deal - to ensure that Ireland\\'s border with Northern Ireland remains open. Brexiteers in the Conservative party warn that Britain may be trapped in the bloc indefinitely and have demanded a time limit or exit clause. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s economy will shrink if it leaves the European Union without a Brexit deal and it will suffer some damage whatever terms it agrees the International Monetary Fund said on Monday challenging the promises of some Brexit supporters. The Fund predicted Britain\\'s economy would grow by about 1.5 per cent a year in 2018 and 2019 - lagging behind Germany and France - if a broad Brexit agreement was struck. \"I\\'m a desperate optimist and I very much hope and pray that there will be a deal between the European Union and the UK\" IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said. But failure to get a deal would lead to a contraction she said. \"Let me be clear compared with today\\'s smooth single market all the likely Brexit scenarios will have costs for the economy and to a lesser extent as well for the EU\" Lagarde said as the IMF presented its annual report on Britain\\'s economy.\\xa0Compared with today\\'s smooth single market all the likely Brexit scenarios will have costs for the economy and to a lesser extent as well for the EU \"The larger the impediments to trade in the new relationship the costlier it will be. This should be fairly obvious but it seems that sometimes it is not.\" Britain is due to leave the EU in little more than six months\\' time but London and Brussels have yet to strike a deal to secure a transition period. Prime Minister Theresa May has struggled to bridge a deep divide within her Conservative Party about how close a relationship Britain should have with the EU. She is hoping to make progress towards a deal when she meets fellow EU leaders this week. British Finance Minister Philip Hammond speaking alongside Lagarde said the government had to heed the \"clear warnings\" from the IMF of a no-deal Brexit. Hammond has been criticised by some Conservative Party lawmakers who say he wants to keep Britain too close to the EU. Many Brexit supporters say Britain must distance itself from Brussels in order to strike its own trade deals with fast-growing economies around the world. The IMF said those kind of deals would not offset the drag to the economy from leaving the EU. Ruth Lea an economist with Arbuthnot Banking Group and a Brexit advocate accused the IMF of joining a new round of \"Project Fear\" a term Brexit supporters use for pre-referendum warnings of the economic consequences of a Leave vote. \"Did they learn nothing from their loss of credibility after Project Fear Mark 1? In other words stop making bold claims when you really don\\'t know what will happen\" Lea said on Twitter. Britain\\'s economy - the world\\'s fifth-biggest - slowed after the 2016 referendum decision to leave the EU and it continues to be outpaced by most other rich nations. However stronger-than-expected data last week showed the economy had its fastest growth in nearly a year helped by the World Cup and hot summer weather. The IMF said there was a \"daunting\" range of issues still to be dealt with before Brexit. Lagarde also said the IMF would lower its forecast for global economic growth when it updates its outlook in November. \"But I can say at this point without disclosing any numbers is that clouds on the horizon have not become lighter but darker\" she said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Brexit hardliner Boris Johnson called on Prime Minister Theresa May to rip up her plan for Britain\\'s departure from the European Union ratcheting up pressure on May as she prepares to face her divided party at its annual conference next week. The former foreign secretary who left the government over his opposition to May\\'s \"Chequers\" proposals later on Friday swerved the question of whether he might challenge her leadership. Just six months before Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29 2019 little is clear: May has yet to clinch a Brexit divorce deal with the EU and rebels in her party have threatened to vote down any deal she makes. Adding to the uncertainty a poll of polls published on Friday showed voters would now vote 52 to 48 per cent in favour of remaining in the EU were there to be another Brexit referendum. May has repeatedly ruled out another referendum. Johnson the bookmakers\\' favourite to succeed May said her Brexit plans would leave the United Kingdom half in and half out of the club it joined in 1973 and in effective \"enforced vassalage\". \"This is the moment to change the course of the negotiations and do justice to the ambitions and potential of Brexit\" Johnson wrote in Friday\\'s Daily Telegraph. Under the headline \"My plan for a better Brexit\" Johnson called for a \"SuperCanada-type free trade agreement\". He said the EU\\'s \"backstop\" proposals for Northern Ireland under which the British-ruled province would remain within the EU customs union even if the rest of Britain left amounted to the economic annexation of part of the United Kingdom. Johnson later declined to answer directly when asked if he would rule out a leadership challenge of the Conservative party. \"My job is to speak up for what I believe in and the vision that I have set out today and I believe in it very very sincerely and I\\'m going to keep going for as long as it takes\" he told the BBC\\'s political editor Laura Kuenssberg. FRINGE SPEECH May who voted to stay in the EU is trying to clinch a divorce deal with the EU while grappling with an open rebellion in her Conservative Party which convenes in the English city of Birmingham on Sunday for its annual party conference. May has repeatedly said her Brexit proposals are the only viable ones. Boris Johnson is scheduled to speak on Tuesday at a fringe event at the conference. More than two years since the 2016 Brexit referendum the United Kingdom its politicians and its business leaders remain deeply divided over Brexit considered to be one the most important decisions in post-World War Two British history. In the June 23 2016 referendum 17.4 million voters or 51.9 per cent backed leaving the EU while 16.1 million voters or 48.1 per cent backed staying. Some recent surveys have shown a swing towards support for staying in the EU. If there were to be another referendum researchers said a narrow victory for those hoping to reverse Brexit would be heavily contingent on getting those who did not vote last time to turn out. \"True Remain enjoys a lead in the polls. But that lead remains a narrow one and there is little sign of it growing\" said John Curtice Britain\\'s most prominent polling expert. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

With less than a fortnight until Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29 the Brexit process remains mired in uncertainty. Here are some of the ways it could play out: Short Brexit delay Prime Minister Theresa May last week agreed to ask the EU to postpone Brexit after MPs rejected her divorce plan for a second time while also ruling out leaving the bloc with no deal at all. Her preference was to try to persuade MPs to back her deal in a third vote before using an EU leaders\\' summit on Thursday to ask for a short delay until June 30. This time would allow the British and European parliaments to pass the legislation necessary for a smooth departure. That option now appears to have been taken out of her hands by House of Commons Speaker John Bercow who plays a key role in procedural matters in the chamber. He ruled on Monday that May could not keep putting the same deal to MPs again and again in the same parliamentary session. The rules suggest she could try again if she secures further changes from the EU. Solicitor General Robert Buckland suggested another way around the ruling would be to end the parliamentary session and start a new one before bringing back the deal - all before March 29. Longer Brexit delay If the deal is not approved by Wednesday May has warned the EU would likely demand a longer delay to Brexit to allow time to break the political deadlock. This would involve Britain taking part in European Parliament elections on May 23-26. The other 27 EU states must agree unanimously on any delay to Brexit but they are currently divided on how long it might be. Second referendum MPs last week voted massively against delaying Brexit in order to hold a second referendum. It was a blow to \"People\\'s Vote\" campaigners who see it as their best way to keep Britain in the EU. But if Brexit is delayed by many months the pressure for another public vote is likely to grow. No deal Despite the House of Commons vote against leaving the EU with no deal that remains the default option unless MPs can agree on an alternative and EU leaders unanimously agree to granting an extension. The prime minister says the options are her deal no deal or to stop the whole Brexit process. Some Brexit supporters argue that there is nothing to fear from leaving with no deal saying Britain would be free and still able to trade with the EU on terms set out by the World Trade Organisation. Others warn that severing 46 years of political economic and legal ties with the EU overnight would bring huge disruption. They also fear it could potentially upset the peace process in Northern Ireland if new border checks were imposed with Ireland. General election Some believe that parliament is so deadlocked that the only way out is another election. But when in January the main opposition Labour party tried to force a snap election with a vote of confidence in the government it lost as Conservative MPs rallied around May. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

There is \"no compromise\" on Brexit that commands majority public support in Britain with opposition to Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s deal the only point of agreement a leading pollster said Tuesday. \"No procedural or substantive option appears to be both widely popular and capable of bridging the Brexit divide\" said the University of Strathclyde\\'s\\xa0John Curtice. \"Our politicians are constantly being told that you should be seeking the centre ground.\\xa0Brexit has now become \"a new source of political identification\" transcending party loyalty \"The problem with Brexit is that the centre ground of politics is rather thinly populated\" he said presenting a report entitled \"Brexit and Public Opinion 2019\" in London. The report drawn from collated polls highlights the challenge facing prime minister May as she tries to resurrect the deal she struck with the European Union after if was comprehensively rejected by MPs. A slim majority of the public are in favour of her renegotiating the deal but none of the possible outcomes of that renegotiation enjoy majority support according to the polls. At either end of the spectrum leaving without a deal and holding a second referendum both command strong partisan support but largely cancel each other out on the national stage. A \"soft\" Brexit that seeks to remain part of some EU institutions appears to please neither side according to the report\\'s findings. \"A \\'soft\\' Brexit is a Remainer compromise that runs the risk of being little loved\" said Curtice. \\'Pronounced\\' division An ICM poll published on Sunday revealed that leaving with no deal was the most popular option when put up against another referendum a general election and May\\'s deal but still only commands 28 percent support. The campaign for a second referendum has gathered pace in recent months but Curtice found little rising public appetite. With public opinion so divided Curtice suggested that \"maybe the message our politicians need to take away is that to govern is to choose\". Part of the problem revealed by the polls is that Brexit has now become \"a new source of political identification\" transcending party loyalty making it a daunting task for political leaders to unite their traditional support base behind any plan. \"Only one in 16 people don\\'t have a Brexit identity whereas more than one in five have no party identity\" said a study by Geoff Evans and Florian Schaffner which was published in the report. The study cited figures showing that only 9 per cent of Remainers felt a connection with Leave voters compared to 21 per cent of Leavers who felt a connection with Remainers. A separate YouGov poll published Monday showed more than a third of Remainers would be upset if a close relative married a strong Leave supporter. \"Social polarisation is pronounced and shows no sign of diminishing\" concluded the study. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Waving European Union flags hundreds of anti-Brexit activists outside Britain\\'s parliament roared with approval on Tuesday as the government\\'s divorce deal was crushed by MPs. Massed in front of two big screens airing live coverage of the pivotal vote the crowd of fervent pro-Europeans erupted into cheers and clapping as the result was relayed. \"I\\'m so pleased -- but a bit concerned with what comes next\" retiree Sarah Cuthbertson 68 told AFP. \"I didn\\'t think it would be such a big majority against\" she said of the whopping 230-vote margin of defeat -- the largest ever in modern British political history. Nearby a smaller contingent of pro-Brexit activists were similarly cheered by the defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s deal but for different reasons. - \\'Everyone hates it\\' -\\xa0\"I\\'m ecstatic\" said Reg Kerr-Bell 55 a retired Londoner clasping a \"Leave Means Leave\" placard. \"No-deal is what I want to see now.\"\\xa0 But he conceded that parliament\\'s rejection of the government\\'s plan puts Brexit in some jeopardy. \"I\\'m very worried they (MPs) might try to hijack the process.\" Deploying flags floats and even a mock-up of the Titanic dubbed \"HMS Brexit\" hundreds of noisy pro- and anti-EU activists had descended on Westminster to make their voices heard ahead of the crunch vote. \"The only thing so far that managed to unite the country has been this deal and how everyone hates it\" Simon Fisher 25 told AFP draped in a \"Leave Means Leave\" flag. As opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn announced he had filed a no-confidence motion in the government pro-EU supporters urged him to go further. \"Unless he changes his stance on a second referendum I don\\'t think he\\'ll get people on board\" said Lesley Lacloche 61 who was draped in EU attire. Some waved signs and placards like \"Don\\'t Let May Betray the UK\" and \"Stop the Brexit Mess\". - \\'Brexit is a sinking ship\\' -Crowds converged on the square and street opposite the Palace of Westminster -- the formal name for the Houses of Parliament and grounds -- from the early hours of the morning under the gaze of TV cameras beaming the images around the world. In one of the more eye-catching displays pro-EU protesters reimagined the Titanic disaster erecting a cardboard ship iceberg and caricature of Prime Minister Theresa May on the bow beside a life-ring. \"Brexit is a sinking ship\" said Bert Wander one of the organisers.\\xa0 Demonstrators had lined the walkways around nearby makeshift broadcasting studios with each side staking out their camp and no mingling on show. \"I would have talked to them but because they are\\xa0abusive no\" said 65-year-old Sally Smith pointing to the pro-EU faction.\\xa0 The no-deal Brexit supporter had taken the day off work to come and make her point -- by frantically ringing a bell. In the opposite camp Louise Hummerstone a 66-year-old potter and craftswoman wearing an EU beret admitted that she had \"lost friends\" who voted Leave in the 2016 referendum.\\xa0 \"I can understand naive voters I completely understand people who believed the lies but I cannot tolerate those who voted for racist reasons\" she said. Despite the entrenched opposition the atmosphere remained mainly civil as large numbers of police looked on. However officers detained one pro-Brexit demonstrator after a face-off between the rival camps.\\xa0 The anti-EU protesters shouted \"scum\" at officers as they led the handcuffed man away. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British MPs have voted\\xa0 to play a bigger role in Brexit giving themselves the power to express their preference for different options in an unprecedented move that the government called \"dangerous\". MPs won a vote that will allow them to seize control of parliamentary business on Wednesday by 329 to 302 with three junior ministers quitting after voting against the government. Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt and health minister Steve Brine resigned a government source told AFP while business minister Richard Harrington\\xa0announced his decision to leave government on Twitter. In his resignation letter Harrington said the government\\'s approach was \"playing roulette with the lives and livelihoods of the vast majority of people in this country\". But the Brexit ministry said in a statement it was \"disappointed\" by the vote adding that it \"upends the balance between our democratic institutions and sets a dangerous unpredictable precedent\". Three years after Britain voted to leave the European Union Monday\\'s vote sets up a potentially crucial clash between government and parliament on the best way of ending a bitter political crisis. MPs will now have the chance to vote on various options such as revoking Article 50 and cancelling Brexit holding another referendum a deal including a customs union and single market membership or leaving the EU without a deal. But even if MPs decide a majority course of action the government is not legally bound to follow their instructions. \"The government will continue to call for realism -- any options considered must be deliverable in negotiations with the EU\" the Brexit ministry said. The prime minister earlier said she was \"sceptical\" about the process saying similar efforts in the past \"produced contradictory outcomes or no outcomes at all\". - \\'National embarrassment\\' -May admitted Monday she had still not secured the votes needed to get her own twice-rejected Brexit deal through parliament raising again the prospect that Britain could crash out of the European Union in just over two weeks\\' time. Anxious at the deepening crisis in London EU leaders last week agreed to postpone Brexit to avoid a potentially catastrophic \"no deal\" divorce on March 29 when 46 years of ties were formally scheduled to end. But they warned that unless May can persuade MPs this week to support her withdrawal deal Britain must come up with a new plan by April 12 -- or leave its closest trading partner with no deal at all. Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government was a \"national embarrassment\" adding: \"We will still face the prospect of a disastrous no-deal Brexit.\" The EU had earlier ramped up the pressure by announcing its full readiness to deal with the \"increasingly likely\" event of a no-deal Brexit in three weeks\\' time. - \\'Chicken who bottled Brexit\\' -The British parliament remains deeply divided over Brexit reflecting the sharp divisions in the country. MPs have already voted against a \"no deal\" Brexit but this remains the default legal position unless they agree an alternative. May went over her own Brexit scenarios at an emergency cabinet meeting earlier Monday. It followed a weekend of media reports that her own ministers were trying to oust her. Most of the alleged plotters are Brexit backers who fear the terms of Britain\\'s departure will be watered down or even reversed. \"Theresa May is the chicken who bottled Brexit\" former foreign minister Boris Johnson wrote in a weekly column for The Telegraph. \"It is time for the PM to channel the spirit of Moses in Exodus and say to Pharaoh in Brussels – LET MY PEOPLE GO\" he wrote leaving some room however for possibly supporting her deal. What happens to her premiership if parliament favours a more EU-friendly Brexit alternative that contradicts her policies is unclear. Parliament is thought most likely to rally around the idea of keeping Britain in a customs union with the European Union or its single market. Both of those policies contradict May\\'s position. A customs union would keep Britain from striking its own trade agreements with non-EU countries. A single market would require the government to go back on May\\'s promise to regain control of Britain\\'s borders and migration policy. \\xa0 Netanyahu at his side Trump proclaims Golan Heights belongs to Israel Italy\\'s \\'orphaned\\' Five Stars on brink of crisis  \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Updated January 16 10am Britain’s exit from the European Union was thrown into turmoil on Tuesday when the withdrawal agreement negotiated by the bloc and Theresa May’s government was soundly rejected by the House of Commons. In a major embarrassment for May MPs voted 432 to 202 to reject the deal just over two months before Brexit is due to take place. Those who voted against the deal included 118 MPs from May\\'s own Conservative Party.\\xa0  Mrs May will now face a confidence vote on Wednesday after the Opposition Labour Party tabled a no-confidence motion as soon as the scale of the government\\'s defeat was announced.\\xa0 Should she win that vote Mrs May is expected to hold talks across the House to seek consensus. \"We must focus on ideas which are genuinely achievable\" she said adding that she would then discuss them with the EU. The EU immediately warned that the vote raises the risk of a hugely disruptive \"no deal\" Brexit where Britain could sever ties with its biggest trading partner overnight. European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker urged London to \"clarify its intentions as soon as possible\" warning: \"Time is almost up\". EU negotiator Michel Barnier said he \"regretted profoundly the vote\" but that it was \"too early to assess all the consequences\". Ireland the only EU member state with a land border with Britain said it would now intensify preparations for a \"disorderly Brexit\". Rebels say they will back May in vote May struck a conciliatory tone after the vote promising cross-party talks to try and salvage a workable Brexit deal before returning with a new plan next Monday. Her own backbenchers rebelled in huge numbers but the ringleaders said they would vote for her in the confidence vote scheduled for around 1900 GMT which she is expected to win. \"We are going to vote with the government... of course the Conservatives are going to support the Conservative government\" leading Brexiteer Steve Baker told the BBC. The motion was tabled by Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn who wants to force a general election. May\\'s parliamentary allies in Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have led the charge against her Brexit deal but do not want a Labour government. However Britain\\'s newspapers were withering in noting the scale of her defeat a damning verdict on 18 months of negotiations with the EU. The top-selling Sun tabloid said May was \"crushed\" while the Daily Mail said her power was left \"hanging by a thread\". One commentator in The Times described her as a \"zombie prime minister\".

It prompts the resignation the next day of Conservative prime minister David Cameron who had called the referendum and led the campaign to remain in the EU. - May becomes prime minister - In a race to replace Cameron key Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson does not put himself forward as expected and May the interior minister who had backed remaining in the bloc becomes prime minister on July 13. On January 17 2017 May gives a speech setting out her Brexit strategy saying Britain will also leave Europe\\'s single market in order to control immigration. She warns she would be willing to walk away from negotiations with the EU saying: \"No deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain.\" - Exit process triggered - On March 13 Britain\\'s parliament gives final approval to a bill empowering May to trigger Article 50 of the EU treaty which lays out the process for leaving the union. With a letter to EU President Donald Tusk on March 29 formally announcing the intention to leave the government sets Article 50 in motion. Its two-year timetable for withdrawal puts Britain on course to exit on March 29 2019. - Lost majority - To capitalise on the perceived weakness of the opposition Labour party and strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations May calls a snap election for June 8 2017. Her gamble backfires as the Conservatives lose their parliamentary majority. They are forced to strike a deal with Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to govern. The issue of British guarantees to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit becomes a key sticking point in negotiations. - First terms agreed - Britain and the EU reach an outline agreement on December 8 on three key areas of the divorce: Britain\\'s financial settlement to the union citizens\\' rights and the Irish border.\\xa0 EU leaders give the go-ahead for the next stage of Brexit talks including on how Britain will continue to trade with the bloc after the split. A bill enacting the decision to leave the EU becomes law on June 26 2018. - Top ministers quit - On July 6 2018 May wins agreement from her warring cabinet to pursue \"a UK-EU free trade area\" that would retain a strong alignment with the EU after Brexit. But two days later David Davis the eurosceptic Brexit minister quits saying May is giving \"too much away too easily\". Johnson now foreign secretary resigns on July 9 becoming a leading critic of May\\'s plans. EU leaders meeting in Salzburg on September 19 and 20 tell May that her Brexit proposals are unacceptable and need to be reworked. - Draft deal agreed - The European Union on November 13 publishes contingency plans for a \"no-deal\" Brexit.\\xa0 But a few hours later May\\'s office says negotiating teams have reached a draft agreement for the divorce. On November 14 her cabinet backs the agreement.\\xa0 However the following day four ministers including new Brexit secretary Dominic Raab quit in protest. EU leaders approve the accord on November 25. \"This is the only deal possible\" says European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\\xa0 - Confidence vote - May\\'s deal faces intense criticism in parliament over the \"backstop\" provision designed to prevent border checks in Ireland. On December 10 May postpones a House of Commons vote on the deal due the following day acknowledging she faced a heavy defeat. She heads off to Europe for further talks but EU leaders reject any substantive renegotiation. On December 12 May\\'s Conservative party announces that enough MPs are unhappy with her leadership to trigger a confidence vote. But the embattled leader survives the challenge securing the backing of 200 Tory colleagues while 117 voted against her. The result meant May is immune from further internal party challenges for a year. - Parliament vote - The House of Commons Britain\\'s lower house finally gets its chance Tuesday to vote on the draft withdrawal agreement that May struck with EU leaders in December. With opposition parties and dozens of Conservative MPs all rejecting it for their own reason the government is defeated and Britain enters even more uncharted territory with the fate of Brexit itself up in the air. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: AFP  The Speaker in the UK Parliament has ruled out bringing Theresa May’s deal back for a third meaningful vote. Short of closing the current session of Parliament and starting a new one – and then actually winning the vote the likelihood is that the deal is now dead. The UK may now have no option but to request a long extension to the Article 50 process. The EU has rightly made it clear that any extension must have a clear purpose. Given where we are what would have to happen for a long delay and attempts at renegotiation to have any purpose whatsoever? Clearly a general election or a second referendum would be justifiable reasons for a long delay. But assuming those two options remain off the table and again who can possibly know is there any clear purpose for a long delay? As things stand today probably not. Neither the UK nor the EU seemingly have any intention of moving away from their position on the Irish backstop – the ‘irreconcilable difference’ that drives many divorces. While that remains the case no amount of delay will likely resolve the issue. There is a reason why the Irish backstop is unresolvable in the current negotiation. Understanding that may yet provide a way forward in any new negotiations. The origins of the current impasse can be traced to one action by the EU and the agreement to it by the UK: the decision to sequence the negotiations so that the Withdrawal Agreement was agreed first and is legally binding while the nature and shape of the future relationship was only to be the subject of a non-binding political declaration and then to be agreed later. This was a choice. There is no firm requirement in Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty that prohibits simultaneous negotiations. The net result of this sequencing has been the current impasse. The UK Parliament has not so far accepted a Withdrawal Agreement that leaves the future of the Irish border in question somehow to be resolved later. It puts the UK in an impossible position and weakens its hand in second stage negotiations. The framework of the negotiations remains the same as the one that has led us to the current impasse That the EU insisted on such sequencing is understandable. It strengthened the EU’s negotiating position and weakened the UK’s leverage. Neither I suspect was it envisaged at the time just how intractable the Irish border question would become. After all not only is the Irish question a peculiarly British/Irish question for which there is no parallel anywhere else in the EU but this was the first time that Article 50 had been invoked. Nobody had any previous experience of how such a negotiation would evolve. It is now time to recognise that no amount of delay will resolve this issue unless the sequencing is abandoned and the negotiations proceed to a single final agreement – withdrawal and future relationship – both legally binding. Whether the EU27 would be prepared to abandon such sequencing remains to be seen. But without it there is nowhere left to go absent a second referendum. Even then it would be foolish to be complacent that a second vote will reverse the Brexit decision. And a UK general election might not resolve anything except for the removal of Mrs May to be replaced by who knows who – possibly someone worse or much worse. Granted fusing the current sequencing and reaching a final comprehensive agreement may involve keeping the UK in the EU beyond the current budget cycle. This is a complication but not an irresolvable one. It is preferable to a delay that turns out to be pointless because the framework of the negotiations remains the same as the one that has led us to the current impasse.

Politicians who live in the real world are on the other hand necessarily focused on what is actually doable. And therein lies the Brexit peril we are now in. First let us be clear. If nothing is done then the default option we find ourselves in is that the UK will catastrophically for everyone exit the EU on March 29 with no deal. As the chips currently lie absolutely nothing has to be done in order for that to happen. That is the position that the British Prime Minister has put her country in. And let us be clear it is her doing and only hers. On the other hand for any option other than a no deal to be pursued something has to happen. In other words something active has to be done. This state of affairs puts the European Research Group (ERG) of anti-EU Tory MPs and their sympathisers (which may include the Democratic Unionist Party) in an extremely strong position. All they have to do to get their wishes of a no deal exit is to obstruct and make sure that nothing whatsoever can ever get done. That I would argue is a much easier goal to achieve than actually to get something done – a goal that requires bringing on board around a single preferred way forward a large number of Tory MPs opposition MPs from all parties 27 EU member states the European Parliament and the European Commission. And all to be done within a very few short weeks interrupted by the holiday season. Putting the country in such a position is the measure of the failure of the current Prime Minister. She succumbed to two major failings. The first is politicians’ commonest and seemingly unavoidable sin: putting short-term tactics ahead of a clear and sound overall strategy. The same sin that David Cameron committed when he promised a referendum in the 2015 election manifesto. If there was an overall strategy then it seems to have been to drag the whole thing out for so long that she could place parliament with its back against the wall and force it to back her deal for fear of a no deal exit. That strategy seems to be failing.\\xa0 The second sin is what might have driven the failing strategy: a total lack of emotional intelligence. An underestimation or total dismissal of the visceral deep-seated uncompromising nature of the forces ranged against her. A belief that in the face of looming catastrophe everyone would fold and she would emerge triumphant – even though through her Lancaster House speech and other repeated statements she did nothing but encourage the hardening of uncompromising positions possibly in the belief that she could string people along for long enough before the music eventually had to be faced.\\xa0 Nothing will work short of some radical and dramatic set of actions Resilient and hardheaded as she is it is possible that the Prime Minister may yet prevail. But the odds are shortening worryingly and dramatically. And they will shorten even further if her stubbornness leads her to stick to her own preferred set of options rather than giving way to take in the preferences of others whom she previously saw as her enemies (Tory Remainers the Labour Party the Scottish National Party etc) but who may now be her and the country’s only chance of salvation. What now? Nothing will work short of some radical and dramatic set of actions. Mrs May’s EU colleagues have rightly advised her to stop throwing red meat at the ERG wolves because she will only get eaten up. In spite of the challenge to her leadership and the clear evidence that there is no room for compromise there is still no sign that that advice will be heeded. Note the condemnation heaped upon Chancellor Philip Hammond when he dared to describe some of his Conservative colleagues (if one can call them that) as extremists. It’s as though some are still living in the fantasy world where the ERG faction can be cajoled towards a compromise so we mustn’t upset their sensitive souls too much. Other suggestions are flying in thick and fast. From a government of national unity proposed by Nicky Morgan to a pivot towards the Norway-plus option; to a new referendum. It does not seem to be in Mrs May’s nature to go for radical options or dramatic acts. Her technocratic instincts are strong seemingly leading to a belief that further tinkering will get her over the line. Far from being unhelpful her EU colleagues have made clear to her that that approach will not work. They rightly refuse to be party to it maybe hoping that in doing so they might encourage Mrs May finally to face the reality of her own parliamentary situation. Yes the ERG and their ideological kin have humiliatingly lost two very public battles. But faced with a timid and stubborn Prime Minister they may yet win the war.

The government did not oppose the motion but it was unclear whether its passage would force them to act.

The event was extremely well attended and saw the participation of over 80 delegates from different industry organisations seeking to relocate to different jurisdictions following Brexit. “Picking the right EU jurisdiction now that Brexit has been unleashed is going to be crucial not just for start-up managers but also for established industry players in the UK who will need a plan B to ensure continued use of passporting rights to distribute their funds to EU investors” FinanceMalta chairman Kenneth Farrugia said. “Brexit is likely to prove beneficial for EU jurisdictions including Malta which continues to experience growth of its funds industry not just on the fund licensing side but increasingly through the number of AIFMs being set up on the island.” The first panel during the seminar discussed the legal and fund structure consideration while the second discussed operational considerations and how Malta’s service provider infrastructure stack up; the third and final panel discussed the marketing and distribution of Maltese funds. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Prime Minister Theresa May bowed to pressure from Brexit supporters in her party on Monday accepting changes to her plans for leaving the European Union in an attempt to salvage her over-arching strategy. But by bending to the will of hardline Brexit campaigners she exposed her vulnerability in parliament where both wings of her party attacked each other highlighting the deep divisions that have so far hampered progress in talks with the EU. May has vowed to stick to her plan to negotiate the closest possible trade ties with the EU saying her strategy was the only one that could meet the government\\'s aims for Brexit the biggest shift in Britain\\'s foreign and trade policy for decades. But her plans have been criticised by pro-EU Conservative lawmakers with one former minister calling it the \"worst of all worlds\" while eurosceptics say the strategy will keep Britain firmly in the bloc\\'s sphere of influence. Brexit supporters had targeted the government\\'s customs legislation hoping to toughen up her plans to leave the EU. Instead of facing them down and fuelling tensions her spokesman said the government would accept their four amendments. The spokesman said the changes did little more than to put government policy into law. But by hardening the language to emphasise that the future collection of duties and taxes by Britain and the EU be on a reciprocal basis Brexit supporters may have made May\\'s plan less sellable to the bloc. For now her plans appeared still largely on track. READ: Sterling drops as May faces Brexit\\xa0pressure May denied a suggestion in parliament that her Brexit plan was dead and her spokesman said the decision to accept those amendments were \"consistent\" with the white paper policy document ministers agreed earlier this month. Where the government might struggle is explaining its acceptance of the demand that the EU must collect tariffs on Britain\\'s behalf if London is to do the same - a suggestion one expert said the bloc\\'s negotiators were unlikely to accept. The government\\'s acceptance of the amendments to the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill or customs bill also did little to ease the tensions in May\\'s party which is at war with itself over the Brexit plans. In one of the rowdiest debates in parliament on Brexit so far pro-EU Conservative lawmaker Anna Soubry said: \"The only reason that the government has accepted these amendments is because it is frightened of somewhere in the region of 40 members of parliament the hard no-deal Brexiteers who should have been seen off a long time ago.\" The battle over the amendments is unlikely to be the last that May and her team will have to face. May had to fight hard to get the agreement of cabinet ministers at her Chequers country residence earlier this month for her vision for Britain\\'s future ties with the EU. It was then undermined by the resignations of her Brexit minister David Davis and foreign secretary Boris Johnson. They and other eurosceptic Conservatives say the plan to keep close customs ties with the EU - which is only a starting point for a second phase of talks with Brussels - betrays her promise of a clean break with the 27-nation bloc after Brexit. From the other wing of May\\'s party pro-EU former education minister Justine Greening called on Monday for a second referendum saying it was the only way to break the stalemate in parliament over the best future relationship with the bloc. Greening branded May\\'s plan as \"a fudge I can\\'t support. It\\'s the worst of both worlds\". May\\'s spokesman said there would be no second referendum under any circumstances and restated her position that the Chequers plan was the only way to deliver a Brexit that worked in the best interests of the country. Another pro-EU Conservative lawmaker Dominic Grieve who has led previous efforts to get the government to soften its Brexit stance said the party needed to accept compromises \"or accept that Brexit cannot be implemented and think again about what we are doing\". \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British MPs will vote Thursday on whether to ask the European Union for an extension to the March 29 Brexit deadline with the whole process mired in chaos. It comes after MPs on Wednesday voted to reject a no-deal Brexit in an intense week of parliamentary ballots. The government will ask British lawmakers to endorse its plan to hold another vote on the divorce deal in the coming days and to request a delay whatever the outcome. The delay would be until June 30 if the Brexit deal is finally approved. But it has already been overwhelmingly rejected twice by parliament - in January and earlier this week. If MPs vote against the deal once again the government said the Brexit delay could be much longer and may force Britain to take part in European Parliament elections in May. Brexit has become deadlocked in the British parliament reflecting the deep divisions that remain in Britain almost three years after the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union. Any request for a delay would still have to go before EU leaders at a summit in Brussels on March 21-22. They have already stated that they will only agree to push back the Brexit date if Britain makes concrete proposals to break the crisis. Unless British MPs agree to the deal or EU leaders unanimously approve a delay Britain would still have to crash out of the EU with no deal in place on March 29. Guy Verhofstadt leader of the European Parliament\\'s Brexit committee tweeted that he is \"against any extension of Article 50 (the Brexit process) even for just 24 hours if it is not based on a clear majority from the House of Commons in favour of something.\" Embattled British Prime Minister Theresa May will also have to convince \"each and every\" EU country to grant any delay Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok stressed on Wednesday. \\'Negotiation finished\\' The series of votes has further entrenched the divide between the rival British camps both in the chamber and in the country at large as protesters of both factions once again gathered outside Westminster. \"Unfortunately our deceitful prime minister and many in her cabinet have tried to derail the Brexit process by never standing strong to the EU and saying if we don\\'t get a proper deal we\\'re just walking away\" said Brexit supporter Suzanne Hall 56. \"I think there needs to be a second referendum\" countered Christine Bobin 64. \"I don\\'t think people voted knowing what was going to happen.\" This week\\'s machinations in parliament come two years after Britain set the clock ticking on its departure from the EU following the 2016 referendum. May had hoped that last-minute assurances from EU chiefs on key sticking points in her deal chiefly the backstop proposal to keep the Irish border open would get it through parliament. However she was torpedoed by legal advice from her Attorney General Geoffrey Cox who said the changes would not allow Britain to leave the backstop of its own accord raising fears that the country would be stuck in an indefinite customs union with the EU. The EU\\'s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Wednesday said Brussels will not rework the painstakingly-negotiated withdrawal agreement. \"Why would we prolong the negotiation? To do what? Because the... negotiation is finished we have a treaty it\\'s there\" he said holding up the 585-page document. No-deal risk Barnier warned that \"the risk of no-deal has never been higher\". The British government on Tuesday said that in such an eventuality it would scrap tariffs on 87% of imports and would not apply customs checks on the border with Ireland. Anti-Brexit supporters are also buoyed believing that the failure of May\\'s deal and MP\\'s rejection of a no-deal exit brings the country a step closer to a second referendum or to stopping Brexit entirely. May gave them a boost on Wednesday telling parliament: \"We could leave with the deal which this government has negotiated but subject to a second referendum but that would risk no Brexit at all.\" MPs first rejected the Brexit deal in January by a historic margin of 230 votes. Though some eurosceptics changed their minds Tuesday\\'s defeat was still by a hefty 149 votes. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May will write to EU President Donald Tusk with a plan for delaying Brexit beyond March 29 her spokesman said Tuesday admitting the parliamentary deadlock had reached crisis levels. The letter will be sent before May heads to a Brussels summit on Thursday where she has already promised to seek what could be a lengthy postponement of Britain\\'s exit from the European Union. May had hoped to persuade MPs before then to back the divorce agreement she has struck with the EU but her plan to hold a fresh vote was dramatically blocked by the speaker of the House of Commons. Exasperated European leaders are now demanding London tell them clearly what it wants warning that the risk still remains that Britain could crash out of the bloc in 10 days ending its 46-year membership without formal arrangements. Michel Barnier the European Union\\'s chief negotiator warned on Tuesday that any extension of the Brexit talks would have \"political and economic costs\" for the remaining 27 EU states. \"A long extension... should be linked to something new a new element or new political process\" Barnier told reporters urging May to secure the backing of the British parliament for any request. \"How can we ensure that at the end of a possible extension we are not back in the same situation as today?\" he asked. May\\'s letter to Tusk would come by Wednesday her spokesman said as reports spoke of her seeking a 12-month delay. The British premier is struggling to keep control of the Brexit process after MPs last week decisively rejected her divorce deal for a second time. She has reluctantly accepted that Brexit must be postponed amid fears of an economic shock if Britain ends its 46-year membership of the EU with no new arrangements in place. But she said that if MPs backed her deal this week it might only be a short delay to ratify the text. This plan was scuppered on Monday when Speaker John Bercow delivered a surprise ruling that she could not keep bringing her deal back to MPs without changes. May had previously warned that without a deal the EU might impose a lengthy delay that could mean Britain having to hold European Parliament elections. Delay not automatic Pro-Brexit newspapers condemned Bercow as the \"Brexit Destroyer\". But May had been by no means certain of getting her deal through parliament this week as many Brexit-supporting MPs believe it keeps Britain too closely aligned to the EU. Talks continue with the aim of persuading MPs in her Conservative party and their Northern Irish allies the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to back the text. And there is speculation that any EU deal she strikes on delaying Brexit might be enough of a change to persuade Bercow to allow another vote on it next week. In Berlin German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: \"I will fight to the last hour of the deadline on March 29 for an orderly exit. \"We don\\'t have a lot of time for it but still have a few days.\" But an aide to French President Emmanuel Macron warned: \"An extension is not for certain or automatic.\" \\'Only deal on the table\\' The speaker\\'s ruling added further drama and complexity to an already chaotic Brexit process that has exposed deep rifts in parliament. MPs still cannot agree how to implement the 2016 referendum reflecting how voters remain divided almost three years after they voted 52 to 48% for Brexit. May continues to insist that her agreement covering citizens\\' rights Britain\\'s financial settlement plans for the Irish border and for a post-Brexit transition period is a good compromise. She sought and obtained clarifications on the operation of the so-called Irish border \"backstop\" to appease some of her MPs but some still want more. Several Conservative MPs suggested that following Bercow\\'s ruling May must now return to the negotiating table even at this late stage. However Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay warned: \"It is the only deal on the table from the EU - the EU have been consistent on that. \"Either we back the prime minister\\'s deal and get Brexit over the line or we risk either a softer Brexit or no Brexit at all.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The European Union\\'s top court ruled on Monday that the British government may unilaterally reverse its decision to leave the bloc without consulting the other member states. In an emergency judgment delivered just a day before the British parliament is due to vote on a Brexit deal agreed with the EU by Prime Minister Theresa May the Court of Justice said: \"The United Kingdom is free to revoke unilaterally the notification of its intention to withdraw from the EU.\" The ruling is in line with an opinion delivered last week by a Court legal adviser. That had boosted the hopes of British Brexit opponents that a new referendum could be held that would prevent Britain\\'s scheduled departure on March 29 2019. May faces heavy opposition in parliament to her Brexit deal and many expect her quest for approval to be defeated setting up further tense talks with the EU when she goes to Brussels on Thursday for a summit of national leaders. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

May\\'s move on the eve of the scheduled parliamentary vote opens up an array of possible outcomes ranging from a disorderly Brexit with no deal to another referendum on EU membership. May\\'s own position could be in jeopardy with calls from opposition parties for her to step aside. May said she still intended to put her deal to lawmakers. But she would first ask the EU for more \"reassurances\" over the main bone of contention: a \"backstop\" to ensure no hard border on the island of Ireland which her critics say means Britain could end up indefinitely subject to EU rules after it leaves. Announcing the delay May was laughed at by some lawmakers when she said there was broad support for the deal and that she had listened carefully to different views over it - the result of 18 months of tortuous negotiations. \"If we went ahead and held the vote tomorrow the deal would be rejected by a significant margin\" May told parliament adding that she was confident it was the right deal. \"We will therefore defer the vote scheduled for tomorrow and not proceed to divide the House at this time\" May said. The United Kingdom would meanwhile step up contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit when it is due to leave on March 29. Sterling skidded to its weakest level since April 2017 falling to $1.2527. It was trading at $1.50 on the day of the 2016 Brexit referendum. May accepted there was concern among lawmakers about the Northern Irish \"backstop\". The provision is intended as an insurance policy to avoid a return to border checks between the British-ruled province and the EU-member Irish Republic. But it also goes to the heart of the Brexit dilemma: allowing Britain to set its own rules outside the EU without disrupting trade. The backstop requires Britain to abide by some EU rules indefinitely - potentially long after it quits the bloc and gives up say in setting them - unless some future mechanism can be found to ensure a friction-free land border. That prospect is rejected both by supporters of a cleaner break with the EU and those who want to stay inside it. Brexit reversed? May said the broader question was whether parliament wanted to deliver on the will of the people for Brexit or open up the divisions in the world\\'s fifth largest economy with another referendum. \"If you take a step back it is clear that this house faces a much more fundamental question: does this house want to deliver Brexit?\" May asked. The leader of the opposition Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn said the United Kingdom no longer had \"a functioning government\" and called on May to \"make way\" for a Labour government. The decision to halt the vote came just hours after the EU\\'s top court ruled that Britain could unilaterally withdraw its decision to leave the bloc on March 29. The government did not spell out the mechanism for delaying the vote scheduled for Tuesday. The speaker of the lower house of parliament John Bercow called for lawmakers to be given a vote on the decision to defer the vote on the deal itself. \"I politely suggest that in any courteous respectful and mature environment allowing the house to have a say would be the right and dare I say it the obvious course to take\" Speaker Bercow said Watch: Lord of the Rings character Gollum returns... as Theresa May Jean-Claude Juncker and Theresa May. EU ruling Read: Four possible Brexit\\xa0scenarios - and how they would play out May\\'s Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt called the EU court ruling \"irrelevant\" because Britain will leave no matter what when scheduled on March 29. To do otherwise would disrespect the majority that voted to leave he said. In the June 23 2016 referendum 17.4 million voters or 52 percent backed Brexit while 16.1 million or 48 percent backed staying. More than two years since the 2016 vote the United Kingdom remains divided on how or even whether it should leave the club it first joined in 1973. Polls show few voters have changed their minds despite warnings of economic turmoil. Both May\\'s ruling Conservatives and the main opposition Labour Party are publicly committed to carrying out Brexit. A no-deal Brexit though is seen as so disruptive that parliament would be under strong pressure to block it. A growing number of backbench members of parliament say the only solution would be a new referendum an option backed by three of the four living former prime ministers but strongly opposed by the government. Michael Gove the most prominent Brexit campaigner in the British government said the court ruling \"doesn\\'t alter either the referendum vote or the clear intention of the government to leave on March 29\". \"We don\\'t want to stay in the EU\" Gove who serves as environment minister told BBC radio. Pro and anti-Brexit protesters argue opposite the Houses of Parliament in London. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The debate in the British parliament next week may provide \"spectacular options\" to unblock the Brexit crisis a top EU official said on Wednesday. \"There will be a huge debate in the British House of Commons next week and maybe a vote on (January) 29th and we need to have some options to work on\" EU Economics Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici told AFP. These avenues to end the Brexit stalemate would exclude a renegotiation of the existing deal he said \"but there can be new options maybe even spectacular options we don\\'t know.\" A former French finance minister Moscovici spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos where Britain\\'s deadlocked divorce from the EU was a main topic. The British House of Commons this month rejected a withdrawal deal negotiated over two years with the EU by Prime Minister Theresa May leaving Britain on course to exit the EU on March 29 with no deal. But May has promised a debate and votes on the way forward on January 29 with MPs mulling a long list of options including a second referendum or delaying the March 29 divorce date. \"Since the beginning our attitude is simple we didn\\'t want Brexit to happen. We feel that we are stronger with the UK\" Moscovici added. \"We think that the UK is much better inside the EU than outside the EU. While we respect the will of British voters we regret it\" he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

He did not exclude granting Britain more negotiating time - beyond March 29 - for concluding an agreement on the Brexit divorce terms but said it was now up to \"the British to take their responsibilities and assume the consequences of decisions they took democratically\" he said. The British government said Thursday that ongoing Brexit talks are focusing on securing new guarantees to reassure eurosceptic British lawmakers rather than on demanding that a divorce deal already concluded with the EU be re-opened. EU leaders insist the withdrawal agreement which they struck with Britain last year cannot be re-opened to appease British MPs who rejected it in parliament. Brussels however appears open to adopting a more ambitious political declaration that would set a roadmap for negotiating close EU-UK trade ties during a transition period after March 29. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

US trade with Britain will increase \"very substantially\" post-Brexit \\xa0President Donald Trump\\xa0predicted on Friday as a deadline looms for that country to leave the European Union. \"You know all of the situation with respect to Brexit and the complexity and the problems but we have a very good trading relationship with UK\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"We\\'re continuing our trade and we are going to actually be increasing it very substantially as time goes by.\" With Britain due to exit the EU next month London faces the prospect of losing the benefit of trade deals the EU struck with other economies which could raise tariffs and other impediments to the country\\'s exports. But the United States and Britain on Thursday announced two \"mutual recognition agreements\" to ensure the country will continue to be subject to the same criteria applied to the EU on rules for telecommunications and computing equipment pharmaceuticals inspections and marine equipment. In case Britain crashes out of the EU without an agreement on trade relations London has won agreements with Australia New Zealand Chile and Switzerland to ensure mutual recognition of standards in goods trade providing a bridge to new trading regimes for Britain outside the EU. Official figures this week showed the British economy posted its slowest growth in six years amid uncertainty over Brexit. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Malta favours a Brexit deal but the EU cannot move from the principles outlined in the proposed agreement Prime Minister Joseph Muscat told British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.\\xa0 Dr Muscat met Mr Corbyn during the European Socialist leaders’ meeting in Madrid according to a statement sent by the Labour Party. With just five weeks until Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29 Theresa May is yet to get the changes to her exit deal with Brussels she needs to secure its ratification in parliament. Ahead of a promised parliamentary debate and vote on the next steps on Brexit on February 27 Mr Corbyn is under intense pressure from moderates within his party to back a second referendum explicitly now that the terms of Brexit are known. Mr Corbyn a longtime eurosceptic has said Labour is focusing on securing an early national election before any possible resort to a second referendum. The Madrid meeting was used for the first vice president of the European Commission Frans Timmermans to formally launch his bid to take on the Commission's top job. Dr Muscat also held formal meetings with Romanian prime minister Viorica Dăncilă. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A man in Britain was jailed for 10 months on Thursday after sending threatening and racially aggravated emails to seven MPs who have previously opposed Brexit. Jarod Kirkman 51 admitted in court last week that he used a fake email address to send the \"malicious communications\" to various lawmakers. All the recipients supported remaining in the European Union in Britain\\'s divisive 2016 referendum - though some have since voted in favour of Brexit legislation. Kirkman from Luton just north of London sent the messages to Heidi Allen Sarah Wollaston and Nick Boles Conservative MPs who have all quit the party in recent months over its attitude towards the issue. Meanwhile his targets also included the opposition Labour Party\\'s shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman and prominent pro-EU MP Yvette Cooper as well as moderate Conservative lawmaker Nicky Morgan. Kirkman also pleaded guilty to a charge of racially harassing the black Labour lawmaker David Lammy. Jaswant Narwal from England\\'s state prosecution service said the sentence should serve as \"a warning to anyone thinking of sending threatening messages\". He added: \"Jarod Kirkman sent abusive emails from fake accounts believing his anonymity would protect him. \"The hate-filled abuse he sent seven MPs went way beyond any acceptable form of communication with people trying to go about their public duty.\" \\'End of my presidency\\': Trump reacts to special counsel appointment Journalist shot dead in N.Ireland in \\'terrorist incident\\' \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Malta is among the countries which would most suffer the consequences of a UK exit from the European Union according to ratings agency Fitch. The most exposed countries would be Ireland Malta Belgium the Netherlands Cyprus and Luxembourg all of whose exports of goods and services to the UK are at least eight per cent of GDP the agency said. \"The economic impact of Brexit would be lower for the EU than for the UK but would still be palpable. It would reduce EU exports to the UK although the extent would depend on the nature of any UK-EU trade deal and the degree and duration of sterling depreciation.\" Fitch said countries could gain from the shift of some FDI from the UK to the EU. However countries such as Luxembourg Malta Belgium and Germany with a large stock of foreign direct investment and financial assets in the UK would suffer losses in the euro value of those assets if there were a permanent depreciation of sterling. The banking sectors of Ireland Malta Luxembourg Spain France and Germany have sizeable links to that of the UK. Brexit could boost anti-EU or other populist political parties In its report Fitch said an EU exit by the UK would weigh on the economies of other member countries and increase political risks in Europe. \"We would not expect to take any immediate negative rating actions on other EU sovereigns if the UK left. But negative actions would become more likely in the medium term if the economic impact were severe or significant political risks materialised.\"\\xa0 Brexit would reduce the UK\\'s contribution to the EU budget (a net €7.1bn in 2014 after rebates) potentially to zero. This would imply that other net contributors would have to increase payments or net recipients accept lower EU expenditure. Brexit would create a precedent for countries leaving the EU. It could boost anti-EU or other populist political parties and make EU leaders more reluctant to implement unpopular policies with long-term economic benefits. Negotiating the terms of the UK\\'s exit could exhaust the EU\\'s time and energy and open up new fronts of disagreement. Brexit could shift the centre of gravity of the EU making it more dominated by the eurozone core poorer more protectionist and less economically liberal. If the UK were to thrive outside of the EU it might encourage other countries to follow suit. Fitch said Brexit could precipitate Scotland leaving the UK which might intensify secessionist pressures in other parts of the EU such as Catalonia in Spain. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British finance minister Philip Hammond apologised for describing the European Union as \"the enemy\" in the Brexit negotiations an embarrassing stumble for a man who is under fire from within his own party over his approach to the talks. In an interview with Sky News television today Hammond tried to quell the anger among some Conservatives who have accused him of taking too soft a line with Brussels. Pro-Brexit newspapers have this week called for him to be sacked. \"I understand that passions are high I understand that people have very strong views about this but we are all going to the same place we all have the same agenda\" he said in the interview on the sidelines of International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington. \"The enemy the opponents are out there on the other side of the table. Those are the people that we have to negotiate with. We have to negotiate hard to get the very best deal for Britain\" Hammond said. Shortly afterwards Hammond sought to limit the damage. \"In an interview today I was making the point that we are united at home. I regret I used a poor choice of words\" he wrote on Twitter. \"We will work with our friends and partners in the EU on a mutually beneficial Brexit deal.\" Hammond infuriated pro-Brexit newspapers this week and was criticised by some Conservatives including former finance minister Nigel Lawson for not agreeing to spend money now on preparations for the possibility of Britain leaving the EU without a deal. Speaking to media in Washington today Hammond declined to say whether he would vote for Brexit if there were a second referendum. Hammond campaigned for Britain to remain part of the EU ahead of the June 2016 vote. Echoing Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s own reticence on the issue Hammond declined to say how he would vote if another referendum were held now. \"We\\'ve had the referendum\" he told the BBC. \"You know how I voted in it.\" Earlier this week May declined to answer a similar question stoking concerns among Brexit supporters that she is not fully committed to taking Britain out of the EU. On Thursday May\\'s spokeswoman said the prime minister had full confidence in her finance minister. Hammond was forced into another U-turn earlier this year when he dropped a plan to increase social security contributions by self-employed workers after uproar among Conservative lawmakers who said it broke a 2015 election promise. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Almost one million EU nationals currently working in the UK are considering leaving the country in a potential \"Brexit brain-drain\" according to a new survey. Among those who said they were considering quitting Britain were 50% of EU workers with PhDs 39% with postgraduate degrees and 52% of those on higher incomes who were interviewed for the survey for KPMG UK. The survey of 2000 EU citizens found that 45% plan to stay in the UK after Brexit 35% are considering leaving and 8% have made up their minds to go. If all of those considering departure actually left it would reduce the UK\\'s national workforce by 3.1% - almost one million people - said the consultancy firm. Some 51% said they would like to hear a clear commitment from their employers that they want them to stay. KPMG\\'s head of Brexit Karen Briggs said: \"Our survey highlights how important the actions of employers are going to be if the UK is to avoid a Brexit brain-drain. \"Although almost half of the EU citizens working in the UK plan to stay what other EU citizens choose to do is definitely hanging in the balance. \"Against this backdrop we expect to see increased competition for talent between employers over the coming years and numerous firms seeking to supplement their workforce with AI (artificial intelligence) robotics and automation.\" Half (50%) of those surveyed said they felt less welcomed and valued in the UK since the Brexit vote and 53% said that the Government\\'s offer to protect their rights after Brexit had made no difference to their thinking. In a separate poll of 1000 EU citizens from countries supplying large numbers of workers to the UK some 49% said that the desirability of Britain as a place to live and work had fallen due to the referendum result. :: OnePoll questioned 2000 EU workers in the UK between July 14 and 31 and 1000 EU citizens living in Poland Ireland Romania Portugal Italy Lithuania France Germany Spain and Latvia between July 14 and 25. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said a transition period from the European Union after Britain\\'s exit from the bloc in March 2019 must not last more than two years. In an interview with The Sun newspaper on Saturday on the eve of the governing Conservative Party\\'s annual conference Johnson detailed four \"red lines\" for Brexit that appear to go beyond the agreed position of Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s cabinet. In addition to a two-year maximum transition he said the UK should not accept new EU or European Court of Justice rulings during transition must not make payments for single market access when the transition ends and should not agree to shadow EU regulations to gain access. Johnson also again strayed from his Foreign Office brief. He said Britain\\'s current national minimum wage of 7.50 pounds an hour rising to 9 pounds by 2020 was \"not enough\" and called for public sector employees to get a pay rise funded by layoffs. But he told the newspaper speculation about his leadership intentions had been \"massively\" overdone. \"Am I impatient about it (Brexit) do I want to get it done as fast as possible? Yes absolutely. Do I want the delay to go on longer than two years? Not a second more\" Johnson was quoted as saying in the tabloid newspaper. \\'Backseat driving\\' Some of Johnson\\'s cabinet colleagues recently accused him of \"backseat driving\" on Brexit after setting out his vision for the UK\\'s future outside the EU in a 4300-word newspaper article just days before a key speech by the prime minister. In her speech in the Italian city of Florence on Sept. 22 May outlined a transition period of around two years of trading on the same terms but no payments for single market access. \"The crucial thing I want to get over to Sun readers about Brexit is that it is going to be great and we need to believe in ourselves and believe we can do it. It is unstoppable\" Johnson said in the article on Saturday. However in an interview with The Times newspaper Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said that \"over optimism\" about Britain\\'s future outside the EU \"sells people short\" and called for \"serious people\" to take charge of Brexit. At the Conservative party conference in Manchester May will set out plans to build \"a road to a better future\" for Britain hoping to head off a rebellion over her handling of Brexit and her poor showing in the June election. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  The European Commission\\'s chief Brexit negotiator said today that no \"decisive progress\" had been achieved in the third round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels and that opening talks on the two sides\\' future relationship in October was unlikely. \"Over the course of this week we have made a number of useful clarifications on a number of points for instance the status of border workers\" Michel Barnier told a joint news conference with Britain\\'s Brexit minister David Davis. \"However we did not get any decisive progress on any of the principal subjects even though on the discussion we had about Ireland - that discussion was fruitful.\" Barnier scolded London for demanding the \"impossible\" - including having a say on the EU\\'s single market rules while being outside of it - in a series of position papers the British government released last week. He said both sides disagreed again today on the EU\\'s demand firmly rejected by Britain that the European Court of Justice must be allowed to police the enforcement of rights of EU citizens residing in Britain after Brexit and vice versa. \"In July the UK recognised that it has (financial) obligations beyond the Brexit date\" Barnier said. \"But this week the UK explained that its obligations will be limited to their last payment to the EU budget before their departure.\" \"Yet we have joint obligations to third partners... After this week it\\'s clear that UK does not feel legally obliged to honour these obligations after departure.\" Barnier made clear the EU\\'s and Britain\\'s positions on Brexit remained so far apart there was little chance the EU would agree to start talks about its future relationship with London as had originally been expected in October. \"Which such uncertainty - how can we build trust and discuss future relationship?\" Barnier said. \"We are quite far from being able to say that sufficient progress has taken place sufficient for me to be able to recommend to the European Council that it engage in discussions on the future relationship between the UK and EU.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May said she would not compromise with Brussels over her plans for Brexit as a media report said rivals in her party were set to publish their own proposal calling for a cleaner break with the European Union. With under two months before Britain and the EU want to agree a deal to end over 40 years of union May is struggling to sell what she calls her business-friendly Brexit to her own party and across a divided country. The EU has tentatively welcomed what has become known as the Chequers plan which is designed to protect cross-border trade but difficult negotiations lie ahead. \"I will not be pushed into accepting compromises on the Chequers proposals that are not in our national interest\" May wrote in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper. \"The coming months will be critical in shaping the future of our country and I am clear about my mission.\" The plan would keep Britain in a free trade zone with the EU for manufactured and agricultural goods. But some Brexit supporters have said that would mean parts of the British economy would still be subject to rules set in Brussels. Two of May\\'s most senior lawmakers - Boris Johnson and David Davis - quit as foreign secretary and Brexit secretary respectively in July in protest at May\\'s plan saying it did not go far enough and would let down the millions of people who voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum. According to a report in the Sunday Times newspaper leading Brexiteer lawmakers in May\\'s party are ready to publish their own plan for Brexit ahead of the party\\'s annual conference which begins at the end of September. That would be designed to heap pressure on May who needs to get any deal with Brussels through parliamentary votes in Westminster before Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29 next year.

Photo: Eric Vidal/Reuters  Financial\\xa0businesses have realistic expectations about serving European Union customers after Britain leaves the bloc next year and could deal with a so-called hard Brexit a top EU official said. The EU was not being threatening towards Britain by preparing for a possible “cliff edge” Brexit European Commission vice president Jyrki Katainen told reporters in Brussels. “It would be completely irresponsible to create an atmosphere where we can say don’t worry everything will go well and smoothly because we simply don’t know” Katainen said. The EU has told the financial sector to prepare for a smooth or hard Brexit even if the bloc’s aim is to obtain a good trade agreement with Britain he added. “The feedback from the financial sector itself is that they are prepared they are realistic not to take too much risk as their duty is to serve their clients” Katainen said. Many banks and insurance companies in Britain are applying for licences to open or expand hubs in the EU to avoid rupturing links with customers. After Brexit there is a big discontinuity in all the trade and services but we still have a large market “After Brexit there is a big discontinuity in all the trade and services but we still have a large market and it’s supposed to be an interesting opportunity for all the financial institutions” Katainen said. “Also in the future I suppose we try to keep interconnections between EU and UK-based financial sector” Katainen said. European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis told the same news conference he has not seen any financial instability due to Brexit and an orderly departure remains the baseline scenario. On Wednesday Britain’s finance minister Philip Hammond called on the EU to agree to a “mutual recognition” pact for financial services with the bloc and Britain accepting each other’s rules to avoid fragmenting markets. Brussels said a traditional free trade deal which typically does not include financial services is on the table. “Our existing trade agreements give a flavour of how it could look like but anyway it’s less than being part of the single market and it has an impact on the financial sector too” Katainen said. It was difficult to see how any UK sector would be better placed in the EU than it is at the moment Katainen said. “It’s the first time we negotiate a trade agreement in order to make trade conditions worse. Always when we negotiate with third countries the aim is to improve market access and regulatory environment and this time it’s the other way round.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The pound fell to an intraday low of $1.3223 on news that May had bowed to pressure from Brexit supporters and accepted their changes to a customs bill that underpins Britain\\'s exit from the EU. \"The move in sterling is pretty contained at this point but this [accepting of amendments] is being viewed by the market as a step towards a leadership contest\" said Jordan Rochester currencies strategist at Nomura. Eurosceptics say May\\'s plan leaves Britain too close to the European Union and are trying to force her to change course while pro-EU Conservative lawmakers say it leaves the country too distant from its biggest trading partner. Sterling has struggled to capitalise in recent weeks on signs that the economy is improving because of mounting uncertainty over whether Britain can secure a trade deal with the EU before it leaves the bloc next March. Markets expect the Bank of England to hike interest rates in August but the British currency has fallen 9 percent since April partly because of the wrangling within May\\'s party. May is expected to survive Monday\\'s debate on a customs law but the debate risks undermining the government and increasing the chances of an early election which would hurt the pound. \"Political uncertainty helps to explain why the pound has not strengthened yet on the back of the government\\'s plans for a softer Brexit\" said analysts at MUFG. At 1545 GMT the pound was down 0.1 percent versus the dollar at $1.3224 and down 0.3 percent against the euro at 88.52 pence. . Sterling finished last week down one percent against the dollar its biggest weekly drop since late May. President Donald Trump\\'s visit to the UK last week added to uncertainty about the Brexit talks and Britain\\'s trade relationship with the United States after the divorce. Trump criticised May\\'s handling of the Brexit talks. May attempted to face down would-be eurosceptic rebels by warning on Sunday that if they sink her premiership then they risk squandering the victory of an EU exit that they have dreamed about for decades. Meanwhile over the weekend German business groups told members to prepare for a hard Brexit. Long bets on sterling have been whittled down in recent days with overall net positions mildly bearish on the currency positioning data shows. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Rounding out a week of bad news for Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit plans petitioners argued successfully that legal certainty about the process is needed in advance of any British parliamentary vote because no country has ever withdrawn from the European Union. The Court of Session decision means the ECJ should say whether it is legally possible for Britain to stay in the world\\'s biggest trading bloc if and when the UK parliament so decides. Brexit continues to be mired in doubt after EU leaders cautioned Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday that unless she presented an alternative to her current proposals Britain would crash out of the EU without a deal. Jo Maugham a lawyer funding the judicial appeal described the Scottish court\\'s decision to refer the issue to the European court as an \"absolute bombshell\" for the government. London has argued that the question of whether Britain alone can stop Brexit is irrelevant since it does not intend to change its mind. The Court of Session disagreed. \"If Members of Parliament are to cast their votes in a responsible manner it is surely obvious that they should be properly advised as to the existing legal position so far as that may be relevant to their deliberations\" Lord Carloway said in his judgement. Britain\\'s Brexit ministry said it was \"disappointed\" by the decision and would carefully consider its response. \"As the government has repeatedly said we are committed to implementing the result of the (2016) referendum and will not be revoking Article 50 (withdrawal clause)\" a spokesman said. Friday\\'s decision could now theoretically face another appeal before the UK Supreme Court although legal sources close to the case believe that option is unlikely. Pro-European petitioners argued that while there is no legal doubt that Britain could stop Brexit with the permission of the other 27 member states it should seek to establish a legal right to do so unilaterally whether the rest of the bloc likes it or not. The lawmakers behind the challenge represent electoral areas in Scotland which voted strongly to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. The United Kingdom as a whole voted to leave. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

File photo: Reuters/Yves Herman.  EU leaders will not renegotiate Britain\\'s Brexit deal including the Irish border \"backstop\" Donald Tusk said on Monday after Prime Minister Theresa May put off a parliamentary vote on a package that was facing heavy defeat. EU officials said European Council President Tusk could meet May as early as Tuesday to prepare talks on Brexit during a regular Brussels summit which May will attend on Thursday and Friday. Tusk said he had scheduled a meeting of the other 27 leaders on Brexit to be held at some point during the summit. \"We will not renegotiate the deal including the backstop\" he said on Twitter after May said she would go back to European neighbours to seek new reassurances about the insurance clause which would bind Britain into a customs union with the EU in order to avoid a \"hard\" EU border for troubled Northern Ireland.

They might agree to tweak the accompanying non-binding political declaration on future relations though even that was doubtful. Finally they could issue a new declaration of intent to try and help May. Tusk said only: \"We are ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratification.\" But he also warned that the EU would forge ahead with preparing for there being no deal at all as it faces a Britain that seems incapable of forging a majority opinion on what kind of Brexit it wants - or even if it wants to leave at all. \"As time is running out we will also discuss our preparedness for a no-deal scenario\" Tusk said referring to the fact that Britain will be out of the bloc on March 29 according to a treaty timetable with or without a deal. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Friday that \"every effort\" must be made to find a way through the Brexit condundrum ahead of a crucial vote next week by British lawmakers. Prime Minister Theresa May is facing defeat when MPs vote Tuesday on her draft divorce deal which has aroused fierce opposition from EU supporters and Brexit enthusiasts alike. Brussels and London are in \"constant\" contact to see what assurances the EU can give to persuade British MPs to back the deal Juncker said but he reiterated the oft-repeated warning that the deal struck in November is not up for renegotiation. \"We are in constant contact - the commission and myself - with 10 Downing Street and we will see on Tuesday what conclusions the British parliament reaches on the texts that have been proposed\" Juncker said at a press conference in Bucharest to mark the start of Romania\\'s stint at the helm of the rotating EU presidency. \"No deal would be a catastrophe both for our British friends and for continental Europeans so every effort must be made between now and Tuesday to bring this important issue to a good conclusion.\" May under increasing pressure to rule out a \"no-deal\" Brexit in which Britain crashes out without an agreement with the EU to ensure a smooth orderly departure on Thursday repeated her warning that the only way to ensure this was to back her deal. Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs are opposed to the deal arguing it leaves the country too closely tied to Europe and May has already pulled the vote once with defeat looming. Asked about reports of a letter to London offering assurances about the controversial Irish \"backstop\" arrangement which has inflamed Brexiteer MPs Juncker said he would not get into \"speculation and guessing games\". \"We have said - both the European Council and the commission in full harmony - that there can be no renegotiation but there can be clarifications\" Juncker said. \"We are in the process of seeing with Downing Street what these clarifications might be but this should not be confused with renegotiation particularly when it comes to the backstop.\" May wants further assurances from Brussels on the temporary nature of the backstop which could see Northern Ireland continue to follow certain EU trade rules after Brexit to avoid border checks with Ireland. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May launched a new diplomatic push to avert a no-deal Brexit and secure a new delay to the date for leaving the bloc. Sterling bobbed briefly above $1.31 in late morning foreign exchange deals but then fell back against both the dollar and the pound. “In a clear example of how headline driven the pound is at present there’s been a swift move higher and just as quick a drop back lower as the latest round of Brexit rumour and counter-rumour hit the news wires” said David Cheetham an analyst with XTB. He cited reports later denied that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was willing to grant a five-year time limit on the backstop which saw traders rush to buy the pound in anticipation of a breakthrough. “However the gains were fleeting and they were promptly handed back when it was confirmed the reports were untrue and we can expect more of this sort of thing in the coming days” Cheetham predicted. Belgium said yesterday it is to host a mini-summit of the European Union members most exposed to the dangers of a no-deal Brexit tomorrow. Also yesterday the IMF issued a stern warning saying a “no-deal” Brexit would send the British economy into severe shock. In a whirlwind tour the British premier met Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin and President Emmanuel Macron in Paris in a last-gasp bid to keep her country from crashing out on Friday. The pound is set for “another wild week” amid uncertainty about the outcome of the talks said FXTM analyst Lukman Otunuga. “When dealing with Brexit one should always expect the unexpected and this will remain the mantra until more clarity is provided” he said. European and US stock markets meanwhile dropped as traders detected cooler relations between the United States and China over trade than they had previously hoped for with flaring trade tensions between the US and the European Union adding to worries. President Donald Trump yesterday lashed out at the EU vowing to slap tariffs on billions in EU imports in retaliation for subsidies to aviation giant Airbus. Markets meanwhile remain on tenterhooks on the eve of the European Central Bank’s interest rate decision – and publication of the United States Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes.

British Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday prepared to head to Brussels for talks on the Brexit crisis even though EU leaders have refused any renegotiation of the deal she agreed with them in December. With just five weeks to go until Brexit on March 29 the deal has been blocked by the British parliament and the country appears headed for a chaotic exit that economists warn will wreak havoc in both Britain and the European Union. May is due to meet European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker at 1730 GMT on Wednesday two days after Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox visited the EU headquarters. The visit also comes a day before Jeremy Corbyn leader of the opposition Labour Party is expected to meet the EU\\'s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier as part of a diplomatic ballet aimed at heading off a no-deal Brexit. May\\'s spokesman said the prime minister was \"working hard to secure legally binding changes\" to the backstop -- a controversial part of the withdrawal agreement she signed with EU leaders at a summit in December. The backstop would keep Britain in the EU customs union and give Northern Ireland a different economic status from mainland Britain until a way is found to ensure there is no return to a hard border with EU member Ireland. The deal was overwhelmingly rejected by British MPs last month in a vote that united Conservative pro-EU moderates and Brexit hardliners in opposition. May has since said she will seek to renegotiate the deal to the dismay of European allies who have repeatedly warned her against using time pressure in an attempt to extract concessions. \"The EU need to work with us in order to give parliament the insurance it needs\" May\\'s spokesman said adding: \"The prime minister believes that she can secure changes in relation to the backstop MPs want -- there is a majority in parliament for a deal\". May\\'s critics accuse her of wasting time before holding another vote in parliament on her deal hoping that the looming deadline will change MPs\\' minds. \\'Running down the clock\\' Speaking at a manufacturing conference in London Corbyn said May was being \"extraordinarily reckless\" in her Brexit strategy. \"This government is running down the clock\" he said. The Labour leader promised that his party would \"keep all options on the table including the option of a public vote\". A lifelong eurosceptic Corbyn has come under intense pressure from within his party to push more forcefully for a second referendum. He has instead urged May to agree to negotiate for Labour\\'s Brexit plan which would involve agreeing to Britain staying permanently in the EU customs union. EU leaders have repeatedly said they will not renegotiate the legally-binding withdrawal agreement but could make changes to an accompanying political declaration with more long-term trade aims. \"We cannot accept a time limit to the backstop or a unilateral exit clause\" Juncker\\'s spokesman Margaritis Schinas said on Tuesday. But former European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso told a Euronews Brexit conference in London that the EU could pull off an \"impossible\" compromise. \"It is possible with some creativity and imagination to find some kind of compromise\" he said. \"There is still some room for negotiation.\" He added that \"the European Commission has a remarkable capacity to find compromises that seem impossible until they are done.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A vote to leave the EU against Scotland\\'s will would \"almost certainly\" trigger another independence referendum Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned. Ms Sturgeon said there would be an \"inescapable\" shift in public opinion towards independence to guarantee Scotland\\'s continued EU membership. And it is \"inevitable\" that people who voted No in 2014 would change their minds she added. She also warned leaving the EU would see the Conservative government \"unfettered\" to water down UK employment rights and social protections. Ms Sturgeon was asked if a vote to leave the EU against the majority will of the people of Scotland would definitely trigger another independence referendum on the BBC\\'s Andrew Marr Show. She replied: \"Almost certainly. \"I think that would be the demand of people in Scotland. \"Let me say very clearly that I don\\'t want this scenario to arise. I hope the UK as a whole votes to stay in the EU for a whole variety of different reasons. \"But if you cast your mind back to the Scottish referendum the No campaign then said if Scotland voted Yes then our membership of the EU would be at risk. That was rubbish then but that was a key argument. \"If a couple of years later we find ourselves having voted to stay in the EU being taken out against our will I think there will be many people - including people who voted No in 2014 - who would say the only way to guarantee our EU membership is to be independent. \"That I think is inescapable.\" She added: \"I personally know people who were passionate in their No vote in 2014 who would change their minds if we were in that scenario. \"That I think is just something that is inevitable.\" Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that an independent Scotland in the EU would have to negotiate its border arrangements if the remainder of the UK was outside the EU. She added that said she has \"no proposals\" to use her new devolved powers to top up benefits for migrants but said EU migrants have had a positive impact on the UK economy. She also spoke of her fears for employment rights and social protections under the Tories if the UK leaves the EU. \"David Cameron seems to want an EU where the social and employment protections that it brings are watered down\" she said. \"For me these are parts of the reasons for being in the EU and one of the reasons why it would worry me greatly if the UK was to come out of the EU as we would then have David Cameron\\'s majority Conservative government unfettered when it came to employment rights or social protections.\" She said Mr Cameron should \"think twice\" about coming to Scotland to make his case for remaining in the EU. \"In the independence referendum we used to be overjoyed when he made a foray into Scotland to campaign there because we thought it ratcheted up votes for the Yes campaign\" the First Minister said. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: \"It is no surprise that Nicola Sturgeon favours independence for Scotland but she is too keen to talk up a defeat in the EU referendum to advance her cause. \"It is welcome that Nicola Sturgeon supports remaining in the EU but we need her to support the campaign 100% rather than using every opportunity to talk abut what happens if we lose. \"The EU referendum campaign must not be used as a proxy campaign for independence. The EU debate deserves a laser-like focus just like the independence debate. With economic social and security benefits the European Union is good for the UK.\"\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Despite polls throughout the campaign indicated a neck to neck race investors were quite confident that U.K. voters were more inclined towards the remain vote.In fact this was clearly visible in the latest market movements primarily over the past four days in which the risk-on button was triggered as markets were being more convinced of a remain vote. The FTSE 100 gained confidence with a circa 2.16 per cent gain the DAX in Germany gained 4.7 per cent while European High yield debt gained momentum with gains close to 0.61 per cent.Surprisingly enough and to many against all odds voters opted in exiting the European community despite the huge economic implications that the exit would trigger. All throughout the counting phase the leave voters were leading the run with the currency market kicking a declining phase with Sterling plunging to circa 8.5 per cent against the dollar while the FTSE 100 plummeted by 9.5 per cent.Indeed we are expecting a harsh sell-off throughout the day and possibly further losses in the coming days as investors are fleeing towards safe heavens. This morning the 10-year German Bund touched new lows gold appreciated by around 5 per cent this morning while safe heavens currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc also gain ground.The Bank of England this morning issued a statement early this morning stating that it will take all the necessary steps to meet its monetary and financial stability mandate. This might offer some investors some sort of comfort but in my view at this stage the market is in a shocking phase and probably any statement by any monetary politician will barely prickle any comfort amongst investors.In my view at this stage investors shouldn’t panic and get carried away by the market sell-off. Despite further declines might be expected in the coming days investors should time their exit points rationally. Undoubtedly the possible slight upward movements might offer this exit opportunity. On the contrary for the risk-taking traders the remarkable downward correction might be the appropriate opportunity to lock in some short-term gains.

Photo: Reuters  New UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he would assure his EU counterparts today that Britain would continue to cooperate closely with them once it leaves the bloc following last month\\'s Brexit referendum. \"The message I\\'ll be taking to our friends in the council is that we have to give effect to the will of the people and leave the European Union but that in no sense means that we are leaving Europe\" the Brexit campaigner told reporters on arrival at an EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels. \"We are not going to be in any way abandoning our leading role in European cooperation and participation of all kinds\" added Johnson a former Brussels-baiting journalist who was on his first foreign trip since being appointed in a surprise move last week by new UK Prime Minister Theresa May. Johnson yesterday met EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini with both stressing their meeting had been held in good spirits discussing a joint response to the failed coup in Turkey and the militant attack in Nice. \"On Turkey I think it\\'s very important in view of the failed coup that we see restraint and moderation on all sides and that\\'s what I\\'ll be calling for\" Johnson said. Asked how ministers would find working with Johnson who during the Brexit campaign compared the EU to Hitler\\'s plan to dominate Europe Mogherini simply said her exchange with him on Sunday evening had been \"very positive\". She stressed that Britain remained a member of the European Union and that there would be no negotiation of the terms of Brexit until London notifies formally that it is leaving under the terms of Article 50 of the EU treaty. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The European Union on Friday summoned leaders to an extraordinary summit warning that Britain is now \"likely\" to crash out of the bloc on April 12 without a Brexit deal. \"In view of the rejection of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons I have decided to call a European Council on 10 April\" tweeted Donald Tusk the head of the European Council. Almost immediately after the House of Commons voted to reject the withdrawal agreement an EU Council official said Brexit would be postponed until April 12 as decided at a summit last week. Britain\\'s Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to draw up an alternative plan for an orderly Brexit before then and will be asked to present it to her 27 EU colleagues at the emergency summit. \"We expect the UK to indicate a way forward before then well in time for the European Council to consider\" the Council source said adding that May would be invited to \"the beginning of the meeting.\" Separately a spokeswoman for the European Commission -- the bloc\\'s executive -- increased pressure on London to come up with a plan for an orderly Brexit by warning of an abrupt divorce. \"A \\'no-deal\\' scenario on 12 April is now a likely scenario. The EU has been preparing for this since December 2017 and is now fully prepared for a no-deal scenario at midnight on April 12\" she said. \"The EU will remain united. The benefits of the Withdrawal Agreement including a transition period will in no circumstances be replicated in a no-deal scenario. Sectoral mini-deals are not an option.\" Kosovo bans gambling after casino murders  Massive protests in Algeria as activists demand president step down \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The British government could tell citizens to change their diets if importing food from the European Union becomes difficult under a no-deal Brexit a report said. London has begun planning what to do about food supplies if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement with Brussels The Times said citing plans revealed to the newspaper. Perishable goods such as vegetables from the Netherlands or fruit from Spain could be held up at the border if tough checks are imposed or the EU limits trade said the report. It said the government had identified giant hangars around the country that could be used to stockpile food. However officials do not think there would be a general food shortage according the report. Some companies have begun taking matters into their own hands. The Zizzi and ASK restaurant chains will be switching from Italian to British mozzarella suppliers. The brands' parent company Azzurri said it had taken the decision due to fears that a no-deal Brexit would disrupt food supplies into Britain. The new Welsh milk mozzarella has already been introduced by ASK and will be on the Zizzi menu next year. Meanwhile businesses including Premier Foods Quorn and London's plush Fortnum and Mason emporium have said they will stockpile some products in case of delays at the border. The British government and Brussels have struck a withdrawal agreement that would prevent a no-deal Brexit. However it currently lacks majority support in the British parliament being opposed by both Brexiteer lawmakers and pro-EU MPs alike. The government has stepped up its no-deal planning. Prime Minister Theresa May has said the vote on the deal will take place the week of January 14. Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Brexit is a soap opera that has become rather dreary Labour MEP former prime minister and author of novels Alfred Sant told the European Parliament on Wednesday. Speaking in a debate in Strasbourg hours after the Brexit deal between the UK and the EU was struck down by British law-makers Dr Sant argued that the negotiations between the EU and the UK were flawed. The UK should have been asked first to clear as a matter of principle and policy what future relationship it sought he said. And the EU should have indicated what relationship it found acceptable. Agreement would then have been sought on this. Negotiations between the EU and the UK would have been about proceeding from the status of membership to that of the proposed new relationship. \"Instead another episode is being played in a soap opera that frankly has become rather dreary\" he said.\\xa0 Dr Sant said the impasse that faces the EU and the UK results from the deeply flawed method by which the Brexit negotiations had been conducted. The negotiations had been designed in two sequences: first to establish the conditions for an orderly withdrawal; then those of a future relationship. Aggravated by huge political fractures on the British side and the steely determination to maintain unity on the EU side this approach had been driving both sides towards a brick wall. “A divorce process can only be well managed if not just the terms for a separation but also those of any alternative future relationship are mapped out. The two sets of terms are interdependent as is shown by the ongoing controversies within the British political system regarding whether Brexit should be hard or soft” he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

If Prime Minister Theresa May allows Brexit to be watered down or halted by supporters of European Union membership Britain will be thrust into its gravest constitutional crisis since World War Two Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage said. Farage who as UKIP leader convinced Prime Minister Theresa May’s predecessor David Cameron to call the Brexit referendum and then helped lead the campaign to leave the EU said Brexit was now in danger of being scuttled by the establishment. The 53-year-old former commodities trader cast May who voted to stay in the EU as \"Theresa the appeaser\" for giving in to Brussels on almost every element of Brexit negotiations and said Britain was being humiliated by the EU. \"The best-case scenario right now under our current pathetic leadership is Brexit in name only - that is about as good as it gets\" Farage told Reuters in his office a few metres from Westminster Abbey. \"At worst they are going to make us fight the whole thing again\" said Farage. \"That is a significant betrayal of what many millions voted for.\" In the United Kingdom\\'s 2016 referendum 51.9 percent or 17.4 million people voted to leave the EU while 48.1 percent or 16.1 million voted to stay. Farage was once ridiculed by Cameron as the leader of a bunch of \"fruitcakes and loonies and closet racists\". A supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump he revels - between jokes and cigarettes - in the role he played in what he calls the \"Brexit revolution\". \"CRUNCH POINT\" He dismissed worries from major banks such as Goldman Sachs that the City of London could lose business as a result of Brexit and cast the European Union as a doomed German-dominated experiment in European integration. Since the referendum supporters of EU membership have been exploring a range of legal and political methods to prevent what they see as a colossal historical mistake. May whose government and party is divided over Brexit has just eight months to strike a withdrawal deal with the EU but insists Britain will leave at 2300 GMT on March 29 2019. Opponents of Brexit are trying to garner enough support in the lower house of parliament the House of Commons to block any possible withdrawal deal May brings back from Brussels in October. \"The real crunch point is ultimately going to be the meaningful vote in the House of Commons on whatever deal we get and that is the point at which it is not impossible to see this country plunged into a constitutional crisis\" Farage said. \"The chances of this being the case get higher with every week that goes by\" he said. \"If the deal is rejected on a confidence motion then you are looking at general elections or you are looking at another referendum.\" French President Emmanuel Macron and European Council President Donald Tusk have raised the prospect of Britain changing its mind on Brexit. Among those who have called for Brexit to be halted are former Prime Minister Tony Blair Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and George Soros who made a huge fortune by betting against the British pound in 1992. Asked about the three Farage laughed: \"If I was drafting a horror movie of what remainers look like well here they are.\" SOROS OR RUSSIA? Trump he said was doing very well as president and described allegations of links to Moscow as hysteria. \"This Russia inquiry is one of the biggest hoaxes we have seen in our lifetimes\" Farage said scoffing at claims about his own links to Russia or Russia\\'s supposed role in Brexit. \"It is complete and utter total complete rubbish\" he said. \"I may have drunk a vodka once but I have never been to Russia.\" Farage said that instead of Russia Soros should be investigated. The Hungarian-born billionaire\\'s foundations have pledged large sums to Best for Britain and other pro-EU groups. \"There does need to be an investigation into the extent that George Soros is undermining politics right across the Western world\" Farage said. \"This is the biggest political campaigning organisation the world has ever seen and most people are in denial about it.\" He dismissed criticism from some British commentators that accusing Soros of a conspiracy had shades of anti-Semitism: \"What? We cant criticise the man because he happened to come from a Jewish background? He is not Jewish - he is an atheist.\" A Soros spokesman declined to comment on Farage\\'s remarks. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May held crisis talks with her ministers Tuesday after the speaker of parliament threatened to derail her EU withdrawal plan just 10 days before Brexit day leaving her strategy in tatters. May is still hoping she can get the divorce agreement she struck with the European Union through parliament before March 29 despite MPs having rejected it twice. But in a dramatic ruling that prompted fury in government and warnings of a constitutional crisis House of Commons speaker John Bercow said on Monday he could not put it to another vote in its current form. Weeks of chaotic political deadlock in parliament have already forced May to concede that Brexit must be delayed amid fears of an economic shock if Britain ends its 46-year membership of the EU with no new arrangements in place. But she had been hoping to ask EU leaders for only a short delay when they meet at a Brussels summit on Thursday warning that without a deal any extension would be lengthy. \\'Brexit destroyer\\' Pro-Brexit newspapers in Britain condemned Bercow as the \"Brexit Destroyer\" and reports suggested May is now planning to ask for a 12-month delay. \"The reality is the best way to deliver on Brexit is to back the prime minister\\'s deal\" Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay told the BBC. He said cabinet ministers would discuss Bercow\\'s ruling at their weekly meeting on Tuesday. Meanwhile in Brussels EU ministers preparing for this week\\'s summit wait to see the fallout. \"There is less clarity today than yesterday\" said George Ciamba minister delegate for European affairs for Romania which holds the rotating EU presidency. \"We are going to adopt a number of contingency measures for the worst case scenario the worst case scenario being that Britain leaves without an agreement.\" \\'Only deal on the table\\' The speaker\\'s ruling adds further complexity to an already chaotic Brexit process that has exposed deep rifts in parliament. MPs still cannot agree how to implement the 2016 referendum to leave the EU and voters remain divided almost three years after they voted 52 to 48 per cent for Brexit. Even before Bercow\\'s move May was by no means certain of getting her deal through parliament after it was decisively rejected in January and then again last week. Many of her Conservative MPs are still opposed to the text believing it keeps Britain too closely aligned to the EU. Several suggested that Bercow\\'s ruling means May must now return to the negotiating table even at this late stage. However Barclay warned: \"It is the only deal on the table from the EU -- the EU have been consistent on that. \"Either we back the prime minister\\'s deal and get Brexit over the\\xa0line or we risk either a softer Brexit or no Brexit at all.\" Bercow\\'s decision was based on a precedent dating back to 1604 that the same or \"substantially the same\" proposal cannot be put to MPs again in the same parliamentary session. He indicated that the changes necessary to bring the deal back for another vote would have to result from talks with the EU. \\'Major constitutional crisis\\' Constitutional experts suggested that if the EU agrees to an extension that might also constitute enough of a change to have a vote after the summit next week. If a majority of MPs swing behind May\\'s deal they could pass a motion to force Bercow to allow another vote. Solicitor General Robert Buckland has even suggested ending the parliamentary session early and starting another straight after. Buckland said Bercow had triggered a \"major constitutional crisis\". There is deep frustration at the latest setback in government where ministers have long questioned Bercow\\'s neutrality on Brexit. One government source accused him of trying to force a delay in which a new closer relationship with the EU could be agreed. \"There are ways around this\" Buckland said but added: \"We are talking about hours to March 29. Frankly we could have done without this.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The outcome of this will determine whether Brexit will be a hard one or not. Although the discussion about the possibility of whether a second referendum on Brexit will happen has been brought up by various stakeholders in recent months the idea has so far failed to gather the necessary momentum for it to be on the cards. This is primarily due to the fact that the two major political parties are not in favour or at least at this moment in time. In light of the constantly changing market environment and expectations surrounding a potential Brexit deal markets seem to have become pretty immune to this. This was particularly evident with the flat market reaction following an extraordinary summit in Brussels where European Union leaders signed off Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement. An interpretation to this could be that market sentiment has stabilised itself and whatever the outcome of the parliamentary vote the FTSE index is not likely to significantly outperform or underperform other global indices. As a matter of fact Japanese investment bank Nomura believes that the market is currently already pricing in the risk of a hard Brexit. This factor together with confirmation that all seven British banks and building societies in this year’s Bank of England (BOE) stress test passed indicating they could withstand a disorderly Brexit without having to curb lending goes to reassure Brexiteers’ thinking that the impending doom scenario is improbable and unrealistic. Indicators all seem to point towards the reluctance of UK politicians to believe that a no deal will have a catastrophic effect on the British economy as Theresa May does not seem to have the numbers to get the negotiated Brexit deal ratified by the House of Commons. Investors who firmly believe that whatever the outcome of the vote the UK economy will be more or less unaffected or will perhaps even thrive are currently adopting a neutral stance with the intention of entering the market with the next dip. Some analysts also believe that should Brexit uncertainty be removed soon the sterling could revisit this year’s high of $1.43. Other models recently developed such as that by Nomura bank predict that with a no deal the sterling could drop over eight per cent in value and touch the $1.18 price level from the current $1.28. Jane Foley the head of foreign exchange strategy at Rabobank also believes that the closer we get to the vote the greater the likelihood that pessimism will prevail and that investors will short the sterling in greater volumes. Most fund managers have so far been reluctant to go down this route due to the high level of uncertainty prevailing. They do believe that they could end up at the wrong side of the bet should the decision be contrary to what they are expecting. The UK economy will be more or less unaffected or will perhaps even thrive Alberto Gallo head of macro strategies at Algebris Investments – a London based asset management company has in fact confirmed that they do not have a position on the sterling at the time being. “It is very hard for people to hold a position in such a binary environment” he said. This ‘no action’ strategy contrasts with what is being projected by the government and the BOE alike. A government report issued this week projected a drop of 10.7 per cent in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the event of a hard Brexit over 15 years. The BOE went a step further by predicting a similar decline but in just over five years. This slump which could turn out to be the steepest one since World War II would send property prices crashing down by around 30 per cent and the sterling by approximately 25 per cent. This fall will be partly triggered by the shrinking supply of European Union workers. The negative effects on the British economy are not only likely to be triggered by a hard Brexit but also under Theresa May’s Brexit plan. As a matter of fact earlier on this week the oldest British independent economic research institute the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) published a report which states that after 10 years out of the European Union UK’s economy would be almost four per cent smaller than it would be if the country never exits. The NIESR assessment also goes into government borrowing and predicts that under Theresa May’s plan this would be 2.6 per cent higher than it is today while government revenue will be 1.5 per cent to two per cent in the long-run. Following yesterday’s first day of the G20 summit Theresa May has tried to convince world leaders and sceptical UK MP’s alike that the proposed Brexit deal – pending parliamentary approval on December 11 – is the way forward to mitigate the negative consequences of an otherwise hard Brexit scenario. She also intends to promote global trade albeit US President Donald Trump expressed his scepticism on Britain achieving a trade deal with his country. In his opinion Britain would still be significantly aligned with Brussels’ rules. Investors have warned that anyone hoping that financial markets will ride to the rescue of Theresa May’s Brexit deal is likely to be disappointed. All stakeholders seem to be of the view that Brexit will bring about negative effects at least in the short term but differences on the longer-term performance of the economy exist. Perhaps the uncertainty revolving around any Brexit scenario might instigate further the possibility of a second referendum taking place which could potentially reverse the financial market performance witnessed so far including the impact on the sterling. Panicked and rushed decisions are never a solution to investment market turbulence. The ideal way forward is for an investor to schedule a meeting with his financial advisor so that a risk profile is defined. Following this the principal options available are the following: retain the sterling investments and ride the waves; retain the sterling but invest in collective investment schemes that have an underlying exposure to global assets; switch investments to euro hedged securities which hold UK underlying assets; or sell the sterling or part thereof depending on the overall portfolio allocation. The next few days and weeks will surely keep investors searching for news on what could happen next.

The British government said Thursday that Brexit talks with the EU will focus on winning new guarantees to reassure eurosceptic MPs rather than on demanding the divorce deal be re-opened. One day after Prime Minister Theresa May met EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker her Brexit minister and attorney general were back in Brussels for talks with EU negotiators. Afterwards London said the \"simplest way\" to get a legally binding guarantee that \"Irish backstop\" clause in the deal is temporary would be to re-negotiate the accord. \"That remains the government\\'s position\" a spokesman for Brexit minister Stephen Barclay said. But EU leaders insist the withdrawal agreement which they struck with May at a summit last year can not now be re-opened even to appease British lawmakers. And London now appears to accept that this is a dead end and that the talks must move on to other avenues. \"The Prime Minister and President Juncker agreed that work would now focus on guarantees relating to the backstop that underline once again its temporary nature and give appropriate legal assurance to both sides as well as alternative arrangements and the political declaration to reach a mutually acceptable agreement\" the statement said. Brussels is open to adopting a more ambitious political declaration setting a road-map for negotiating close EU-UK trade ties during a transition period after Brexit on March 29. Backbench hardliners May hopes that if she can demonstrate that the backstop - which would bind Britain into the EU customs union until a deal is reached to keep the Irish border open - is temporary then anti-European MPs will ratify the deal. But European leaders remain sceptical that a fragmenting House of Commons will ever deliver a majority in favour of the deal and the EU expects London to ask for a Brexit delay. One way May could build a majority is by convincing opposition Labour members to back a deal rejected by many Conservative eurosceptics. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was also in Brussels on Thursday. Corbyn said he had \"useful informative and very frank\" conversations with EU negotiator Michel Barnier and other EU officials and warned that May\\'s dependence on backbench hardliners was driving Brexit to the brink. He outlined his proposal that Britain should enter a customs union with the bloc when it leaves -- an idea unacceptable to many Brexit supporters who say it would tie London\\'s hands on trade deals. \"The danger of no deal exit from the EU for Britain is a very serous and present one\" Corbyn told reporters afterwards urging May to soften her stance which he said was being driven by her Conservative Party\\'s pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) of MPs. \"She is allowing herself to be held to ransom by a small group in her party called the ERG and that is some of the problem. She has got to change her ways otherwise the danger of a no deal exit with all the chaos that would cause is a very real possibility\" he warned. While Corbyn was in Brussels British finance minister Philip Hammond raised hopes of a breakthrough in the coming days telling the BBC there had been \"some movement\" by the European Union. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

European Union and British negotiators conceded Wednesday that talks aimed at getting their Brexit agreement through parliament in London have been \"difficult\" as a solution remained elusive three weeks before Britain\\'s exit. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier reported the continued deadlock to the European Commission the EU\\'s executive arm after meeting his British counterparts late Tuesday. Barnier informed the commissioners that \"while the talks take place in a constructive atmosphere discussions have been difficult\" spokesman Margaritis Schinas said. Barnier added that \"no solution has been identified at this point that is consistent with the withdrawal agreement\" Schinas told a press conference. Prime Minister Theresa May struck the withdrawal deal with the EU in November but the British parliament overwhelmingly voted it down in January. MPs continue to challenge the agreement especially the \"backstop\" designed to keep the border open between EU-member Ireland and British Northern Ireland after Brexit. Barnier said the backstop was the sticking point after meeting with UK Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Brexit minister Stephen Barclay over dinner in the Belgian capital on Tuesday. May\\'s spokesman said Wednesday in London: \"My understanding is that the talks were difficult and that there was a robust exchange of views.\" The spokesman added Britain will \"continue to pursue\" parliament\\'s demand for legally binding changes to ensure \"the UK won\\'t be trapped in the backstop indefinitely.\" The EU sees the provision as vital to preserving the peace process in Northern Ireland but London fears it will tie Britain indefinitely to an EU customs union. Cox the British government\\'s top lawyer told Sky News television he had put forward some \"very reasonable proposals\" during his talks. \\'Meat of the matter\\' \"We\\'re into the meat of the matter now\" the top lawyer added without revealing the content of the discussions. He promised negotiations would resume soon while May\\'s spokesman said technical talks were ongoing. Cox\\'s presence is seen as central as he will ultimately offer a legal opinion on the Brexit deal and the Irish backstop that could determine whether key pro-Brexit lawmakers will approve the withdrawal agreement. Earlier advice by Cox warning that the backstop could keep Britain tied permanently to an EU customs union was viewed as a contributing factor in the massive defeat of May\\'s deal by MPs in January. Barnier insisted anew Wednesday that the legally binding withdrawal agreement will not be reopened. The EU says the talks in Brussels are focused on drafting a separate document to placate doubters in London. But most of them continue to press for a time limit or exit clause to the backstop. They have also set up their own team of lawyers to scrutinise anything that Cox brings back from Brussels. In 2017 Britain invoked Article 50 of EU law triggering a two-year countdown to Brexit that ends at 11pm (2300 GMT) on March 29. Both sides are furiously trying to steer away from a dreaded \"no-deal\" divorce that could wreak havoc on global markets and create border chaos. The OECD on Wednesday chopped Britain\\'s growth forecast from 1.4 to 0.8% which would mark the first time it had fallen below one percent since 2009 following the global economic crisis. However the OECD emphasised that even this stark projection was based on the assumption of a smooth Brexit. The House of Commons will have another chance to vote on the deal next Tuesday. If MPs again reject it they will vote in the following days on whether to leave with no deal or delay Brexit. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

While Brussels choreographs the first withdrawal of a sovereign state from the EU May a far from secure leader hemmed in by opponents in government and her own Conservative party must now try to get the deal approved by her cabinet and in the toughest test of all by parliament. Brexiteers in May\\'s party accused her of surrendering to the EU and said they would vote the deal down while the Northern Irish party which props up her minority government questioned whether she would be able to get parliamentary approval. \"The trick will be for Theresa May can she satisfy everyone?\" said Nigel Dodds the deputy leader of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which keeps her government in power. \"It is going to be a very very hard sell I would have thought but let\\'s wait and see the actual detail\" Dodds said. The British cabinet will meet at 1400 GMT on Wednesday to consider the draft withdrawal agreement a Downing Street spokesman said after Irish and British media were leaked details of the agreement on the text. Sterling which has seesawed since reaching $1.50 just before Britain\\'s 2016 referendum that saw a 52-48 percent margin for leaving the EU surged on news of a deal but then erased some gains as opponents lined up to criticise May. Brexit will pitch the world\\'s fifth largest economy into the unknown and many fear it will serve to divide the West as it grapples with both the unconventional presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China. Supporters of Brexit say that while the divorce might bring some short-term instability in the longer term it will allow the United Kingdom to thrive and also enable deeper EU integration without such a powerful reluctant member. A senior EU official confirmed that a draft text had been agreed. EU leaders could meet on Nov. 25 for a summit to seal the Brexit deal if May\\'s cabinet approves the text diplomatic sources said. The EU and Britain need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the world\\'s biggest trading bloc and the United Kingdom home to the biggest international financial centre. But May an initial opponent of Brexit who won the top job in the turmoil that followed the referendum has struggled to untangle nearly 46 years of EU membership without damaging commerce or upsetting the lawmakers who will ultimately decide the fate of the divorce accord. By seeking to leave the EU while preserving the closest possible ties May\\'s compromise plan has upset Brexiteers pro-Europeans Scottish nationalists the Northern Irish party that props up her government and some of her own ministers. It is unclear when parliament might vote on a deal. To get the deal approved she needs the votes of about 320 lawmakers in the 650-seat parliament. She faces a deeply divided government party parliament and country. Prominent Brexiteers such as Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said May had sold out the United Kingdom and that they would oppose it. \"It is a failure of the government\\'s negotiating position it is a failure to deliver on Brexit and it is potentially dividing up the United Kingdom\" Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg said. The opposition Labour Party which has said it would oppose any agreement that does not retain \"the exact same\" economic benefits that it now has with the EU said it was unlikely the announced deal was right for Britain. \"It is vassal state stuff\" Johnson said adding that he would vote against such an unacceptable accord. \"Chuck it out.\" Johnson\\'s brother Jo a pro-European resigned from May\\'s government on Friday calling for another referendum to avoid her Brexit plans unleashing Britain’s greatest crisis since World War Two. May formally began Britain’s divorce in March 2017 ushering in tortuous negotiations on everything from space exploration and fishing territories to selling complex financial products and the future of the land border on the island of Ireland. As deadlines passed officials such as Britain\\'s Olly Robbins and the Commission\\'s Sabine Weyand a German raced to get a deal in late night sessions at the European Commission\\'s modernist Berlaymont building in Brussels. With less than five months until Britain leaves the EU the so-called Northern Irish backstop was the main sticking point. The backstop is an insurance policy to avoid a return to controls on the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member state Ireland if a future trading relationship is not agreed in time. The British government supplied no immediate details on the Brexit deal text which runs to hundreds of pages. Three EU sources said the backstop would come in the form of a UK-wide customs arrangement with specific provisions for Northern Ireland which go deeper on the issue of customs and alignment with the rules of the EU single market than for the rest of the United Kingdom. It would include a review mechanism to bridge between EU demands that the insurance policy is permanently available and Britain\\'s request to avoid being held in a customs alliance with the bloc perpetually. The Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have ruled out any deal that treats Northern Ireland differently. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Updated at 1.02pm British Prime Minister Theresa May faces crushing defeat in a historic vote in parliament on Tuesday over the Brexit deal she has struck with the European Union leaving the world\\'s fifth biggest economy in limbo. With just over two months to go until the scheduled Brexit date of March 29 Britain is still bitterly divided over what should happen next and the only suspense over the vote is the scale of May\\'s defeat. The British leader\\'s last-minute appeals to MPs appear to have fallen on deaf ears and how much she loses by could determine whether she tries again loses office delays Brexit - or if Britain even leaves the EU at all. \"When the history books are written people will look at the decision of this house... and ask: did we deliver on the country\\'s vote to leave the European Union\" May asked MPs on the eve of the vote expected from around 1900 GMT. A German government spokesman on Tuesday denied a report in The Sun tabloid that German Chancellor Angela Merkel had suggested to May in a phone-call that the EU could grant extra concessions in the event of a defeat. \"The chancellor has given no assurances\" he said. \\'No Deal? No problem!\\' Opposition to the deal forced May to postpone the vote in December in the hope of winning extra concessions from Brussels but EU leaders offered only a series of clarifications and have ruled out re-negotiating the deal. The vote is the climax of over two years of intense national debate after the shock Brexit referendum of 2016 - a result that mostly pro-Remain MPs have struggled with. Hardline Brexiteers and Remainers oppose the agreement for different reasons and many fear it could lock Britain into an unfavourable trading relationship with the EU. Pro- and anti-Brexit campaigners rallied outside parliament ahead of the vote. One placard read \"EU Membership is the Best Deal\" another said: \"No Deal? No Problem!\" Uncertainty over Brexit has hit the British economy hard. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) lobby group on Tuesday warned MPs that Britain crashing out of the EU would be \"catastrophic\". Financial markets will also be watching the result very closely with several currency traders roping in extra staff around the time of the vote and at least one putting a cap in trades to avoid excessive currency movements. Frustration Rather than heal the divisions exposed by the Brexit referendum the vote has reignited them. Pro-European MPs campaigning to force a second vote say they have faced death threats and harassment outside parliament. Brexit supporters around the country have also voiced growing frustration with what they see as parliamentary blockage of their democratic vote. Criticism is focused on an arrangement to keep open the border with Ireland by aligning Britain with some EU trade rules if and until London and Brussels sign a new economic partnership which could take several years. May has offered parliament greater oversight of this so-called backstop and EU leaders have also given written assurances that the arrangement would not become permanent. A handful of Conservative MPs have changed their minds to back the deal but the core of May\\'s critics say she has not done enough. Sammy Wilson Brexit spokesman with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) the Northern Irish party on whom May relies for her Commons majority told the BBC his party would not be forced into backing the deal by fears over the border. \"We fought (against) a terrorist campaign (in order) to stay part of the United Kingdom\" he said evoking Northern Ireland\\'s past conflict. \"We are not going to allow bureaucrats in Brussels to separate us from the rest of the United Kingdom.\" Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said May had \"completely and utterly failed\" to ease MPs\\' concerns and said if she loses the vote on Tuesday night she must call an election. His party has said it will call a confidence vote in her government \"soon\" after the virtually certain defeat. Risk of no deal In the event of a defeat the government must set out what happens next by Monday at the latest. Speculation is growing on both sides of the Channel that whatever the outcome May could ask to delay Brexit. A diplomatic source told AFP any extension would not be possible beyond June 30 when the new European Parliament will be formed. The withdrawal agreement includes plans for a post-Brexit transition period to provide continuity until a new relationship is drawn up in return for continued budget contributions from London. Without it and if there is no delay Britain will sever 46 years of ties with its nearest neighbours this spring with no new arrangements to ease the blow. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Updated Britain and the EU agreed Thursday to hold more talks to try to avoid a no-deal Brexit after a \"robust\" meeting between Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. A joint statement issued after the talks in Brussels said Juncker had again warned that November\\'s withdrawal agreement could not be renegotiated - after May came hoping to persuade Brussels to change the so-called \"backstop\" clause for the Irish border. But Juncker expressed only his \"openness to add wording\" to a parallel political declaration laying out ambitions for future EU-UK ties if London wants to seek a \"more ambitious\" closer relationship after Brexit. After his own talks with May EU President Donald Tusk warned there was \"no breakthrough in sight\" though the British leader said she had seen willingness from Brussels to find a deal. \"Prime Minister May did not offer any new concrete proposals on the way forward\" an EU official told AFP after May\\'s meeting with Tusk. Talk has been growing that Britain may have to delay Brexit to give enough time to get the necessary legislation through parliament but May vowed once again to bring Britain out of the bloc on schedule on March 29. \"I\\'m going to deliver Brexit I\\'m going to deliver it on time. That\\'s what I\\'m going to do for the British public. I\\'ll be negotiating hard in the coming days to do just that\" she said. The EU official said Tusk had asked May about the timeline for British officials and parliament to ratify and implement a deal but received \"no clear answers.\" And Tusk also the official said suggested to May that she study a Brexit plan laid out earlier in the day by British opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn which \"might be a promising way out of the impasse.\" May did not respond. Legally-binding changes In a sharp reminder of the urgency of finding a solution before Brexit day Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that Britain\\'s economy was \"not yet prepared\" for a no-deal departure. May said she had spelled out to Juncker and Tusk Britain\\'s \"clear position\" that legally-binding changes are needed to the backstop to win round MPs fearful it could be used to \"trap\" Britain in the bloc against its will. Such changes were not forthcoming but instead she got a fresh round of talks. EU negotiator Michel Barnier will now meet British Brexit Minister Stephen Barclay in Strasbourg on Monday but an EU official described these as \"exploratory talks\" adding: \"There is no mandate to negotiate.\" May herself will meet Juncker again before the end of February a commission spokesman said. Expectations for Thursday\\'s visit were already modest when a day earlier Tusk and Juncker torched May\\'s prospects of winning changes to the withdrawal agreement. Juncker told reporters May knows and accepts the Union will not reopen talks on the deal while Tusk who represents EU member governments as head of the European Council triggered outrage across the Channel by damning pro-Brexit politicians for - in his view - recklessly failing to plan. \"I\\'ve been wondering what that special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely\" Tusk said. May said she had raised the incendiary remarks with Tusk calling them \"not helpful\" and saying they had caused \"widespread dismay\" in Britain. \\'Don\\'t gamble with peace\\' Ahead of the trip Number 10 said that because the British parliament rejected the deal May must seek material changes to the accord or see it fail. The impasse in Brussels has deepened fears that Britain could crash out of the EU without a deal on March 29 disrupting trade and supplies to manufacturing. May has exasperated EU leaders by repeatedly coming to Brussels without detailed proposals to solve the Brexit deadlock and Tusk warned her he expected her to bring \"a realistic suggestion on how to end the impasse\". Corbyn the leader of the main opposition Labour party wrote to May on Thursday setting out his five conditions for backing her on Brexit - including the UK staying in the EU\\'s customs union. While his demands will not be palatable to many in May\\'s Conservative party - not least because of the deeply-entrenched tribalism of British politics - it suggests there may be room for manoeuvre if not yet a clear path to a cross-party deal. The EU official told AFP that Brussels has not had long to study Corbyn\\'s plan but that Tusk had recommended May look it over. May will have dinner with her Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar in Dublin on Friday. Painstaking talks Varadkar whose government has stressed the importance of maintaining an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit said recent \"instability in British politics\" showed why a backstop was essential. Last month the House of Commons overwhelmingly rejected the Brexit deal that May had negotiated with the EU after 18 months of painstaking diplomacy. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

She speaks to three women whose future in the UK is now full of uncertainty wrapped up in lots of red tape.\\xa0 Britain’s vote to leave the EU has massive implications not just for Britons but for the estimated 28000 Maltese citizens who have been living happily in the UK for years. Dr Kathrina Farrugia-Kriel Marie Claire Saliba and Francesca Falzon are three of those. \"Many of my colleagues were very upset.\" : Kathrina Farrugia-Kriel. Kathrina is a senior lecturer in dance studies at the Royal Academy of Dance – she is married and is expecting a baby in November. Francesca is a project manager at a management consultancy firm in central London and is in a long-term relationship. Marie Claire has just moved to the UK to be with her British fiancé. All were dismayed by the Brexit vote and are working to understand why it happened and what it means for them. “It came as a complete shock to me and my friends and colleagues living in London. I think the ‘Stay’ campaign was weak and failed to highlight the benefits of the EU while the ‘Leave’ campaign based their arguments on lies and appealed to the emotions of the ignorant. However I think we cannot simply blame the campaigns as the vote reflected an increase in discontent among the British with foreigners” Francesca says. “Brexit can be compared to a voice for ‘liberation’ from a culture of migration. It was driven by the notion of independence and a restoration of cultural identity” Kathrina says. She felt that pro-Brexit leaders “capitalised on groups of people who were disillusioned with immigration cultural diversity and… the economy… EU migrants have been criticised for taking the jobs of locals”. This sentiment is misplaced she feels pointing out that “as an economic migrant I have contributed as much as my UK-born colleagues”. \\xa0 What Will Brexit Bring? The women have different concerns about the possible outcomes of Brexit. Working in a university Kathrina is concerned about the mentality behind the vote and its implications for society. \"Brexit certainly adds an element of uncertainty to my future in London\" says Francesca Falzon. Photo: Mark Soler “Within the higher education context it is important to retain cultural diversity” so that students and staff can experience “a mixture of perspectives on the world. Higher education thrives on bringing the best thinkers to the academic community whether they are Italian Maltese French or Belgian.” Francesca is more worried about the economic fallout. “Sterling fell 10 per cent house sales in London have collapsed and business sentiment is low” she says. Kathrina has a particularly interesting take on life as a Maltese in Britain because she took up her graduate teaching assistantship that led to her current career in 2004 the year that Malta joined the EU. It’s a moment she describes as “pivotal” saying “prior to that Maltese citizens had to apply for student or two-year working holiday visas in order to study or gain employment. Both had restrictions and limited our opportunities. Indeed if Malta hadn’t entered the EU in 2004 I was told my graduate teaching assistantship at the University of Surrey would not have materialised”. All three feel that being in the EU is also a good thing for women. “I think the EU has helped broaden the horizons of people towards women in society which has led to better opportunities” Francesca says. For her the EU brings basic fairness: “The idea is that we have a level playing field across countries and that we avoid a ‘race to the bottom’ where countries use the excuse of competitiveness to forsake basic standards in the workplace and quality of life.” “At a glance maternity leave and family leave are miles better in the UK [than in Malta]” Marie Claire adds. \\xa0 Little Britain While neither Francesca nor Kathrina have experienced xenophobia personally either before or after the Brexit vote Kathrina has occasionally seen the racist underbelly of Britain exposed. \"We have somewhere else to go if we want to leave. The Brits don’t!”notes Marie Claire Saliba. “There have been episodes of racially motivated acts of protest in South East England. I have heard of cards being posted in letterboxes saying particular communities should go back to their homeland and seen TV footage of demonstrations that voice anti-immigration movements” she says. “Many of my colleagues at work were very upset with the Brexit outcome. It has made sections of communities become closer” she adds. What has been even more disruptive for her however has been the political turmoil in Westminster. “In view of new leadership in Parliament we continue with our usual routine until we have any further updates including on when Article 50 will be activated whether long-term or recently migrated EU citizens will have their status altered and how the economy will evolve. In the meantime we can talk about the weather and enjoy a cup of tea” Kathrina says. Marie Claire is appalled by hate crimes that have come in the wake of Brexit. “The worst in my opinion was vandalism at a school with a large Polish population. What kind of people threaten children?” She adds: “My non-British colleagues are somewhat concerned while one British colleague found herself wondering if she looked British enough to avoid harassment on the street. “I have not been harassed… However… it is always made clear that I’m not from here I’m foreign and will always be.” \\xa0 Back to Fear for the Future When asked about their hopes and fears for the future Kathrina says she hopes that Brexit will bring the communities in the UK together to closely consider the human lives that construct and sustain the economy. “Lives matter whatever creed culture or language we speak. We all have a duty of care.” Professionally she says her concerns are “largely driven by the potential loss of research funding a decline in student diversity and a loss of EU academics in the post-Brexit period. “I hope the Brexit negotiations will allow for some remnants of connections to the EU to remain and that residency rights will be offered to long-standing contributors to the economy” she adds. Francesca hopes that the Sterling strengthens. “Brexit certainly adds an element of uncertainty to my future in London” she points out. Marie Claire’s hope is that “the UK and EU economies will recover from the blow and that human kindness will outweigh the nastiness that has surfaced. Brexit for me means more red tape to live and work in the UK alongside my British fiancé and a whole host of uncertainty”. None of the women plan on returning to Malta immediately although Francesca adds that it depends on the outcome of the negotiations. With Theresa May now at the helm as Britain’s second woman Prime Minister perhaps a pragmatic female approach will help those negotiations succeed. If not Marie Claire sums up the consequence of Brexit most succinctly saying: “I suppose it makes me a bit more likely to return at some point if living and working [in the UK] becomes too full of red tape and xenophobia.\\xa0But we’re lucky that way aren’t we? We have somewhere else to go if we want to leave.

Photo: Reuters  The boss of London’s Heathrow welcomed the government’s recent emphasis on protecting business in Brexit talks as Europe’s biggest airport reported record passenger numbers yesterday. Heathrow is Britain’s biggest trade port handling a quarter of its goods exports by value and John Holland-Kaye chief executive of Heathrow Airport Holdings said yesterday Britain needs to rebalance its economy to other parts of the UK and boost exports if it is to prosper outside the EU. “I’m encouraged by the language the government’s been using increasingly focusing on the needs of business” he told Reuters after the company reported first half results. Prime Minister Theresa May has recently moved to ease concerns over Brexit among British businesses meeting industry chiefs last week and signalling she wanted a “smooth orderly exit” from the EU including “a period of implementation in order to avoid any cliff edges”. “We welcome what we’re hearing from the government about growing the economy faster than before and making sure Britain keeps its position as a leading trading nation. That’s exactly the right sort of thing to be doing” Holland-Kaye said. Heathrow said it drew a record 37.1 million passengers in the first half of this year up 3.9 per cent on a year ago. That helped push its revenues up 4.1 per cent to £1.4 billion while underlying earnings rose nearly seven per cent. The UK sees Heathrow as a vital element of the country’s post-Brexit future and has pledged to expand the airport. Holland-Kaye said the Brexit vote had focused minds on a new runway at Heathrow which was announced last October after 25 years of indecision. “There’s a growing sense that it’s really essential in a Brexit world that we get on and make Britain as competitive as we can make it and Heathrow as the trading hub is key to that” he said. Heathrow sought to reassure that it can keep costs down as it expands. The airport operator said it was making good progress towards meeting the government’s challenge to deliver expansion while keeping airport charges close to where they are. Holland-Kaye said that costs would be kept down by simplifying the terminal structure through a possible expansion of terminals 2 and 5 rather than by seeking a shorter runway. “We want to be able to have a full-length runway which will allow any plane to land and take off” he said. “That means that we can protect the long-term future of the UK economy.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s Brexit transition deal last month has boosted confidence among finance chiefs at some of the country\\'s leading companies a survey published on Monday showed. Accountancy firm Deloitte said 27 per cent of chief financial officers it interviewed after the deal was struck were more optimistic than three months earlier. That compared with 18 per cent of CFOs who were more optimistic before the deal was struck. Prime Minister Theresa May and the rest of the EU\\'s leaders agreed on March 19 to keep their existing trade ties unchanged for 21 months after Brexit in March 2019. The deal pushed back the risk of disruption for companies until the end of 2020 although for the transition agreement to become effective London and Brussels must first agree on their long-term trade ties for the period after 2020. Deloitte interviewed 106 CFOs from large British firms and major British subsidiaries of foreign companies between March 7 and March 21. About four-fifths of them responded before the transition deal was reached. Risk appetite strengthened after the deal with 23 per cent of those responding after the deal was done saying it was a good time to take on risk up from 12 per cent beforehand. The survey also showed corporate uncertainty was at a two-year low although almost one in three CFOs said their firms still faced high or very high levels of uncertainty. Britain\\'s economy has slowed since the 2016 referendum decision to leave the EU due in part to weaker growth in investment spending by companies. \"Brexit remains a major concern for UK CFOs though one which in the wake of the announcement of the transition deal is easing\" David Sproul chief executive of Deloitte North West Europe said. \"Concerns about the dampening effect on corporate spending plans remain but they have softened.\" Deloitte said for the first time in two years Brexit was not the top risk for CFOs being replaced by weak domestic demand. However much of that weakness in demand reflects the impact that the Brexit vote has had on spending by British households who have faced higher inflation caused by the fall in the value of sterling. Sproul said business confidence would depend on progress in talks about Britain\\'s new long-term trade ties to the EU. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s banks could deal with a hard Brexit next March if need be Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Wednesday rejecting European Union warnings that lenders are inadequately prepared. The BoE\\'s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) said banks in Britain are holding enough capital and will not need any more to face any turbulence in markets if Britain leaves the EU next March without a deal. On Monday the European Union\\'s banking watchdog the European Banking Authority (EBA) said banks had failed to make enough progress in their Brexit preparations and should not expect help from \"miracle\" public intervention. \"With respect the EBA\\'s comments earlier this week were incomplete\" Carney said in a news conference. \"They did not acknowledge the temporary permissions regime ... which has been very clearly signalled by the UK government.\" Carney said British authorities\\' preparation of banks for Brexit had been \"rock solid\" and that the BoE continued to judge that the UK banking system could support the real economy through a disorderly Brexit. The FPC said capital levels at banks were now high enough that it would leave unchanged their so-called counter cyclical capital buffer or CCYB at 1 per cent binding from the end of November. The committee had said in March it would review this month whether the buffer should be raised due to other risks that build up over the course of a credit cycle. These include mortgages granted at high loan-to-income ratios that bump up against the BoE\\'s ceiling and unsecured consumer lending. This buffer aims to ensure that banks build up capital to guard against risks as the credit cycle picks up which they can then draw on during a downturn. It applies on top of other internationally-required buffers. The FPC said on Wednesday that consumer credit continues to expand rapidly but measures already taken to stop overheating were already having an impact with banks reporting a significant tightening of unsecured credit. The FPC said Britain has made good progress in ensuring that outstanding derivatives contracts do not pose a risk to the British economy if there is no Brexit transition deal in place by next March. The FPC also said it will launch in 2019 its first pilot stress test to check on the ability of a select number of lenders to withstand a cyber attack. Risks from the global economy remained material and have increased the BoE said noting that trade tensions have intensified. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A row over how much say Britain\\'s parliament should have over the Brexit process is set to reach its conclusion on Wednesday as lawmakers finalise the wording of the laws that will end the country\\'s membership of the European Union next year. After more than 250 hours of debate one major issue remains. Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s government has promised to give parliament a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal it negotiates with Brussels but what does that actually mean? On the table are two similar technical definitions of what that promise means: one proposed by the government and one proposed by a pro-EU member of May\\'s Conservative Party Dominic Grieve. Parliament will decide which version to approve later on Wednesday in what is expected to be a very tight vote. The vote would be politically damaging for May to lose and could make a \\'no deal\\' Brexit less likely. Below is a summary of what is agreed and where differences remain. Agreed - Once the government has agreed a Brexit deal with the EU it will present that deal in parliament and allow lawmakers to approve or reject it. - If that deal is rejected by parliament or if the government decides no deal is possible or if a deal has not been reached by Jan. 21 2019 the government has to come up with a new plan of action and present it to parliament. Not agreed - The government says parliament should be allowed to debate the plan on next steps but not to amend the plan. They argue this would bind the government\\'s hands in negotiations which May and her team say is unacceptable. - The rival amendment says parliament should be able to debate the plan on next steps and amend it if necessary. Its backers argue that this would not bind the government\\'s hands and is necessary to make the vote on the final Brexit deal truly meaningful. Why does it matter? The real power of the rebel amendment is political. It paves the way for lawmakers to explicitly endorse an alternative to May\\'s plan. If parliament does that it would be hugely damaging for May and make it very difficult for an already weakened leader to follow through with her long-standing promise to leave the EU without an agreed exit deal unless Brussels agrees to a \"good deal\". Anything that decreases the probability of a \\'no deal\\' scenario will be welcomed by most businesses who fear the disruption of an unmanaged and abrupt exit. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British leader Theresa May\\'s government warned Sunday it might not have a planned Brexit vote this week unless it feels it could secure a win that avoids a lengthy delay to the EU pullout. Britain has been paralysed by political inaction and chaos as it barrels toward the March 29 end of its 46-year involvement in the bloc without a plan. Parliament has twice resoundingly rejected the separation terms May reached with the other 27 EU leaders last year. She doggedly vowed to bring the lawmakers back by Wednesday for a third vote that -- if it finally ended in success -- would see her ask the EU for a \"technical\" Brexit delay until June. But May warned on Sunday that another defeat would almost certainly require Britain to take part in European Parliament elections in May. This would mean \"we will not leave the EU for many months if ever\" May wrote in The Sunday Telegraph\". Two of her top ministers then warned that May might not even submit her deal for a third vote unless she feels she has sufficient support from her own party members who previously voted against. \"It would be difficult to justify having a vote if you knew you were going to lose it\" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told Sky News. \"We will only bring the deal back if we are confident that enough of our colleagues... are prepared to support it so that we can get it through parliament\" finance minister Philip Hammond added on the BBC. \"I mean we are not just going to keep presenting it if we haven\\'t moved the dial\" Hammond said. Some EU leaders have suggested postponing Brexit until the end of 2020. A delay that long could give Britain time to decide to either keep much closer EU ties or have Brexit reversed in a new national poll -- two options welcomed by a range of European officials. The 27 EU leaders will meet in Brussels on Thursday and Friday to discuss their Brexit options. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The legal risk of Britain being stuck in EU trade arrangements after Brexit fundamentally \"remains unchanged\" the UK government\\'s chief legal advisor said Tuesday. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said last-minute new agreements \"reduce the risk\" of Britain being \"indefinitely and involuntarily\" held in the so-called Irish border backstop. However \"the legal risk remains unchanged\" that Britain without being able to prove bad faith on behalf of the European Union would have no legal means of exiting the backstop without the agreement of Brussels. Prime Minister Theresa May rushed to Strasbourg on Monday for last-minute talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in a bid to salvage the Brexit deal with British MPs set to vote Tuesday on whether to accept the withdrawal agreement. The two sides then announced a three-part package of legally-binding changes to the old deal. The backstop designed to keep the land border between the UK and Ireland free-flowing after Brexit would see Britain stick to EU trade arrangements unless a new trade deal is struck. Britain could not unilaterally pull out - something that caused Brexit-backing MPs to vote down the deal in January. Legal advice Cox gave his legal opinion on the new wording struck between May and Juncker -- which could be crucial in determining how Brexiteers vote later Tuesday. Cox said he now considered that the legally-binding provisions of the new documents \"reduce the risk that the United Kingdom could be indefinitely and involuntarily detained\" within the backstop \"at least in so far as that situation had been brought about by the bad faith or want of best endeavours of the EU\". He said that if both parties were indeed sincere in their desire to reach an agreement it was \"highly unlikely\" that a subsequent agreement that would avoid the backstop kicking in would not be concluded. Cox said that was a \"political judgement\" but one he strongly thought was right to make. But in the final part of his conclusion Cox said that legal risks of Britain being stuck in the backstop remained. \"The legal risk remains unchanged that if through no such demonstrable failure of either party but simply because of intractable differences that situation does arise the United Kingdom would have at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same no internationally lawful means of exiting the protocol\\'s arrangements save by agreement\" he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Speaking after the European Commission sat in Strasbourg deputy head Frans Timmermans said a Brexit deal with Britain was the bloc\\'s preferred solution. \"Very intense negotiations are ongoing. It is clear that although we are making progress we are not there yet\" he told a news conference. \"We also discussed a number of issues related to our no-deal planning. You have to do that anyway. We are working very hard for a deal and let\\'s be clear that is by far our preferred option. But we need to prepare for all options.\" The Commission said Britons would need no visas for stays of up to 90 days. \"In the scenario where the UK leaves the EU without a deal this would apply as of 30 March 2019. If a deal is reached however it would apply as of the end of the transition period\" the Commission said in a statement. \"This proposal is entirely conditional upon the UK also granting reciprocal and non-discriminatory visa-free travel for all EU member states in line with the principle of visa reciprocity\" it added. This would need to be approved by the European Parliament and EU member states to take effect. Read: Boris Johnson says Brexit deal would make UK an EU\\xa0colony Timmermans spoke after EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier updated the European Commission on divorce negotiations with Britain which British Prime Minister Theresa May said were \"in the endgame\" but remain stuck over the Irish border. EU diplomats did not have high hopes for a breakthrough this week that would allow for a summit of national leaders to rubber-stamp a Brexit deal this month. While a deal is possible in December delays raise the risk of the most damaging scenario of Britain leaving the EU next March without agreements in place to mitigate its impacts. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

European Union leaders gather for their December meeting on Thursday afternoon with the focus being on Brexit\\xa0and the EU Budget. The meeting had initially been set to be\\xa0the first post-Brexit agreement summit but the British government on Tuesday postponed the ratification of the Brexit\\xa0deal and British Prime Minister Theresa May is hoping to get new assurances in an effort to push the deal through the Commons in January. Several EU\\xa0leaders have said the legal text of the deal will not be changed but they are prepared to discuss clarifications and assurances. Mrs May is due to hold talks with the Irish prime minister and the president of the European Commission before the EU\\xa0leaders' summit formally gets under way. Regarding Brexit Prime Minister Joseph Muscat insisted earlier this week that there was no room for a better Brexit deal. “There is no room for further negotiation though perhaps there may be space to clarify certain points” he said during a cabinet meeting. With the March 2019 deadline for the UK to leave the EU looming EU\\xa0Council President Donald Tusk is also urging heads of government to discuss the state of preparations for a no-deal scenario. Budget talks The summit could be especially important for Malta as it seeks a bigger slice of cohesion funds during the talks on the EU Budget for 2021 - 2027. Britain's\\xa0withdrawal from the EU\\xa0means a smaller EU\\xa0budget the UK being one of the\\xa0bloc's biggest contributors to date. Malta's strong economic performance has also made it less eligible for cohesion funds. In a speech last month however Dr Muscat expressed optimism that Malta would continue to be eligible for some EU Cohesion Funds. He insisted that economic progress needed to be sustained rather than have support withdrawn and he was confident that this view was gaining traction in the European Commission. Times of Malta had reported in May how Malta’s economic boom was set to make the country one of the European Union’s biggest cohesion fund losers under budget plans unveiled by the European Commission. According to the plans Malta would receive roughly €673 million in cohesion funds between 2021 to 2027 – though that proposed figure was in reality closer to €597 million when funding was locked in at 2018 prices without inflation factored in.\\xa0 The EU\\xa0summit is also expected to discuss\\xa0migration and relations with the League of Arab States.\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British stocks jumped yesterday and the pound was firmer before fresh crunch votes on Prime Minister Theresa May’s revised Brexit deal. London’s benchmark FTSE 100 index was 1.3 per cent higher in mid-afternoon deals. Among eurozone heavyweights Frankfurt and Paris also rose on the back of growing optimism over the US-China trade dispute. Wall Street was a touch higher just after the opening bell. Oil prices rebounded gently having tumbled the previous day on worries over a slowing global economy and political instability in key producer Venezuela. As British lawmakers prepared to hold a series of votes that could reset the course of Brexit the pound held recently won ground against the dollar. MPs were set to vote yesterday evening on measures that could include preventing a no-deal Brexit delaying Brexit changing the negotiated deal − and even seizing control of the entire process. “The FTSE 100 is gaining ground... with markets looking relatively optimistic about today’s parliamentary votes” said IG analyst Joshua Mahony. Sterling has enjoyed healthy buying in recent weeks on expectations that a chaotic no-deal exit will be avoided. “Given the EU’s intransigence the probability of a referendum or an election remains high and will likely feed European asset volatility over the coming weeks” said Franklin Pichard director-general at Kiplink Finance. Aside from Brexit the main focus is a two-day meeting between China and US officials aimed at resolving the long-running trade war which has been a drag on equities. US President Donald Trump will meet China’s top economic envoy Liu He during the talks which start today while US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he expected “significant progress at these meetings”. In Asia earlier stock markets mostly fell as the charging of Chinese giant Huawei in the US cast a shadow over the upcoming trade talks. Beijing meanwhile is struggling to kickstart the world’s number two economy which expanded last year at its slowest pace for almost three decades. A mammoth debt mountain and the US trade war is hampering its efforts. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The British Prime Minister on Sunday warned MPs preparing to vote down her EU divorce deal that failing to deliver Brexit would be a \"catastrophic and unforgivable breach of trust in our democracy\".  British Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday warned MPs preparing to vote down her EU divorce deal that failing to deliver Brexit would be a \"catastrophic and unforgivable breach of trust in our democracy\". May who is fighting to save her withdrawal agreement negotiated with the bloc over 18 months of talks told lawmakers they must not let down Brexit-backers in a crunch parliamentary vote Tuesday. \"Doing so would be a catastrophic and unforgivable breach of trust in our democracy\" May wrote in the Sunday Express. \"So my message to parliament this weekend is simple: it is time to forget the games and do what is right for our country.\" Britain is set to leave the European Union on March 29 but has yet to finalise the terms of its departure. The prime minister has already postponed a House of Commons vote on her plan once -- in December -- to avoid defeat and looks certain to see it rejected by MPs on Tuesday amid fierce opposition. Lawmakers fired ominous warning shots this week voting to force May to quickly set out an alternative plan for Brexit if it is beaten. It was the second setback in 24 hours for the prime minister after MPs also voted to deny the government certain taxation powers in a no-deal scenario -- an attempt to scupper that prospect. The Sunday Times reported a group of senior cross-party backbench rebels are now plotting to change House of Commons rules to enable them to override government business if the deal falls. Described as \"a very British coup\" the plan would see May lose control of parliamentary business to MPs threatening her ability to govern according to the newspaper. It said Downing Street was \"extremely concerned\" about the possibility which could see lawmakers then delay Brexit through new legislation. Conservative MP Nick Boles who favours a Norway-style relationship with the bloc instead of May\\'s plan told the paper he was exploring tactics in the Commons to rule out no-deal. \"We have a mechanism which will give parliament control of the Brexit negotiations and ensure we do not leave the EU without a deal on March 29\" he said. \"I am working on ways to achieve that outcome\" Boles added noting he would publish the plan on Tuesday. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan has urged Prime Minister Theresa May to delay Britain\\'s departure from the European Union warning time has run out to rework her withdrawal agreement.\\xa0 \"It\\'s clear that we can\\'t reach a meaningful deal that\\'s agreed by parliament by March 29\" Khan from Britain\\'s main opposition Labour Party told AFP on Thursday. \"I\\'m hoping the prime minister sees sense and either extends the notice period for Article 50 or withdraws Article 50.\" Article 50 is the EU law that Britain invoked in 2017 triggering a two-year countdown to Brexit that ends at 11pm (2300 GMT) on March 29. The country is currently on course to leave without an agreement after MPs in January overwhelmingly rejected a divorce deal May struck with the EU late last year. The embattled leader is now seeking changes to the pact which she hopes will be enough to get it through parliament by March 12. In her revised strategy unveiled this week May has vowed that if her deal is rejected lawmakers will vote in the following days on whether to leave without a deal or delay Brexit briefly. But European leaders have warned any postponement would come with conditions. Khan a leading advocate for a second referendum on EU membership argued Thursday that freezing the process by unilaterally withdrawing Article 50 was the most feasible way forward. \"Lets do it... stop the clock\" he said. \"The deal the prime minister\\'s negotiated even if she\\'s able to improve it is a bad deal... parliament\\'s in gridlock.\\xa0 \"In those circumstances I think the British public should be allowed to... have a say\" the mayor added.\\xa0 \"Why are these Brexiteers so scared of giving the British public a say?\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn this week said the party would support holding a second referendum after its own Brexit plan was rejected by MPs. But May\\'s Conservatives are fiercly opposed to the move arguing it would be a betrayal of democracy. The mayor unveiled Thursday new research showing that despite heightened anxiety over the shape of Britain\\'s future relationship with the EU London attracted more foreign direct investment last year than any other city in the world. \"Even with the uncertainty that\\'s come with Brexit we\\'re going from strength to strength as a global financial capital and a hub for technology and innovation\" he said at a business awards event late Thursday. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain has begun issuing passports with the words \"European Union\" removed from the front cover - despite Brexit being delayed and uncertainty over when the country will leave the bloc. The interior ministry confirmed that some passports introduced from March 30 the day after Britain was originally due to depart no longer include references to the EU following a 2017 decision. However it said some newly-issued travel documents would still bear the bloc\\'s name - which has sat atop British passport covers - in a bid to save public money. \"In order to use leftover stock and achieve best value\\xa0for the taxpayer passports that include the words \\'European Union’ will continue to be issued for a short period\" a spokeswoman said. \"There will be no difference for British citizens whether they are using a passport that includes the words European Union or a passport that does not\" she added noting both designs would be \"equally valid for travel\". Britain was set to leave the EU on March 29 but has been forced to delay its exit amid political paralysis in Westminster over the terms of the divorce deal. Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday was forced to ask the bloc for another extension until June 30 to prevent the country crashing out next Friday without an accord. But it is unclear whether the other 27 EU members which must give unanimous backing will grant the request or insist on an even longer delay. British passports have become ensnared in the country\\'s Brexit divisions after the government announced in 2017 it would return to traditional blue passports \"to restore national identity\". The travel documents had dark blue covers from 1921 but Britain switched to burgundy from 1988 in common with other passports in what was then the European Community. Brexit backers are thrilled by the highly symbolic change while those who support remaining in the bloc have mocked their excitement. Last year it emerged that Franco-Dutch company Gemalto had won the contract to make the new blue passports prompting fury from Brexit campaigners and more ridicule from Remainers that a British company was not chosen. The new production contract is to begin in October 2019 with the passports currently being issued without reference to the EU on them still in the burgundy colour.

Britain\\'s pro-European Union Liberal Democrats party won a parliamentary seat previously held by the ruling Conservatives in a major upset it hailed as a rejection of a \"hard Brexit\" that would pull the country out of the single market. Liberal Democrat Sarah Olney\\'s victory in a constituency in southwest London - overturning the Conservatives\\' 23000 majority from 2015 - illustrated the deep divisions running through a country that voted 52-48 percent to leave the EU. It also reduces Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s already slim majority in parliament which might have to approve her decision to trigger the formal process of withdrawing from the bloc. The affluent Richmond Park and North Kingston area had backed the Remain camp in June\\'s referendum on EU membership. Olney who had campaigned for the parliamentary seat on a promise to vote against triggering the withdrawal talks said its residents had sent \"a shockwave\" through the Brexit process. \"Our message is clear: we do not want a hard Brexit; we do not want to be pulled out of the single market; and we will not let intolerance division and fear win\" she said in a speech after her victory was announced. Our message is clear: we do not want a hard Brexit; we do not want to be pulled out of the single market; and we will not let intolerance division and fear win She beat the incumbent Zac Goldsmith with 20510 votes to his 18638. Goldsmith ran as an independent candidate after quitting the Conservatives over the government\\'s decision to expand nearby Heathrow Airport. All the main candidates in Richmond opposed Heathrow expansion however and the Liberal Democrats turned the by-election into a vote on the terms of Brexit. Goldsmith the son of a billionaire financier was a longstanding supporter of Brexit. May\\'s Conservatives which did not field a candidate to oppose Goldsmith said the result did not change anything in terms of Britain\\'s Brexit strategy and invoking Article 50 of the EU\\'s Lisbon Treaty to begin the withdrawal process. \"The government remains committed to leaving the European Union and triggering Article 50 by the end of March next year\" a Conservative spokesman said on Friday. \\'WARNING\\' Since the June 23 vote to leave the EU - which was driven in part by a desire to curb immigration from the bloc - investors have been watching closely for any signs of the approach that the government will take in the trade-off between securing single market access and accepting some free movement of people. A speech made by May in early October which suggested she would take a hardline approach to the negotiations and prioritise border controls in a \"hard Brexit\" added to losses for sterling since the referendum. The pound has gained in recent days however on signs that the government might be softening its stance and seek to retain some access to the single market. It has also been boosted by a court ruling that parliament must vote on whether to trigger the divorce talks as investors believe lawmakers will seek to avoid a \"hard Brexit\". The government will appeal the ruling in the Supreme Court next week. The Liberal Democrats the junior partner in a coalition government with the Conservatives for five years before they were crushed at the 2015 general election have said they want a second referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal. \"What this by-election shows is that it\\'s a warning to all political parties as to potentially how disruptive this Brexit process is going to be for the regular practice of party politics\" polling expert John Curtice told the BBC. \"It is the impact of Brexit on our domestic party politics that is why this by-election matters.\" The Liberal Democrats held Richmond Park for 13 years until 2010. Their victory follows a strong second-place result for the party in an October by-election for a constituency vacated by former Prime Minister David Cameron. May\\'s Conservatives face another by-election on Dec. 8 after one of their lawmakers Stephen Phillips resigned in November citing \"irreconcilable policy differences\" with the government. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to reveal Monday what changes if any she has secured to her EU divorce deal on the eve of a crucial vote in parliament less than three weeks before Brexit day. Two months ago parliament overwhelmingly rejected the withdrawal agreement May has struck with the European Union and sent her back to Brussels to renegotiate. But as MPs prepare to vote again on the deal on Tuesday the prime minister has little to show for her efforts prompting warnings of another humiliating defeat. Our agreement provides meaningful clarifications & legal guarantees to the Withdrawal Agreement & #backstop. The choice is clear: it is this deal or #Brexit may not happen at all. Let’s bring the UK’s withdrawal to an orderly end. We owe it to history. https://t.co/lfy9eehEZi pic.twitter.com/XCqcLwZV7V Failure means Britain could end 46 years of ties with its closest trading partner on March 29 with no new arrangements in place causing huge disruption on both sides of the Channel. But it would also raise the possibility of a delay to Brexit. While europhiles in May\\'s Conservative Party would welcome a delay as a possible precursor to a second referendum on EU membership eurosceptics strongly oppose it. \\'Eight weeks of failure\\' British and European officials worked through the weekend to try to break the deadlock and May is ready to make a last-minute visit to Brussels if necessary to seal the deal. But the EU has already rejected most of her demands suggesting that any concessions she does get will not be enough to convince British lawmakers. The opposition Labour\\'s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer on Sunday railed against May for \"eight weeks of failure\" saying she was coming back with \"exactly what was rejected\". Ministers concede the deal is not perfect but say it is the best way to move forward and warn rejecting it could put Brexit at risk. In the face of a cabinet revolt May has promised that if MPs defeat her plan they will be able to vote this week on whether to leave the EU with no deal or seek a delay. \"There is a risk and possibility that we end up losing Brexit if we get the votes wrong in the next couple of weeks\" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC on Sunday. \\'Democratic disaster\\' The deal was struck over more than a year of tough negotiations and covers Britain\\'s financial settlement expatriate rights the Irish border and plans for a transition period. But MPs on all sides in London were swift to condemn it for a variety of reasons and it was rejected in January by 432 votes to 202. MPs then voted to ask May to seek changes to the most controversial element the backstop arrangement intended to keep the Irish border open after Brexit. This would keep Britain in the EU\\'s customs union and parts of its single market until and unless another way - such as a trade deal - is found to avoid frontier checks. Many MPs fear it is a trap to keep them tied to EU rules but Brussels has rejected calls for a time limit or unilateral exit clause. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier repeated on Friday that the bloc could offer a legally binding statement confirming the backstop was only meant to be temporary. But this offer from the Frenchman - who spent Sunday watching the rugby Six Nations in Dublin with Irish premier Leo Varadkar - is unlikely to be enough. \"It is inevitable this unchanged withdrawal agreement will be voted down again\" two senior Brexit-supporting MPs Steve Baker and Nigel Dodds warned on Sunday. Fellow MP Jacob Rees-Mogg an influential Brexit supporter wrote in the Express: \"Leaving without an agreement is nothing to be frightened about. It opens the door to prosperity\". If the deal is rejected May has promised a vote on Thursday on a short delay to Brexit but warned MPs they could not put off taking a decision. Any delay would have to be approved by the leaders of the other 27 nations who are next meeting at a Brussels summit on March 21-22 - a week before Brexit day. Former Brexit minister David Davis said that postponing Britain\\'s departure would let down all those who voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum. It would be a \"democratic disaster\" he told the BBC on Sunday adding: \"Britain would get its Trump moment.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Updated 11.15am British Prime Minister Theresa May is making the rounds of European leaders on Tuesday seeking support for changes to her Brexit deal in a last ditch bid to save it after calling off a vote that she admitted she was on course to lose. Less than four months until the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29 Brexit was plunged into chaos on Monday when May accepted that British lawmakers would not accept her deal to keep close ties after leaving the EU. That leaves a range of possible outcomes - from a chaotic Brexit with no deal which businesses say would cause an economic crisis by cutting off their supply lines to risking the wrath of pro-Brexit voters by calling the whole thing off. May still hopes to hang on to power and revive her deal by agreeing \"reassurances\" from the EU to win over lawmakers. The British pound has plunged because of the uncertainty. Amid demands for a national election ridicule and blunt warnings that her eleventh-hour bid for a changed deal was in vain May pledged to seek EU support for changes to make it more palatable to lawmakers.  The EU said it was ready to discuss how to ease ratification in Britain but was adamant that the withdrawal agreement could not be renegotiated including its most contentious element a \"backstop\" for the Northern Ireland frontier. The backstop assuring the only British-EU land border stays open no matter what could require Britain to obey EU rules indefinitely. It cuts to the heart of the Brexit dilemma: Britain\\'s wish to set its own rules while still trading friction free with the world\\'s biggest market. \"Sometimes I don’t understand the world anymore. We spent so much time energy and creativity to negotiate something we in Berlin and Brussels don’t want. Nobody wants the UK to leave\" Germany\\'s European Affairs Minister Michael Roth said. \"I cannot imagine where we could change something substantial in the withdrawal agreement. We can not restart the talks because it was already difficult enough among the EU 27 and UK to agree on this deal.\" Monday\\'s line from EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker seemed to leave little wiggle room: \"We have an agreement on the table\" he said through a spokeswoman. \"We will not renegotiate.\" May met Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in The Hague for breakfast. She will later meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin and then Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk who will convene an EU summit on Thursday. BREXIT UNDONE? In a boisterous parliamentary debate on Monday May said the deeper question was whether lawmakers wanted to deliver on the people\\'s will from the 2016 referendum or open up divisions with another national vote. \"If you take a step back it is clear that the House faces a much more fundamental question. Does this House want to deliver Brexit?\" May said. Both May\\'s ruling Conservatives and the main opposition Labour Party have pledged to implement the results of the 2016 referendum in which British voters backed exiting the EU 52 per cent to 48 per cent. Three out of four living prime ministers and a growing chorus of backbench lawmakers say a new vote is the only way out of the impasse. Among Brexit opponents there is mounting enthusiasm for a chance to have another say. But many Brexit supporters say that would be a betrayal. Many business chiefs fear a chaotic Brexit that they say would wreck their supply lines. Some are hoping that May\\'s failure will bring an end to a Brexit they never supported. \"We view the situation with a mixture of worry and hope\" one CEO said of a FTSE-listed company said on condition of anonymity. \"The hope comes from the fact that it\\'s now such chaos it gets called off.\" As investors and allies tried to work out the ultimate destination for the world\\'s fifth-largest economy rebel lawmakers in May\\'s party said she had to go. \"If we can\\'t go forwards with her deal ... then I\\'m afraid the only way to change the policy is to change the prime minister and I really think it\\' her duty to go\" Brexit-supporting Conservative lawmaker Steve Baker said. A leadership challenge is triggered if 48 Conservatives write letters demanding one to the chairman of the party\\'s so-called 1922 committee Graham Brady. The Labour Party was urged by other smaller opposition parties to trigger a vote of no confidence in the government but said it would not act right away. \"We will put down a motion of no confidence when we judge it most likely to be successful\" a spokesman said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 13:41  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Adds Labour second referendum announcement The European Union opened the door Monday to Britain postponing its exit from the bloc beyond the March 29 deadline as the main opposition Labour Party said it could eventually support a second referendum. European Council President Donald Tusk said he had discussed the \"legal and procedural context of a potential extension\" when he met Sunday with British Prime Minister Theresa May on the sidelines of an EU-Arab summit in Egypt\\'s Sharm el-Sheikh. \"I believe in the situation we are in an extension would be a rational solution but Prime Minister May still believes she\\'s able to avoid this scenario\" Tusk told a closing summit press conference. The EU has been watching with growing alarm the possibility that Britain will crash out of the bloc without a deal risking chaos on both sides of the Channel. - Second referendum? -Britain remains as divided as ever over Brexit which a narrow majority of voters called for in a June 2016 referendum. May sparked outrage at home when she suggested Sunday that parliament may not be able to vote on her Brexit deal until March 12 just 17 days before Britain leaves the EU. The decision increases the chances that lawmakers will in a series of votes this week move to delay Brexit beyond March 29 to avoid a no-deal Brexit. The opposition Labour Party on Monday raised the pressure saying it would put forward its own plan for Brexit which calls for Britain to stay in the EU customs union as part of those votes. Labour then said if its plan was rejected it would lend its support to an amendment on holding a second referendum on EU membership \\xa0-- without specifying a date.. \"We are committed to... putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a statement. Corbyn a lifelong eurosceptic who supports Brexit has been highly ambiguous throughout the negotiations even though many of his MPs support a second referendum. Meanwhile May says she is still discussing with the EU possible amendments to the Brexit deal\\'s arrangements for the Irish border. Taking a united stand the EU and its remaining 27 countries have repeatedly rebuffed May\\'s efforts to reopen the Brexit deal struck with her government in November. Since lawmakers overwhelmingly rejected her withdrawal deal last month the Conservative prime minister has sought to address their concerns about the text\\'s \"backstop\" arrangement. - \\'Achieve that deal\\' -London wants the \"backstop\" -- the clause binding Northern Ireland into the EU customs union if a new deal to keep the Irish border open is not found -- to be time-limited or to be allowed to unilaterally end it. The EU opposes any changes to an arrangement designed to keep the border between British Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland flowing. It also sees the \"backstop\" as an insurance policy for the peace process in the British province of Northern Ireland. Brussels however is not budging though it is offering political reassurances. Tusk said \"we\\'ll face an alternative chaotic Brexit or an extension\" under the current circumstances where it is \"absolutely clear\" to him there is no majority in the British parliament for May\\'s deal. Tusk said he told May that \"no matter which scenario all 27 (EU countries) will show maximum understanding and good will\". During a press conference Monday in Sharm El-Sheikh May said she believes she can still deliver Brexit on time. \"I\\'ve had a real sense from the meetings I\\'ve had here and the conversations I\\'ve had in recent days that we can achieve that deal\" May said. The European Commission the EU\\'s executive arm leading the Brexit negotiations is still working on the assumption that Britain will leave the bloc on March 29 commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva told reporters earlier in Brussels. She recalled that Britain would first have to request an extension and the remaining 27 EU countries would have to agree to it unanimously.

The chances of Britain ending up outside the single market when Brexit talks are concluded have receded somewhat after last week\\'s election although the pound might weaken further against other currencies a Reuters poll of economists found. Ahead of the election Prime Minister Theresa\\xa0May\\xa0had been expected to win a landslide victory - an outcome Reuters polls had predicted would be best for both sterling and Brexit talks - but as voting day approached those opinion polls narrowed. In the end\\xa0May\\'s Tory party failed to win a majority in parliament prompting calls for her plan to leave the EU\\'s single market to be watered down and leading some rival lawmakers to demand the Brexit process be delayed. Droves of newly registered young voters - many of whom voted to stay in the EU - backed the opposition Labour Party scuppering\\xa0May\\'s hopes of a walkover win. Around two-thirds of the economists polled this week 33 out of 49 said the chance of a hard Brexit had receded somewhat. Three said it had receded significantly while eight said there was no change. Five said it had increased somewhat and none said increased significantly. \"The prime minister\\xa0may\\xa0have to change her stance and approach to Brexit following the election outcome\" said Nikesh Sawjani at Lloyds Banking Group. May has two years to reach agreement with the European Union but has repeatedly said she would be prepared to walk away from negotiations without a deal if necessary May\\xa0has two years to reach agreement with the European Union but has repeatedly said she would be prepared to walk away from negotiations without a deal if necessary. But she now might find that more difficult to do. \"The reduced majority of the Conservatives means that the mandate for a hard Brexit just isn\\'t there anymore\" said George Brown at the CBI. Concern over immigration from other EU member states was a major reason behind the vote to leave and\\xa0May\\xa0has said she will respect those fears by halting freedom of movement. That would almost certainly mean no free access for British companies to the EU\\'s huge single market likely damaging what already threatens to be weak economic growth. Almost half of British employers are unprepared for the government\\'s planned changes to immigration rules after Brexit a survey from the Resolution Foundation think tank showed on Monday. Another survey found British business confidence has fallen sharply since the election while figures showed consumers cut their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month as households turned more cautious. Having fallen as much as 23 percent after the referendum nearly a year ago touching a 31-year low below $1.15 in October sterling\\xa0is currently trading around $1.26. On Friday the pound sank to a two-month low and 26 of 50 respondents said it was likely to fall more in the next few months. Fifteen said there would be no change and nine predicted sterling would recoup some of its losses. \"With markets unduly optimistic about the prospect of a Tory-led coalition sterling is vulnerable to a further sell-off\" said Joanna Davies at Fathom. Medians in a Reuters poll of 60 specialists taken before the election predicted the pound will be at $1.28 in one month $1.27 in six and then at $1.28 in a year. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:08  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has delivered a fresh rebuke to Theresa May over her government\\'s handling of the Brexit process. Mr Juncker said official papers setting out the Government\\'s positions were not satisfactory and it was \"crystal clear\" that an \"enormous amount\" of issues needed to be settled before talks on a future trade deal could begin. Officials from Brussels and the UK were continuing negotiations in the latest round of the withdrawal process but Mr Juncker\\'s comments are further evidence of the European Union\\'s frustration with the approach being taken by the Prime Minister and Brexit Secretary David Davis. READ: Talks are moving too slowly EU\\'s chief negotiator complains His comments came after Brussels\\' chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he was concerned about the lack of clarity and insisted \"we must start negotiating seriously\". Mr Juncker said the UK \"hesitates showing all its cards\" but added: \"I did read with the requisite attention all the papers produced by Her Majesty\\'s Government and none of those is actually satisfactory. READ: I\\'m starting to believe Brexit won\\'t happen says Muscat \"So there is still an enormous amount of issues which remain to be settled. \"Not just on the border problems regarding Ireland and Northern Ireland which is a very serious problem in respect of which we have had no definitive response but we also have the status of European citizens living in the UK and UK citizens living on the Continent. READ: Show some Brexit imagination UK tells EU \"We need to be crystal clear that we will commence no negotiations on the new relationship - particularly a new economic and trade relationship - between the UK and the EU before all these questions are resolved.\" Mr Juncker added: \"First of all we settle the past before we look forward to the future.\" Mr Davis and Mr Barnier met on Monday at the start of the latest round of talks which highlighted differences between Brussels and Whitehall over the negotiating papers produced by the UK. Mr Barnier said: \"We need UK papers that are clear in order to have constructive negotiations. And the sooner we remove the ambiguity the sooner we will be in a position to discuss the future relationship and a transitional period.\" Mr Davis insisted the UK position papers produced in recent weeks - on issues including Northern Ireland and the continued access of goods to market - were strong in detail. He said: \"They are the products of hard work and detailed thinking that has been going on behind the scenes not just the last few weeks but for the last 12 months and should form the basis of what I hope will be a constructive week of talks.\" Meanwhile Labour\\'s new Brexit stance was branded chaotic by one of the party\\'s Leave-supporting MPs. Blackley and Broughton MP Graham Stringer hit out at a sudden policy shift announced by shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer committing the party to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union for up to four years after EU withdrawal in March 2019. Mr Stringer told the BBC: \"What Keir said seems completely at odds with what the leader of the party the shadow chancellor of the exchequer have said. \"They have made it quite clear that we cannot honour the decision of the referendum if we remain in the customs union and the single market. \"So I think it\\'s a bit of chaos at the centre of the party - makes no sense to me whatsoever.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Banks have failed to make enough progress on their Brexit preparations and should not expect \"miracle\" public intervention to help them the European Union\\'s banking watchdog said on Monday. While Britain and the EU have agreed in principle on a transition deal lasting from Brexit next March to the end of 2020 it is part of a broader divorce settlement that has yet to be formally adopted. Banks\\' preparations for the potential departure of Britain from the EU without a ratified withdrawal agreement are inadequate the European Banking Authority (EBA) said in a statement on Brexit.\\xa0This should be a wake up call. Time is running out in some cases it has run out and don\\'t assume there will be a transition period \"This should be a wake up call. Time is running out in some cases it has run out and don\\'t assume there will be a transition period\" said Piers Haben EBA director of banking markets innovation and consumers. Banks in Britain are submitting applications for licences to set up or expand operations in the EU to ensure continuity of service after March. UK branches of banks from the EU need permission to continue serving customers in the United Kingdom. \"Big banks can\\'t assume they can put off the full application process\" Haben said. The EBA said banks must have enough staff at new operations to manage risks from the first day after Britain\\'s withdrawal on March 29 2019 and financial stability must not be put at risk because lenders want to avoid costs. The EBA - itself relocating from London to Paris by March due to Brexit - said preparations by banks must advance more rapidly in a number of areas without further delay. Lenders in Britain and the EU should quantify exposures to counterparties in each other\\'s jurisdictions including the billions of euros in cross-border derivatives contracts. The Bank of England (BoE) has said UK and EU legislation is needed to ensure continuity in contracts that span many years in some cases. The EU has shown no willingness to legislate and the EBA said no public solution may be proposed or even agreed in time. The European Central Bank and BoE are in talks on how to keep markets orderly around Brexit Day next March raising expectations that some public action will take place. \"There is widespread perception there will be a public policy miracle. I don\\'t think banks can rely on a general catch-all public intervention\" Haben said. The watchdog sets out a \"sequence\" of tasks banks must complete. The EBA said banks should explain to regulators how they will continue to swap data between units in Britain and the EU without falling foul of data protection rules. EU-based lenders will also have to explain if any bonds they have issued under UK law remain valid after Brexit for plugging capital shortfalls in a crisis. Continental lenders must also show how they could meet potentially higher capital charges for exposures to UK assets no longer deemed to be covered under EU law. The EBA also wants details about where and how banks will book and manage risks from market transactions after Brexit. Banks must tell customers in clear language what they can expect to happen next March. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The spokesman told reporters that trade minister Liam Fox was right to highlight in an interview at the weekend the risk of Britain crashing out from the EU which helped push the pound down to an 11-month low. \"We continue to believe that a deal is the most likely outcome because reaching a good deal is not only in the interests of the UK it is in the interests of the EU and its 27 members\" the spokesman said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:08  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Having sunk to 13-month lows sterling could fall by up to another 10 percent in the coming months should Britain crash out of the European Union without a deal on future trade ties luring more speculators to bet against the currency. Sterling lost almost 2 per cent last week just as British holidaymakers were heading off for some overseas sun. The latest move lower was kickstarted by trade minister Liam Fox\\'s warning that with Britain less than eight months from its scheduled EU departure date in March there was a 60 per cent chance of leaving without a deal. The moves were certainly exacerbated by a big and broad dollar rally and the pound has since clawed back the worst of its losses against the euro rebounding from 10-month lows.\\xa0Reuters polls indicate risk of no deal have risen to 25 per cent versus 20 per cent in July. But the worry say analysts is that in the absence of any conclusive developments towards a deal over the coming months the pound\\'s spiral will accelerate while the clock ticks down on the deadline and hedge funds are tempted into betting against the currency. And muddying the horizon are major political events: Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Conservative Party conference in early October and meetings of EU leaders in late September and then mid-October. \"There\\'s no guaranteed date for when Brexit progress or hard Brexit will be known by apart from exit day on March 29 2019\" Nomura analysts told clients describing a \"hard Brexit\" as a \"cliff edge\" moment in which Britain crashes out of the EU in March 2019 without any future trading arrangements in place. \"We find that we are very much in the early stages of pricing for a hard Brexit.\" How will sterling trade in the later stages then? Most economists still believe Britain will reach a deal with the EU. But the latest Reuters polls indicate risk of no deal have risen to 25 per cent versus 20 per cent in July. Some bookmakers price even higher odds above 40 per cent. If that comes to pass Britain\\'s currency would crash to $1.20 - from today\\'s $1.2750 levels the Reuters poll showed a fall of around 6 per cent. But sterling is forecast to rise to $1.34 by end-January if an agreement is reached. Others predict more precipitous falls: Commerzbank sees a 10 per cent drop against the dollar and euro. That would leave the pound close to parity with the single currency below post-Brexit referendum lows of 94 pence and current levels of 89.2 pence. CHEAP AS CHIPS? Should Britain retain close trading ties with the EU the pound could jump towards its post-Brexit referendum high of $1.4377 reached in April. A Brexit on these terms would also clear the path for the Bank of England to tighten monetary policy further. Sterling also looks cheap according to some historical measures. Using the real effective exchange rate or REER gauge - a currency\\'s value against trade partners\\' currencies adjusted for inflation - sterling is 6 per cent below its five-year average and 16 perc ent below its 20-year average. Under the purchasing-power parity or PPP theory which compares the prices of a basket of goods sterling/dollar should trade at $1.61 and euro/sterling at 80 pence. \"Sure there is gloom now but the currency remains undervalued as it has been historically\" said Geoffrey Yu Head of UK Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management. \"Some [buyers] will see this as an opportunity.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain should be allowed to unilaterally revoke its departure notice from the European Union an adviser to the bloc\\'s highest court said on Tuesday before a landmark ruling in the coming weeks. The non-binding opinion for the European Court of Justice (ECJ) comes as the British parliament begins five days of debate on Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s proposed Brexit deal with the EU before voting on it next Tuesday. \"Advocate General (Manuel) Campos Sanchez-Bordona proposes that the Court of Justice should declare that Article 50 ... allows the unilateral revocation of the notification of the intention to withdraw from the EU\" the ECJ said. \"That possibility continues to exist until such time as the withdrawal agreement is formally concluded\" it said in a statement meaning Britain would have to notify the EU that it has changed its mind before Brexit day on March 29 2019. \"The Advocate General emphasises that withdrawal from an international treaty which is the reverse of treaty-making power is by definition a unilateral act of a state party and a manifestation of its sovereignty\" the court also said. \"A member state which decides to withdraw is to notify the European Council of \\'its intention\\' - and not of its decision - to withdraw and such an intention may change\" it added. \"It would be illogical to force that member state to withdraw from the EU in order to then have to negotiate its accession.\" The court which tends to follow the advocate general\\'s opinion in its final decisions did not give an exact date for the ruling but it is expected in the coming weeks. Opposition in Parliament May has agreed an exit pact and an outline of future EU-UK ties with the other 27 states staying on together after Brexit. But the proposed accord still needs the endorsement of the British parliament where it faces stiff opposition. The other EU states as well as the bloc\\'s executive want any revocation of Britain\\'s withdrawal notice to require the consent of the bloc fearing that otherwise Britain or other would be leavers could use this tactic to win concessions. Tuesday\\'s opinion rejects that argument but says that \"good faith and sincere cooperation must also be observed\" in any withdrawal of the exit notice. The case was brought before the ECJ by Scottish politicians opposed to Brexit. They hope it could pave the way for a potential second Brexit referendum giving voters the option to remain in the EU. \"That puts the decision about our future back into the hands of our own elected representatives\" said Jo Maugham one of the lawyers involved in the case. Both May and the EU have said that if the British parliament votes this offer down Britain would risk crashing out of the bloc with no deal in place to mitigate the damage. May says it would risk not delivering the Brexit that the British people voted for. But the tentative deal is also opposed by advocates of a sharp break from the EU and she is struggling to get enough backing for it even within her own party. \"Every effort is being made on both sides of the Channel to stop Brexit\" prominent \\'Leave\\' campaigner Nigel Farage said after the ECJ statement. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:08  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: AFP  The European Union is prepared to give Britain further Brexit guarantees to help a divorce deal through the British parliament the bloc\\'s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said in an interview published Saturday. \"We can find guarantees to confirm clarify guarantee the goodwill and good faith of the Europeans with commitments which would have real legal force\" Barnier said in comments published in several European newspapers including Die Welt in Germany and Les Echos in France. Barnier also suggested European leaders would be amenable to a short \"technical\" delay in Britain\\'s departure from the EU scheduled for March 29 to give the British parliament time to formally ratify a final divorce deal. The British parliament rejected the original Brexit deal hammered out by Prime Minister Theresa May and EU leaders. The major sticking point was the so-called \"backstop\" plan for the Irish border. Some MPs fear the arrangement which would keep Britain tied to EU trade rules until another way is found to keep the frontier open is a \"trap\" that could bind it to European commerce rules indefinitely. Theresa May is facing pressure from either side of the Brexit debate in the UK. Photo: AFP Barnier said there was \"misunderstanding\" over the proposed backstop deal. \"Limiting it in time or introducing a unilateral exit clause would call into question its credibility\" the EU\\'s top Brexit negotiator insisted. The backstop \"will end either when we have a global agreement on the future relationship or a specific agreement with Ireland\" he said assuring it \"was never the wish\" to bind Britain to European trade rules indefinitely. Meetings next week\\xa0 Barnier said he would Britain\\'s Brexit minister Stephen Barclay and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox next week to discuss options. A Brussels source said those talks could take place in the Belgian capital on Tuesday. \"There is a way that the British (parliament) could vote between now and March 12 with these guarantees of our good faith It will be up to them to fulfil their responsibilities\" Barnier said. In 2017 Britain invoked Article 50 of EU law triggering a two-year countdown to Brexit that ends at 11pm (2300 GMT) on March 29. The country is on course to leave without an agreement after British MPs in January overwhelmingly rejected the divorce deal May struck with the EU late last year. The embattled leader is now seeking changes to the pact which she hopes will be enough to get it through parliament by March 12. In a revised strategy unveiled this week May vowed that if her deal is rejected lawmakers will vote in the following days on whether to leave without a deal or delay Brexit. But European leaders have warned any postponement would come with conditions. Barnier suggested a short delay could be acceptable. \"The European institutions will do whatever is necessary on their side but the British have told us in the past that they will need two months to ratify\" the deal. \"It would then require a simple technical extension.\" While Britain is yet to request a delay \"I don\\'t think there would be any objections in principle\" from the other 27 EU nations Barnier said. However any delay \"must serve to solve a problem not merely to postpone it and remain at an impasse.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:08  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Christian Hartmann/Reuters  Top French financiers will travel to the United States in May to try to attract US business to Paris following Britain’s decision to quit the European Union. Paris Europlace – an organisation representing French business and finance – said in its March newsletter that it would hold roadshows in Boston and New York on May 22 and 23 aimed at persuading US finance companies to choose Paris as their European base. The organisation said it had already held about 100 meetings with executives of large international banks as well as asset management investment insurance and fintech companies in London New York Shanghai and Tokyo and these had shown a “clear interest” in Paris. French officials have already held events in London this year to try to lure financial jobs over to Paris in the wake of the Brexit vote Both France and Germany have stepped up efforts to try to replace London’s traditional role as Europe’s main centre of business following Britain’s vote for Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May formally began Britain’s divorce from the EU on Wednesday declaring there was no turning back and opening a tortuous exit process that will test the bloc’s cohesion and pitch her country into the unknown.

Britain raised its forecasts for economic growth this year but was more downbeat about the following three years Chancellor Philip Hammond said in the first full budget since the referendum decision to leave the European Union. Delivering his budget statement just weeks before Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to kick off the process of leaving the EU Hammond said Britain’s economy had “continued to confound the commentators” with its growth in 2016. “As we start our negotiations to exit the European Union this Budget takes forward our plan to prepare Britain for a brighter future” Hammond told Parliament. “It provides a strong and stable platform for those negotiations.” Britain’s economy is now expected to grow by two per cent in 2017 up sharply from a forecast of 1.4 per cent made in the latest round of official forecasts in November according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). However the growth outlook for this year remained lower than a forecast of 2.2 per cent made a year ago before the unexpected Brexit vote which is expected to weigh on the economy in the years ahead. Furthermore the forecasts for growth 2018 2019 and 2020 were lowered from November’s outlook. Hammond has previously said that rather than use the better outlook to spend more he would focus on eliminating what remains one of the biggest budget deficits among the world’s rich nations something he was aiming to do in the first half of the next decade. Hammond nicknamed ‘Spreadsheet Phil’ for his unflashy approach to running the economy wants to build up a reserve fund in case he needs to help Britain’s economy through a Brexit slowdown ahead. The Brexit vote in June which will separate Britain from the EU which buys about half of its exports had been expected to deliver a quick and heavy below to the economy. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:08  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  The sums of money the European Union is to demand from Britain as part of its Brexit settlement \"seem to be extortionate\" British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said today. The EU wants an agreement on how the \"Brexit bill\" will be calculated before launching talks on a free trade agreement. It puts Britain\\'s financial settlement at tens of billions of euros and includes covering a share of future EU budget commitments made while it was a member. There is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a great deal Asked by a lawmaker in parliament if the EU should be told to \"go whistle\" if it wants money from Britain to leave the bloc Johnson said: \"I think that the sums that I have seen ... seem to me to be extortionate and I think go whistle is an entirely appropriate expression.\" The phrase means to ask for something with little chance of obtaining it. British Prime Minister Theresa May has said she could walk away from the EU without a Brexit agreement if she believed the deal on offer was worse than not reaching any arrangement. Johnson said this was unlikely as it was in the interests of both sides to reach an understanding but asked to spell out what \"no deal\" would mean he said: \"There is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a great deal.\" May\\'s spokesman said contingency planning was taking place for \"a range of scenarios\". \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:08  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The third round of Brexit negotiations focussed on settling the terms of Britain\\'s exit from the EU ended yesterday with a warning from Brussels that more work needed to be done before they moved on to discuss future ties.

The so-called Brexit bill is a contentious issue both domestically where eurosceptics are keen to see as little money paid as possible and with the EU which is demanding Britain meets its existing commitments to the bloc. Britain has said it is prepared to meet its international obligations. Fox said businesses across Europe had told him they were keen to see more detail on what Britain\\'s new relationship with the EU would look like. \"We think we should begin discussions on the final settlement because that\\'s good for business and it\\'s good for the prosperity both of the British people and of the rest of the people of the European Union\" Fox said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:08  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain will mint a new 50 pence coin to commemorate leaving the European Union in spring 2019 the finance ministry said. The departure is one of a series of historic moments such as the 2012 Olympics the decision to join the European Economic Community the predecessor to the EU in 1973 and the centenary of the First World War it said. \"In line with this tradition the Royal Mint will produce a coin to commemorate the UK leaving the European Union\" it said. The official coin. The news came in a video on the finance ministry\\'s Twitter feed in which a seven-sided silver-coloured 50 pence piece was seen with \"Peace prosperity and friendship with all nations\" emblazoned on it and Brexit day \"March 29 2019\". The announcement formed part of the annual budget. Brexit continues to divide Britain more than two years after a referendum that returned a 52-48 per cent decision. Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to reach agreement with the EU and her Conservative party and other rivals are also split on the issue. News of the coin received a mixed reaction on social media. \"One side features the Queen with her head in her hand quietly sobbing while the other has a comprehensive list of the benefits the people of the UK will receive on leaving the EU\" one user joked. The other side of the coin was pictured blank.

If those two options are rejected the government would put forward \"a motion on whether parliament wants to see a short limited extension to Article 50\" May said adding that any delay could only be until the end of June. The prime minister said she still wanted Brexit to happen on the scheduled date of March 29 and repeated her promise to hold a parliamentary vote on her deal on March 12. If the deal is rejected as it was overwhelmingly by parliament last month the government would then hold a vote on March 13 on whether MPs want a no-deal Brexit. The vote on a possible delay would be the following day. \"Let me be clear I do not want to see Article 50 extended. Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on March 29\" she told parliament. She added: \"I believe that if we have to we will ultimately make a success of no deal\". May said her new commitments were a response to MPs who were \"genuinely worried about time running out\". Six ministers have threatened to resign in recent days unless May rules out Britain crashing out of the European Union after 46 years with no agreement in place. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The EU\\'s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier will meet Britain\\'s negotiating team on Tuesday an EU spokesman said as both sides seek a breakthrough in the thorny Irish border issue. Barnier \"will meet tomorrow afternoon\" with the UK attorney general Geoffrey Cox and Britain\\'s Brexit minister Stephen Barclay European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a regular news briefing on Monday. The meeting to take place in Brussels comes after Barnier said on Saturday that the European Union was ready to give Britain further guarantees to help push a troubled divorce deal through the British parliament. Barnier also suggested European leaders would be amenable to a short \"technical\" delay in Britain\\'s departure from the EU scheduled for March 29 to give the British parliament time to formally ratify a final divorce deal. The small overture to Britain has raised hopes that both sides can find a solution including to the so-called \"backstop\" plan for the Irish border a major sticking point for many MPs in British parliament. In 2017 Britain invoked Article 50 of EU law triggering a two-year countdown to Brexit that ends at 11pm (2300 GMT) on March 29. The country is on course to leave without an agreement if British MPs fail to approve a divorce deal struck by British Prime Minister Theresa May that was overwhelmingly rejected in a first vote in January. The embattled leader is now seeking changes to the pact which she hopes will be enough to get it through parliament by March 12. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British employment has reached a record-high level shaking off stubborn uncertainty surrounding the UK\\'s departure from the European Union official data showed on Tuesday. \"The level of employment in the UK increased by 179000 to a record high of 32.72 million people in the three months to February 2019\" the Office for National Statistics said in a statement. That was the highest level since records began in 1971 according to the ONS. The unemployment rate remained at 3.9 per cent the lowest level since 1975. \"The UK job market remained encouragingly buoyant in February with a combination of rising employment and falling unemployment pushing pay up at one of the fastest rates seen since the global financial crisis over 10 years ago\" noted Christopher Williamson chief business economist at IHS Markit. \"However forward-looking survey data suggest that demand for staff has cooled which will likely feed through to weaker jobs growth and easing pay pressures in coming months.\"\\xa0 European leaders last week agreed with British Prime Minister Theresa May to delay Brexit until October 31 at the latest saving the continent from a chaotic no-deal departure. The delay avoids a possible economic calamity on both sides of the Channel but does little to resolve the political morass that has seen May\\'s control over her MPs and cabinet gradually slip. Following Tuesday\\'s jobs data analysts at Capital Economics said Brexit was \"not applying the brakes to hiring\" just yet in the UK. \"However we suspect that this could mark the peak of employment growth as the Brexit uncertainty reached its crescendo... and the surveys turned down sharply in March\" they added in a note to clients.

The “Remain” camp holds a 13-point lead over “Leave” rivals in Britain’s EU referendum campaign after winning support for the first time from a majority of men those aged over 65 and Conservative voters according to a poll from ORB published in yesterday’s edition of the Telegraph newspaper. The poll found that among those who definitely plan to vote support for remaining in the union stood at 55 per cent while that for Brexit was at 42 per cent. The three voter groups of men older people and Tory supporters had all favoured leaving the European Union when they were surveyed in March the newspaper said but a majority of each now backed “Remain”. Pensioners previously considered to be the most reliable Brexit supporters now narrowly favoured staying in the union the survey found with 52 per cent of the over-65s intending to vote to “Remain” and 44 per cent backing “Leave”. Britons will vote on June 23 on whether to remain in the 28-member bloc. ORB has been polling 800 voters by telephone for the Telegraph in a series of polls since March. It has said the data has been weighted to be demographically and politically representative of Britain. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Salaries for British workers starting in permanent jobs rose at the fastest pace since 2015 as businesses found it harder to hire staff a problem exacerbated by Brexit a survey of recruitment firms showed on Friday. The signs of pay pressure in the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) survey contrast with Britain’s official measure of growth in earnings which has weakened recently. Growth in starting salaries for permanent jobs hit a 19-month high in June in June REC said offering Bank of England policymakers a rare suggestion that wage growth in Britain will accelerate as they expect. “With fewer people currently looking for jobs employers are having to increase starting salaries to secure the talent they need” Tom Hadley REC Director of Policy said. “Existing skills shortages are being exacerbated by Brexit. For example demand for accountants and other financial roles has increased recently as organisations try to protect themselves against economic uncertainty.” Other indicators of pay have been weak. Official data showed wages grew at the slowest pace since February last year in the three months to April rising 2.1 per cent on the year and falling further behind inflation which is close to three per cent. Other business surveys have also pointed to weak upward pressure on wages. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said: \"With Northern Irish exports to the Republic of Ireland valued at £2.4 billion in 2016 it is vitally important we reach a sensible agreement on the border issue which allows firms on both sides of the border to flourish.\" She added it \"is clear there is full agreement from both sides of the border on the challenges a mismanaged Brexit would pose to businesses both north and south\". Ms Fairbain met business leaders in Northern Ireland this week to talk about critical issues for cross-border trade. Danny McCoy chief executive of Ibec a group which represents Irish business both domestically and internationally said: \"An early focus on avoiding a hard border with Northern Ireland is vital but the Irish approach must also be informed by the greater economic importance of the east-west Irish-British trading relationship. \"Across both trade and investments the outcome of negotiations must not disadvantage Ireland. \"Any future EU-UK deal must facilitate the closest possible tariff-free economic trading and business relationship between the EU and UK into the future and should be as broad comprehensive and as ambitious as possible covering both goods and services.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

International banks are planning to set up subsidiaries in the EU to ensure they can continue to serve clients if their London operations lose the ability to operate in the bloc after Britain leaves in March 2019. Details of banks\\' Brexit arrangements are starting to emerge following a July 14 deadline for them to submit details of their contingency plans to the Bank of England. \"Bank of America has operated in Ireland and engaged in the local community for almost 50 years\" said Brian Moynihan Chairman and CEO of Bank of America.

Brexit fatigue is permeating Britain as the final moves in the long-running saga create confusion and unease about how it will all end up. EU leaders on Thursday agreed to extend the Brexit deadline triggered two years ago leaving the final date of Britain\\'s withdrawal in doubt. A British government source earlier this week said it was like witnessing \"the last days of Rome\" as Prime Minister Theresa May failed to secure Brexit by the original scheduled date of March 29. The Conservative leader on Thursday persuaded EU leaders to delay Brexit until May 22 if next week - at the third time of asking - they can agree to the divorce deal struck between London and Brussels and April 12 or a later date if they cannot. Even the normally reserved May snapped on Wednesday voicing her frustration at MPs\\' inability to get it \"over and done with\". European leaders and analysts believe she still faces a mountain to climb in order to get MPs to back the withdrawal agreement. \"It\\'s possible that she will convert enough of the dissenters to enable her vote to pass on the fourth or fifth attempt\" Professor Iain Begg from the European Institute at the London School of Economics university told AFP. \"But the current indications are no: there are too many ERG hardliners who will never accept her deal\" he said referring to the European Research Group of hardcore Conservative Brexiteers. What do MPs want? Consensus amongst British lawmakers seems as distant as ever even as they prepare for the possibility of a series of votes next week aimed at finding a Brexit strategy that commands a majority in parliament. Nearly three years after the British electorate voted to leave the EU in a seismic 2016 referendum their MPs - the vast majority of whom backed staying in the bloc - are still torn apart on how to do it. And some don\\'t want to do it at all. \"They have rejected every proposal to make Brexit a reality\" Vernon Bogdanor research professor at the Centre for British Politics and Government at King\\'s College London university wrote in The Guardian. They have twice heavily voted against the withdrawal agreement struck between May and the 27 other EU leaders. They have voted against a no-deal exit against a second referendum and against the main opposition Labour party\\'s demand to stay in the customs union. \"In one sense what Theresa May is saying is correct: parliament knows what it is against but it has to articulate what it\\'s for\" said Begg. And if it can\\'t MPs might test the weary public\\'s patience to the limits with Brexit overtaking almost all aspects of British public life. Demonstrations demanding Brexit be implemented or voted on again are taking place over the coming days while a petition calling for Britain to stay in the EU has topped more than three million signatures. Liberal newspaper The Guardian said Brexit had revealed a country that was \"incoherent entitled incapable of compromise... wholly unrealistic and startlingly ignorant\" about the European Union. \\'I hate them all\\' Journalists are not spared Brexit fatigue. \"I sat on the train heading into Westminster one morning this week and felt I could cry\" wrote Matt Chorley editor of The Times newspaper\\'s Red Box political website. \"Let me tell you which people in politics I can\\'t stand: everyone. \"Nobody has said anything new interesting or remotely helpful in these debates for about two years. \"It\\'s all so bloody depressing. I hate them all.\" Even the government is not immune. \"This could be all over in two months and we could see our families again\" one government source said Thursday. The \"constitutional crisis\" as the government\\'s chief legal advisor describes it stems from May\\'s lack of a parliamentary majority. She is therefore at the mercy of the various factions within her centre-right party divided between eurosceptics and europhiles and of the right-wing Northern Irish allies that the Conservatives rely upon for support. After a meeting of the party\\'s 1922 Committee of backbenchers one Conservative MP told AFP: \"There\\'s no confidence no leadership - it\\'s a mess\". \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit deal was headed for defeat in a historic vote in parliament Tuesday pitching Britain into the unknown just 17 days before it is scheduled to leave the European Union. Parliament\\'s failure to back the divorce terms could unleash economic chaos: it raises the risk of Britain severing ties with its biggest trade partner on March 29 without a deal after 46 years of EU membership. May had dashed off to Strasbourg on Monday to wrest concessions from EU leaders in a last-gasp bid to win parliament\\'s blessing in one of its most consequential votes in generations. The British leader announced that she had secured the \"legally binding changes\" to the vexing issue of the Irish border that lawmakers had long sought. But Attorney General Geoffrey Cox who provides the government with independent legal advice said the risk in the most contentious points of the 585-page withdrawal deal agreed with the EU \"remains unchanged\". May\\'s initial deal with Brussels on unwinding Britain\\'s EU membership suffered an overwhelming defeat at the hands of MPs in January with anti-Brexit MPs and hardliners forming an unlikely alliance.\\xa0Parliament\\'s failure to back the divorce terms could unleash economic chaos The European Research Group of Brexit hardliners in May\\'s Conservative Party and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which gives May her working majority in parliament both came out against the deal on Tuesday. The main opposition Labour Party also opposes it. The pound reversed the gains it had made after May\\'s announcement on Monday and tumbled after Cox\\'s advice was released. \\'Nothing has really changed\\' The so-called \"backstop\" solution for the Irish border - designed to avert sectarian violence from returning to Britain\\'s Northern Ireland - is opposed by more ardent Brexit supporters. They pressed May to secure the right for Britain to pull out of the arrangement or to make it time limited.\\xa0 But Brussels has called it essential for preserving the bloc\\'s external border after Brexit. The DUP said in a statement that \"sufficient progress has not been achieved at this time\" and called for a \"sensible deal\". The DUP\\'s consent was seen as vital for swaying members of May\\'s own party to soften their opposition and either back the deal or abstain in the vote. But there was scant evidence of support for May\\'s compromise in Conservative ranks. \"Nothing has really changed and it is still a bad deal so unable to vote for this\" Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns tweeted. \\'Brexit could be lost\\' May warned lawmakers in a desperate last attempt to sway them that \"Brexit could be lost\" if they voted against her Tuesday. \"I think everybody needs to recognise for those who genuinely want to deliver Brexit that actually if this deal does not go through tonight then this house risks no Brexit at all\" May said. Leaders across Europe also united behind a message that this was the best and final offer Britain could expect. \"There will be no third chance\" European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said after his talks on Monday with May. And German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Tuesday that the EU was making \"far-reaching proposals that take into account the concerns of Great Britain and to find answers for them\". No-deal and delay Another defeat would tee up additional votes on the way ahead that May has promised in a bid to preserve unity inside her fractured government. One on Wednesday would decide whether Britain should simply leave on March 29 without any deal at all. That option is fraught with economic dangers and is backed only by hardcore proponents of the divorce. The \"no-deal\" scenario\\'s likely defeat would lead to a vote on Thursday on requesting a delay to Brexit from the EU. The other 27 nations would need to back the extension unanimously and decide how long it should be. Their leaders will meet in Brussels for a summit on March 21-22. But any postponement may have to be short-lived. Juncker on Monday said a delay beyond European Parliament elections at the end of May would mean Britain would have to take part in the polls. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A deal to regulate Britain's exit from the EU was the best way forward the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier insisted on Thursday.He stood by the deal negotiated with Theresa May's government and rejected twice by the House of Commons saying the EU was not seeking to punish the UK. While branding the UK’s decision to leave the EU as a “lose-lose situation” for both sides Mr Barnier said that an orderly withdrawal could only take place with approval of the deal reached following 18 months of negotiations.He pointed out that the March 29 departure deadline was chosen by the UK Prime Minister when article 50 (the withdrawal clause) was activated.Mr Barnier made his remarks when addressing the Committee of Regions' two-day summit being held in Bucharest Romania.This consultative body incorporates regional and local governments across the 28 EU member states. Speaking shortly before the UK Parliament was due to vote on whether to delay Britain’s exit from the bloc Mr Barnier refused to enter into the merits of the matter or dwell on the options ahead saying this was in the remit of EU leaders to decide. “I will continue to exercise patience and calm and remain respectful of the UK its people and its legislative and parliamentary procedure. I will be waiting in this spirit. If the UK wants to leave in an orderly fashion then this treaty is the only one available. We need a constructive and positive vote and not a negative against it” he said.In his address Mr Barnier remarked that there was no added value in Brexit.Nobody has been able to prove to me the added value of Brexit“Nobody has been able to prove to me the added value of Brexit not even Mr Farage (former UKIP leader who led the leave campaign) whom I met various times” he said.Throughout his address the chief EU negotiator insisted he was keen to resolve the current impasse with the House of Commons and start talks on the UK’s future relationship with the EUHe added that the decision of the UK’s parliament to reject the deal twice had made the situation worse and increased uncertainty. Britain he said had “underestimated” the “innumerable” consequence of Brexit.Though the EU regretted this decision it respected it and was obliged to put an agreement on the table to secure an orderly withdrawal he said. On the issue of the backstop Mr Barnier allayed concerns fueled by Brexiteers that the EU wanted to keep the UK permanently in the customs unions.However he said that in the absence of a solution this would be a temporary measure.He added that the border issue was crucial for the EU to safeguard its single market in terms of security food standards imports of fake products and tax evasion.Mr Barnier said he was keen to find a solution on this specific matter as this was also crucial to safeguard the peace and stability brought about in Northern Ireland by the Good Friday agreement.Looking ahead he said that main the lesson learnt from Brexit was that countries were better off sharing the burdens together.“You can still be patriotic” he said.Earlier European Council president Donald Tusk tweeted that he would “appeal to the EU27 to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy and build consensus around it”.On Wednesday the House of Commons approved a non-binding motion whereby it declared itself against a no-deal Brexit.The result was a further blow to beleaguered UK Prime Minister Theresa May as various members of her Cabinet defied the party whip by endorsing the motion.Originally the motion tabled by the government was only meant to rule out a no-deal on March 29 thus leaving this possibility open at a later stage. However this move failed when a number of Conservative MPs backed an amendment meant to remove such option completely from the table. EU leaders will be meeting next week to decide whether to accept the UK’s request to postpone Brexit. While there has been no official pronouncement on the matter so far French President Emanuel Macron has already declared that such demand would only be accepted if it would be justified while reiterating that the Brexit deal which the House of Commons has twice rejected by overwhelming majorities was no longer negotiable. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The number of British citizens applying for Irish passports rose by 22 per cent in 2018 Ireland's foreign office said on Monday more than doubling the total of annual applications since Britain voted to leave the European Union. Almost 100000 eligible Britons sought to hang onto their EU citizenship via a passport from their nearest neighbour this year up from 81000 last year and 46000 in 2015 the year before the Brexit vote led to a sharp rise in applications. Anybody born in the Irish Republic or Northern Ireland or with an Irish parent or grandparent is entitled to an Irish passport - a total of about 6 million British citizens. They are able to hold dual citizenship. Registrations for Irish passports in Northern Ireland whose citizens can hold both an Irish and British passport as the province is part of the United Kingdom rose by 2 per cent in the year to the end of December. With three months left until the UK is due to leave the EU on March 29 the draft divorce deal reached between both sides is floundering ahead of a planned vote in the British parliament next month opening up a range of possibilities from a Brexit without a trade deal to calling it off entirely. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

It was billed by Brexiteers as \"Independence Day\" - until political paralysis prompted a last-ditch delay to Britain\\'s planned departure from the European Union. Now people are set to mark March 29 - the original date for Brexit - in all manner of ways from protests outside parliament to tongue-in-cheek \"leaving\" parties. Nearly three years after the divisive referendum that saw 52% of people back leaving the EU Britain\\'s political institutions are deadlocked on the issue. MPs are due to vote for a third time on an unpopular divorce deal on Friday - the same day Britain was due to leave the bloc at 11pm (2300 GMT) after 46 years. Prime Minister Theresa May kicked off a two-year countdown to exit on March 29 2017 by triggering Article 50 the mechanism in EU law to leave the bloc. She repeated the date time after time in parliament and in speeches around the country stressing that Britain would leave on that day come what may. But after her divorce deal agreed through months of painstaking negotiations with the EU was twice overwhelmingly rejected by MPs May was reluctantly forced to delay Brexit beyond the much-heralded date. That has left this Friday as an opportunity for each side - and those in between - to celebrate rally in frustration or perhaps find a moment for reflection. \\'The end of the world\\' Dismayed eurosceptics will vent their anger at the delay to their dream by massing outside parliament on Friday afternoon - some after completing a two-week 270-mile protest march from northeast England. Small numbers of fiercely pro- and anti-Brexit demonstrators have already been keeping up a constant presence in Westminster in recent months. Ardent Brexiteers want Britain to leave the bloc now without any divorce deal in place falling back on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms. At the other end of the political spectrum europhile London Mayor Sadiq Khan will launch a campaign bus on Friday emblazoned with the slogan \"We are all Londoners\". It will tour neighbourhoods of the capital heavily populated by Europeans highlighting government measures to mitigate the impact of Brexit on them. Once the sun has set and the original 11:00pm departure time for Brexit looms Britons will have the chance to drown their sorrows or revel in renewed optimism about potentially stopping the process. Bars and nightclubs in Remain-dominated London have laid on a host of Brexit-themed parties to celebrate the non-event. A club in Bethnal Green in the capital\\'s east has promised \"bonkers Brexit cabaret\" with appearances by characters including \"Monster May\". \"Fill out your visa applications (get a ticket) or you may be rejected at customs - it is time to party like it is the end of the world because let\\'s be honest - it might be\" organisers warned. \"This party will be taking place on the 29th regardless of the Brexit extension!\" they added. \\'How to disagree well\\' Elsewhere the Church of England has invited parishioners to \"cafe-style meetings\" over the weekend in a bid to forge some unity over that most British of things: a cup of tea. Suitable Bible passages and newly-composed prayers will be chosen under the slogan \"Together\" to prompt the faithful - whatever their views about leaving the EU - to start conversations. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby the spiritual leader of the world\\'s Anglicans said on Twitter on Wednesday that \"reconciliation is... about finding out how to disagree well\". He also encouraged more respect for lawmakers. \"Let us pray for them... for a decision that has widespread support and for a process that brings national agreement\" Welby added. Meanwhile the Museum of London has been eagerly capturing this moment of uniquely heightened political division and drama in its permanent collection of oral histories.

The European Parliament on Thursday approved a law allowing Britons visa-free EU visits even after a \"no deal\" Brexit despite a furious dispute over the status of Gibraltar. The law means British visitors making trips of fewer than 90 days to the Schengen passport-free zone will not need visas even if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal in place. The parliament approved the measure by 502 votes to 81 with 29 abstentions paving the way for millions of British holidaymakers to flock to the beaches of the Mediterranean this summer regardless of the outcome of Brexit. Implementation will depend on Britain granting EU citizens the same rights in return but London has said it will do so and the principle of the law has broad support. But the text of legislation itself triggered a bitter row in Brussels after member states - at Spain\\'s urging - referred in a footnote to the draft to Gibraltar as a \"colony of the British crown\". The United Nations does legally list Gibraltar as a \"non-self-governing territory\" but Britain insists it is part of \"the UK family\" and that its citizens freely voted to remain British. Britain\\'s decision to leave the EU has revived controversy over Spain\\'s long-standing claim on the territory against the backdrop of Spanish elections.

Britain\\'s parliament sought a new Brexit strategy Tuesday after seizing the initiative from Prime Minister Theresa May in a historic vote with the risk of a chaotic \"no-deal\" departure looming. Lawmakers exasperated by Britain\\'s failed efforts to find a way out of the European Union after three years of debates and negotiations voted Monday to give themselves a broader say on what happens next. The motion creates parliamentary time for MPs to come up with their own Brexit proposals as Britain tries to stave off a messy divorce in two weeks. The unprecedented measure passed by a 329-302 margin and saw three junior ministers quit the government to vote against the premier. Richard Harrington said he resigned as business minister because May\\'s approach and the resulting impasse had left Britain with \"a democratic deficit\". Junior foreign minister Alistair Burt also quit saying: \"We have to come to a conclusion for the country\\'s sake\". The Times newspaper said the vote left May \"humiliated\" and bracing for early national polls. The Financial Times agreed that Britain\\'s leader now \"risked losing control of Brexit\". Starting over The measure was backed primarily by pro-EU MPs who want to either reverse Brexit or preserve much closer economic relations with the remaining 27 EU states. But no one is entirely clear about how parliament is going to approach its new role in the week the 46-year UK-EU partnership was scheduled to have to come to an end. EU leaders pushed back Brexit day to April 12 after meeting May in Brussels last week and deciding that Britain still did not know what it wanted to do. One of the co-sponsors of the measure to take over the Brexit process from May Hilary Benn said lawmakers would first probably get a range of options to choose from on Wednesday. \"The first time round it will just be \\'here are the propositions\\' and you vote for as many as you would like\" Benn told BBC radio. \"We may then change the system for next week as we are trying to narrow it down.\" The biggest worry for May is a mooted plan for parliament to then in the following days take an even firmer grip of the Brexit agenda by passing legislation that forces the government\\'s hand. Parliament\\'s initial votes will be non-binding instructions that only carry political weight. May has already signalled that she might ignore them if they contradict her Conservative party\\'s 2017 election platform. It included a vow to take Britain out of the EU customs union and single market -- the two vast organisations that open borders and regulate trade across most of the European continent. But Burt said he resigned precisely because he felt that the \"government should adopt any feasible outcome as its own in order to progress matters\". Rethinking Brexit Parliament is now effectively re-considering how to go about Brexit all over again. Everything is back on the table and May\\'s deal - twice resoundingly rejected by lawmakers this year - is just one of a half-dozen or so approaches that may be up for debate. May herself admitted \"with great regret\" Monday that there was \"still not sufficient support in the House to bring back the deal for a third meaningful vote\". Her efforts to bring onside anti-EU rebels in her own party have been fruitless despite months of talks. But there are some hints that the current political shift could be scaring some of the rebels into line. Brexit hardliner Jacob Rees-Mogg head of the European Research Group of eurosceptics said on Twitter: \"The choice seems to be Mrs May\\'s deal or no Brexit\". But the tiny Northern Irish party that supports her in parliament DUP continues to oppose the agreement and it remains unclear when - or even if - May will bring it back for a vote. If parliament does beat the odds and adopt the deal Britain would leave the EU on May 22.

Updated 12.30pm Prime Minister Theresa May will on Monday press ahead with her bid for a Brexit \"compromise\" with the opposition despite a backlash from her own party as she attempts to prevent Britain crashing out of the European Union this week. Talks with the Labour Party are expected ahead of a crucial EU summit that could see Britain leave the bloc as early as Friday if no further delay is agreed. Emmanuel Macron will meet British Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday one day before an EU summit where she is expected to ask the bloc for another delay to Brexit the French President\\'s office said Monday. The two leaders are scheduled to meet at 6 pm (1600 GMT) with May also travelling to Berlin for talks Tuesday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"The chancellor and the British prime minister will have an exchange of views on Britain\\'s exit from the EU as well as on Wednesday\\'s special summit of the European Council\" said Merkel\\'s spokesman Steffen Seibert. Having failed three times to get her withdrawal deal through parliament May has been locked in talks with Labour to find a modified plan that could command a majority causing anger within her own party. \"It\\'ll mean compromise on both sides but I believe that delivering Brexit is the most important thing for us. \"The longer this takes the greater the risk of the UK never leaving at all. It would mean letting the Brexit the British people voted for slip through our fingers\" she said in a video message released on Sunday.\\xa0Britain\\'s parliament is expected later Monday to approve a bill to force the government to delay Brexit Labour wants a customs union with Brussels something May consistently ruled out as it would prevent Britain striking trade deals with the rest of the world. The talks broke down last week with Corbyn saying \"I\\'m waiting to see the red lines move\". But May warned Sunday that \"we must deliver Brexit and to do so we must agree a deal\". Labour is also facing internal division on the issue with eighty MPs writing to Corbyn urging him to secure a guarantee of a second referendum in any deal. Leading Brexit supporter Boris Johnson the favourite to take over once May leaves said the prime minister\\'s talks with veteran leftist Corbyn were \"so disheartening that you can scarcely believe it\".\\xa0 \"It seems utterly incredible that he has now been invited into Downing Street to negotiate a Brexit deal\" he wrote in his Daily Telegraph column. \"And it is doubly incredible that the government is – so we are told - willing to accede to his terms.\" \\'Utter nonsense\\' May\\'s deal includes the legally-binding terms of Britain\\'s withdrawal and also a political declaration outlining the principles of a future relationship. She has told restive Conservative MPs she will resign before negotiations on future trade ties begin. Labour could seek to lock the agreement into law making it much more difficult for May\\'s successor to change strategy. But Johnson one of several contenders for her job said Britain staying in a customs union \"would make a total and utter nonsense of the referendum result\". \"It would mean that Slovakia or Lithuania – to say nothing of France or Germany - would have more say over UK trade policy than London.\" May is hoping to have a deal to present to European leaders at an emergency summit on Wednesday where she must secure another Brexit extension to prevent Britain leaving the bloc at the end of next week with no accord. She has asked for a delay until June 30 but the decision has to be taken unanimously by Britain and the remaining EU 27 members. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters at a G7 meeting in France on Saturday that it was time for the Brexit crisis to end. \"The British authorities and the British parliament need to understand that (the EU) is not going to be able to constantly exhaust itself with the ups and downs of domestic British politics\" he said. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said it was \"extremely unlikely\" a member would veto another extension and revealed he now favoured a lengthy delay. The country\\'s original March 29 departure date was delayed last month to April 12. Britain\\'s parliament is expected later Monday to approve a bill to force the government to delay Brexit. If passed May will have to bring a motion to parliament on Tuesday pledging to request an extension in Brussels the following day and outlining the length of the planned for delay.

Prime Minister Theresa May battled Tuesday to stop Britain crashing out of the EU this week pleading with France and Germany for a second and more lengthy delay to Brexit. A day ahead of an emergency EU summit that will help decide Britain\\'s fate May met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin and was due later to meet in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron who so far has taken a harder line on the issue. In a possible boost for the embattled British premier an aide to Macron said Paris could be prepared to accept an extension of less than a year. In Germany a source in Merkel\\'s party said she could consider a delay until the start of 2020. After meeting Europe\\'s two most powerful figures May is hoping EU leaders will agree at the emergency summit to postpone Brexit from April 12 to June 30 to give her more time to get her divorce deal through parliament. British MPs have rejected the text and May\\'s government is now in talks with the opposition Labour party to try to find a way through the deadlock. But these discussions are moving slowly and EU negotiator Michel Barnier said May must explain in Brussels what another postponement would achieve. \"The length of the extension must be linked to the purpose -- what it\\'s for -- and that depends on what Mrs May will say to European leaders tomorrow\" he told reporters after a meeting of EU ministers in Luxembourg. Speaking ahead of May\\'s talks in Paris with Macron the aide to the French president said France had \"never been closed to the idea of finding an alternative solution to \\'no deal\\' within certain limits and not at any price\". But asked about the length the aide said a year \"seems too long.\" Britain\\'s Environment Secretary Michael Gove leaves after a Brexit meeting. Delay conditions\\xa0 In a new sign of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday that Britain risks a serious shock if it leaves the EU without an agreement. Belgium meanwhile on Wednesday will host a mini-summit of the EU members most exposed to the dangers of a no-deal Brexit ahead of the main meeting. EU ministers have expressed frustration at the turmoil in London where MPs still cannot agree on how to leave the EU almost three years after the referendum vote for Brexit. \"We are in a very very frustrating situation here\" said Germany\\'s Europe minister Michael Roth as he arrived in Luxembourg. His French counterpart Amelie de Montchalin told reporters that \"we want to understand what the UK needs this extension for\". Britain is requesting only a short delay to avoid having to take part in European Parliament elections next month but EU leaders are expected to offer a longer postponement. EU Council president Donald Tusk\\'s office has floated the idea of a \"flexible\" extension of up to a year with an option for London to leave earlier if it finds a way through but there is no agreement on this. Some in the EU are worried that during a long delay British representatives could disrupt EU budget planning and reforms during indefinite Brexit talks. The Macron aide said the strict conditions on an extension would need to include limits on Britain\\'s influence in the bloc so it was \"present and applying the rules but not taking part in decision making.\" Briefing MPs from her CDU-CSU conservative bloc after she hosted May in Berlin Merkel said the option of a Brexit deadline in early 2020 would be discussed at the EU summit according to the source. Labour talks\\xa0 May is now hoping for more progress with Labour although its leader Jeremy Corbyn said Monday he was still waiting for signs of compromise. \"The problem is that the government doesn\\'t seem to be moving off the original red lines\" he said. His top team was meeting Tuesday with some of May\\'s senior ministers including leading Brexit supporter Michael Gove and her more pro-European finance minister Philip Hammond. Corbyn wants Britain to agree on new customs arrangements with the EU after Brexit and believes these could be included in a text May has already agreed with Brussels setting out the shape of future trade ties. But many of her ministers and MPs are strongly opposed to the idea of closer ties with the bloc saying it would undermine the potential of Brexit.

European leaders were grudgingly preparing to postpone Brexit on Tuesday after Prime Minister Theresa May made last-ditch visits to Paris and Berlin to beg for more time. May asked to be given until June 30 to arrange Britain\\'s orderly departure but EU leaders fear that won\\'t be long enough and are now expected to offer her up to a year. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \"There are times when you need to give time\" EU Council president Donald Tusk tweeted as he issued invitations to an emergency EU summit in Brussels on Wednesday just days before Britain\\'s latest departure date. Summit host Tusk said in his invitation letter that the evidence of recent months gives EU leaders \"little reason to believe\" that British lawmakers will ratify the Brexit withdrawal treaty before May\\'s preferred June 30 departure. \"One possibility would be a flexible extension which would last only as long as necessary and no longer than one year as beyond that date we will need to decide unanimously on some key European projects\" he said. Tusk\\'s suggestion does not bind the other EU leaders to accept the extension plan when they meet on Wednesday but his ideas chimed with what diplomatic sources were suggesting as May made her latest tour of key EU capitals. Some members led by France are sceptical of allowing too long a delay that would see British candidates competing in EU parliamentary elections next month and possibly lead to disruption of future deeper EU reform. But others - notably Germany and Britain\\'s close neighbour Ireland - are more fearful that if May runs out of time then a dramatic \"no deal\" Brexit would do more harm in the long run. \\xa0 On Tuesday after flying to Berlin to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel May visited Paris where an aide to President Emmanuel Macron said France was open to solutions.\\xa0 \"We\\'ve never been closed to the idea of finding an alternative solution to \\'no deal\\' within certain limits and not at any price\" the aide said on condition of anonymity.\\xa0 Discussions in Brussels are to focus on the length of the delay - the French aide said a 12-month extension \"seems too long\" - and arrangements to limit Britain\\'s influence within the EU during this time. \"There would be a transition period for the United Kingdom as an intermediary member which is present and applying the rules but not taking part in decision-making\" the aide said. \"There would need to be clear commitments and then a mechanism for monitoring them.\" EU members are keen to ensure a semi-detached Britain does not seek leverage in Brexit talks by playing a spoiling role on issues such as choosing the next head of the European Commission or setting the next multi-year budget for the EU. Briefing conservative German lawmakers after she hosted May Merkel said the option of a Brexit deadline in early 2020 would be discussed at the EU summit according to a source. Extra time May is hoping the extra time if granted by EU leaders will enable her to finally get a divorce deal through parliament. British MPs have rejected a deal May negotiated with the EU three times but the PM is now in talks with the opposition Labour party to try break the deadlock. These discussions are moving slowly and EU negotiator Michel Barnier said May must explain what another postponement would achieve. \"The length of the extension must be linked to the purpose - what it\\'s for - and that depends on what Mrs May will say to European leaders tomorrow\" he said after meeting EU ministers in Luxembourg. A \"no deal\" - in which Britain crashes out of the EU - is still a possibility.\\xa0 The International Monetary Fund said Tuesday that Britain risks a serious shock if it leaves the EU without an agreement. Delay conditions Ahead of the main EU summit Belgium will host a meeting of the EU members most exposed to the dangers of a no-deal Brexit such as France and the Netherlands. EU ministers no longer hide their irritation at the turmoil in London where MPs cannot agree on how to leave the EU almost three years after the referendum vote for Brexit. \"We are in a very very frustrating situation here\" said Germany\\'s Europe minister Michael Roth as he arrived in Luxembourg. May had requested only a short delay to avoid having to take part in European Parliament elections which begin on May 23 but a long postponement would mean Britain participating. May\\'s chances of ratifying the withdrawal agreement she signed in Brussels in November last year rely on either rebel MPs in her Conservative party and her Northern Irish allies backing her deal at the fourth time of asking - or a compromise with the opposition.

Unlike the Sicilians North Africans or Maltese people up north are known to be organised thorough and on time. Instead the UK is gripped by political chaos trading of insults and contingencies for a no-deal exit. A few years ago there was talk of social disintegration and soldiers in the streets of Athens if Greece defaulted. Now there are plans for British soldiers to milk the cows if there is a no-deal departure. Given all this the list of official EU languages may be the last thing on people’s minds. Still sooner or later a decision will have to be made. Will the English language be ditched once the UK pulls out of the EU?\\xa0 None of the remaining 26 member states claim it as a national language. Ireland and Malta may argue that English is functionally essential for them and should be retained. But neither country has a leg to stand on. Their own native languages are on the list. Changing the rules to let each member state adopt two languages would be a cop-out. Maltese has been one of the EU’s languages since 2004 and that status has funded training and jobs in translating documents into Maltese often to be read by practically no one and in instant stand-up interpretation. But in the wake of the recognition of Maltese as an EU language more could have been done domestically to engage schools businesses and the bureaucracy in the development and active use of civilised communication in Maltese. It is the language at home and it is also the language of the Church Parliament and the courts but it can be more. English can remain an official language in Malta but communication within the EU may have to be in another language. It would not be first linguistic shift in recent Maltese history. Meanwhile conversational Maltese remains a melting pot of grammar-defying Maltese injected with badly Italianised versions of English words and peppered with bursts of incoherent and offensive profanity. In a casual conversation the subject often goes one way the verb goes the other way and there is no object even when the verb is transitive. If the speaker is schooled half of the words may be in English. Some use garbled Maltese to their advantage. I ask a simple question that calls for a yes or a no. I get a four-minute mangled answer and at the end I ask myself: was that a yes or a no? I just give up. Back to the English language. You wouldn’t know it as they squabble their way out of the EU but the British have a knack for punching above their weight. Their language is a good example.\\xa0 The US has played a big role in the spread of English. What is odd is that the Americans do not have an official language – not at the federal level nor in any of the states. Attempts to recognise English as a national or official language is resented especially by the Latino community. But in any case the Americans communicate in English most of the time catapulting it into what is arguably the top position globally. Over here many anglophiles acknowledge the American contribution but they still express distress when confronted with American spelling or heaven-forbid American pronunciation. They also brag about an imperial legacy that has stretched the international reach of the language. But this exaggerates the clout of many former imperial colonies or dominions. The British have a knack for punching above their weight. Their language is a good example Take Australia. Geographically it’s a continent but in terms of population size or economic brawn the Australians are not in the first division. Over and over news from Australia reveals that immigrants are not always welcomed with open arms – a bad setting for population and economic growth. I must add that Australia is not alone especially with the resurgence of far-right nationalism around the world. Immigration is viewed differently in the US. Set aside the recent stirring of anti-immigrant sentiment and tightened policy measures to stop illegal immigration at the southern border. Americans recognise that their country was built by immigrants who have been well integrated in American culture and workplace. At the polls the Democratic Party has reaped most of the multi-generational loyalty of successive waves of immigrants such as the Irish Italian Jewish and more recently Latino voters. Immigration has been essential in the growth of the US economy. And English is the language of this large and wealthy country. Language is lucrative and in the case of the English language the British get a big chunk of the take. When outsiders learn and use your language you’ll also sell them your dictionaries textbooks documentaries and entertainment. They’ll pursue all sorts of diplomas from your educators and they will enrol in your schools. And when foreign students go back home they retain for the rest of their days a soft spot for the land that educated them. Your scholars have the advantage of engaging their global communities in your mother tongue. The same happens to other service providers. Given the sheer size of the US those who speak other languages see the advantage of falling in. Businesses relocate to English-speaking locations. Through these and other channels English has become the language of the financial markets science technology aviation and more. After the British exit the French are not likely to let their big opportunity slip by and they won’t be alone. But among EU institutions the European Central Bank may want to stick to English so as not to cloud its influence on the financial markets and the distinction of its experts. Instruction and communications have improved over the years and English has probably become a little easier to learn than for previous generations. I keep thinking of my own experience. In the mid-1960s when I took the Oxford GCEs at the end of secondary school the fear of flunking the English language exam instilled a pervasive sense of panic among students adding to the neuroses of living even back then in a congested place. It would have made sense if the matriculation exam in physics or Latin or Chaucerian English drove the average teenager down the path of tension panic attacks and nail biting. But why would a simple English exam instil such foreboding? To this day I don’t have an answer but I suspect the exam graders in Oxford were taking their task too seriously. Difficulty does not come just with the written version. Spoken English is worse. It has almost no pronunciation rules and the learner must figure out how each word sounds one word at a time. The only rule that I am familiar with has to do with the pronunciation of the “th” as in third versus turd. I confess that I was not even conscious of the difference until my mid-30s though I had already lived in the US for more than a decade. Just think of the thousands of foreign teenagers who headed home up north after a summer spent here learning English. Did they all get their ‘ths’ right? When you mean third but you keep saying turd you may leave a bad impression. I also recall the name of my very first English textbook the Wild Thyme Reader. Guess what! I’ve since been told that the “th” in thyme is an exception to the rule. It’s pronounced as a clean “t”. Now out of all the words in the dictionary why would anyone pick thyme for the book’s title knowing that the word is an exception to a rule that almost no one follows? Again I have no answer. The challenge of proper pronunciation crops up in odd places. The French head of the IMF was on TV lately talking on the British exit. A couple of times she spoke of deer and I kept asking myself “Why is she talking about venison?” What she meant was dire as in the dire effects of the British exit but she pronounced it the French way. Her outlook does not have to be taken on board. It wouldn’t be the first time the experts get it wrong. The exit may be cataclysmic for the Tories but not for the UK especially because it wouldn’t be in either side’s interest. British vigour and quaintness will not take long to recover and blossom and their dictionary sales will remain brisk. But that topic is for another day.

Updated with initial reactions -  British MPs overwhelmingly rejected Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit deal for a second time on Tuesday pitching Britain into the unknown just 17 days before it is due to split from the European Union. The House of Commons voted by 391 to 242 to reject the divorce deal even after May secured further guarantees from Brussels over its most controversial elements. After the vote Mrs May said she was profoundly disappointed but she remained committed to delivering Brexit in an orderly manner.\\xa0 EU Council President Donald Tusk regretted the outcome. \"On the EU side we\\'ve done all that\\'s possible to reach an agreement. It\\'s difficult to see what more we can do. If there\\'s a solution to the current impasse it can only be found in London. Today\\'s vote has significantly increased the likelihood of no-deal Brexit\" he said. On Wednesday MPs will vote on whether or not to take no-deal off the table. If it is taken off the table they will vote on Thursday on seeking an extension of the Brexit March 29 deadline.\\xa0 A spokeswoman for European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that should there be a UK reasoned request for an extension the EU27 would stand ready to consider it and decide by unanimity. Tuesday\\'s vote risks unleashing economic chaos as Britain is scheduled to end ties with its biggest trade partner after 46 years on March 29 no matter what. Appealing to MPs in a voice half-breaking due to a cold May had urged them to avoid the \"economic shock\" of leaving without an agreement. But she also warned eurosceptics many of whom have campaigned to leave the EU for their whole careers that if her deal failed so might Brexit. May has promised to allow MPs to vote on a \"no deal\" option on Wednesday and if that is rejected to decide on Thursday whether to ask the EU to delay Brexit. \"If this vote is not passed tonight if this deal is not passed then Brexit could be lost\" she said before the vote. However eurosceptics believe the deal is so bad it is worth the risk of leaving with no plan. \"We must take what now seems to be the more difficult route but in the end the one that preserves our self-respect\" said former foreign minister Boris Johnson a favourite to succeed May if she steps down. \"It is to leave on March 29 as required by law and to become once again an independent country able to make our own choices.\" - Not a single change -After MPs first rejected the 585-page Brexit deal in January May promised changes to the hated backstop plan which is intended to keep open the border with Ireland.  Weeks of talks failed to make a breakthrough but May made a last-minute trip to Strasbourg to meet EU leaders on the eve of the vote. She announced she had secured the promised \"legally binding changes\" to the backstop which would keep Britain in the EU\\'s customs union if and until a new way was found to avoid frontier checks. But hours later however Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said the additions would not completely allay MPs fears of being trapped in the arrangement forever. It did not take long for Brexit-supporting MPs in May\\'s Conservative party and her allies Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to declare their opposition. Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also urged parliament to vote down May\\'s plan.\\xa0 \"After three months of running down the clock the prime minister has despite very extensive delays achieved not a single change to the withdrawal agreement\" he said. After the vote he said Mrs May\\'s deal was \\'dead\\'. Some eurosceptics changed their mind however urging their colleagues not to risk everything. Former minister Edward Leigh said: \"You may not like the deal it\\'s not perfect but it delivers Brexit and let\\'s go for it.\" The pound which has been highly volatile since the 2016 referendum which saw Britons narrowly vote to leave the EU made gains against the euro after May\\'s deal on Monday but fell sharply on Tuesday as it became increasingly clear the deal would be defeated. - \\'No third chance\\' -The backstop is designed to protect the peace process in Northern Ireland which involved the removal of border checks with EU member Ireland. The EU has done everything it can to help get the Withdrawal Agreement over the line. The impasse can only be solved in the #UK. Our “no-deal” preparations are now more important than ever before. Brexit supporters wanted a unilateral way out of it or a time limit to the arrangement but the EU said this would make it worthless. But leaders across Europe also united behind a message that this was the best and final offer Britain could expect. \"There will be no third chance\" European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said after his talks on Monday with May. If MPs vote against a \"no deal\" exit on Wednesday and want to postpone Brexit the other 27 EU nations would need to agree. Their leaders will meet in Brussels for a summit on March 21-22. But any postponement may have to be short-lived. Juncker on Monday said Brexit \"should be complete before the European elections\" at the end of May. PN: Outcome is not good for Malta In a reaction to the Commons vote the Nationalist Party said this was not goodnews for Malta and it was not good news for Europe or the UK. \"A no-deal Brexit could have lasting effects even on Malta and this is why the Nationalist Party has insisted time and time again in Parliament and outside that the Maltese Government should be fully prepared for such an eventuality\" the party said. It also insisted that the Maltese government should keep the Maltese resident in the UK well informed about their rights and obligations in a no-deal scenario.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s Brexit minister said he wanted a generous settlement for Britons living in the EU and for Europeans in Britain after the country voted to leave the 28-nation bloc but declined to fully guarantee the rights of EU citizens. David Davis who has said Britain should begin the formal process of leaving the EU by triggering Article 50 in early 2017 said that the rights of EU citizens living in Britain should be agreed along with those of Britons in Europe. Brexit minister David Davis says Europeans living in Britain \\'didn\\'t pick this circumstance\\'. Photo: Shutterstock \"I want to see a generous settlement for the people here already because they didn\\'t pick this circumstance\" Davis told Sky News on Sunday. \"We want to do that at the same time as we get a similarly generous settlement for British citizens living in the EU\" he said. Davis said he backed the rights of those living and working in Britain and expected all citizens to be well-protected. However he suggested that there could be limits if there is an increase in immigration from the 27 remaining EU countries before Brexit occurs. \"One way of dealing with it could be saying OK only people arriving before a certain date get this protection\" he said declining to fully guarantee the rights of those already in Britain. Border control was an important theme in the June 23 referendum in which 52 percent of those who voted backed leaving the European Union however any limitations could be a concern for Britain\\'s largest firms many of which have spoken in favour of free movement. Davis who said his newly created Department for Exiting the European Union currently has 40 staff but will grow to a \"couple of hundred\" said Britain will now be able to negotiate better trade deals and also keep access to the European single market. \"It will keep its access but whether it keeps tariff-free access is the issue and ...that is what we are aiming for\" he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:08  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Most companies based in the eurozone believe a British decision to leave the European Union would hurt the region as it struggles with a sluggish economy and a migration crisis a survey showed yesterday. Seventy-nine per cent of firms based in the eurozone said a Brexit would be bad for the area with less than four per cent saying it would have a positive impact according to the report from accountants Grant Thornton. “What’s abundantly clear from our research is that European business leaders overwhelmingly view a Brexit as a negative development for the EU” Francesca Lagerberg a senior tax partner at Grant Thornton said. She said business confidence was strong considering the various potential threats the region faced from low growth high unemployment migration and a potential Brexit. “Any one of these flaring up over the next few months could see that optimism wobble if the economic shocks undermine business leaders’ ability to plan and invest” she added. Most economists expect an exit would deal a blow The survey was based on interviews with more than 2500 senior executives conducted in January and February. The result is in keeping with the view of senior business leaders in Britain who are largely in favour of Britain staying in the EU. Most economists expect an exit would deal a blow to Britain’s economy in both the short and longer term. Microsoft on Tuesday said it was more likely to invest in Britain if it stayed in the EU and the Confederation of British Industry urged firms to speak to their staff about the vote. The Grant Thornton report showed 68 per cent of British-based firms believe Brexit would have a negative impact on Europe. Parts of the eurozone have struggled with a debt crisis in recent years which on the heels of the global financial crisis has stifled growth and left many unemployed. The region is also at odds over how to contain a big flow of migrants to the region. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British politicians called for an end to the harsh criticism of judges who dealt a blow to the government\\'s Brexit preparations with a former attorney general saying the attacks by some fellow lawmakers and newspapers reminded him of fascism. England\\'s High Court ruled on Thursday that the decision to begin Britain\\'s formal divorce talks with the European Union should be taken by parliament not the government. The ruling which could delay Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s plans to start the Brexit negotiations by the end of March was met with fury by some lawmakers and British newspapers. Sajid Javid a member of May\\'s cabinet called the ruling an \"unacceptable\" attempt to \"frustrate the will of the British people\" while The Daily Mail newspaper said the three judges who handed down the ruling were \"enemies of the people\". Other Conservative lawmakers have now pushed back against the criticisms. There is something smacking of the fascist state about them \"There is something smacking of the fascist state about them (the attacks)\" Dominic Grieve a former British attorney general was quoted as saying in The Times\\xa0on Saturday. \"It shows either a total misunderstanding of the UK constitution which such critics periodically extol - or a deliberate desire to destroy it.\" Bob Neill the Conservative chairman of parliament\\'s justice committee warned the attacks were \"threatening the independence of our judiciary\" and had \"no place in a civilised land\" and he called on May to intervene. A former justice minister under Labour prime minister Tony Blair also called on the government to show it had no quarrel with the judges and had total confidence in them. \"The British public continues to have confidence in the independence and quality of judges. But both are undermined by this Brexit-inspired media vitriol\" Charles Falconer wrote in The Guardian newspaper. May told other EU leaders on Friday she believed the court ruling would be overturned and said she would stick to her Brexit timetable.\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:08  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May cleared the final hurdle standing between her and the start of Brexit negotiations tonight after parliament passed legislation giving her the power to start the EU exit process. Members of the lower house of parliament voted to throw out changes to the bill made by the upper house earlier this month after the government argued it needed freedom to operate without restriction to get a good deal. Despite an attempt by the Liberal Democrats in the unelected upper chamber the House of Lords to re-introduce the conditions the Lords also went on to approve the legislation unamended late this evening. \"We are now on the threshold of the most important negotiation for our country in a generation\" Brexit minister David Davis said in a statement. \"So we will trigger Article 50 by the end of this month as planned and deliver an outcome that works in the interests of the whole of the UK.\" The bill will now be sent to the queen for symbolic approval which could be granted as early as Tuesday morning leaving May ready to start a two-year negotiation period as set out in Article 50 of the EU\\'s Lisbon Treaty. May\\'s spokesman hinted on Tuesday however that she might do so closer to the end of the month. Her task in negotiating Britain\\'s EU exit was complicated on Monday by Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon demanding a new independence referendum to be held in late 2018 or early 2019 once the Brexit terms are clearer. In recent weeks the government had lost two key votes in the House of Lords which added conditions to the bill to demand that May guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in Britain and give lawmakers more powers to reject the final terms she reaches with the EU. But May succeeded in warding off a potential rebellion from a handful of pro-EU Conservatives in the lower chamber the House of Commons where May only has a slim majority. The Commons voted by 335 to 287 to reject the condition on EU nationals\\' rights and by 331 to 286 to reject the condition giving parliament a greater say on the final deal. Earlier May\\'s spokesman said parliament would be involved in the Brexit process. \"We are determined parliament will be engaged all the way through the process and afterwards\" he told reporters. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Brexit negotiations will resume in Brussels with the UK hoping to achieve progress in order for trade talks to be given the green light before Christmas. Officials from both sides will meet for a sixth round of talks with the European Union\\'s chief negotiator Michel Barnier warning that \"more progress\" is needed on the first phase of the process. The UK hopes that sufficient progress will have been made on the withdrawal issues - including the major stumbling block of the financial settlement with Brussels - to allow European leaders to agree to move on to the next stage of the process covering trade and a transitional deal in December. Brexit Secretary David Davis and Mr Barnier will meet on Friday with talks being conducted by their officials on Thursday. Ahead of the talks Mr Davis has visited European capitals in an attempt to build support for the UK\\'s position ahead of the gathering of EU leaders on December 14-15. In Poland on Tuesday he said the \"historic and deep relationship\" between the two countries would continue after leaving the European Union. \"We are approaching the discussions in a spirit of goodwill and at the December European Council we hope to rely on the support of our friends in Poland in progressing discussions to the next stage\" he said. Mr Davis visited Rome on Monday to say that ties with Italy would \"go from strength to strength\" after Brexit. In the run-up to the latest round of talks the Government has also published updated proposals on how the rights of EU citizens in the UK will be protected. EU citizens will be granted a statutory right of appeal if their application to stay in the UK after Brexit is rejected the Government announced. Prime Minister Theresa May said the UK and EU were \"in touching distance of an agreement\" but representatives of the estimated three million EU citizens living in the UK said that the revised proposals still left them in the position of \"bargaining chips\" as they are dependent on a deal being reached and have no guaranteed right to remain if talks break down. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:08  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The relocation of financial services operators from London as a result of Brexit could boost Malta’s GDP particularly in 2019 according to the Autumn Economic Forecast published today by the European Commission. The EU projected that Malta's real GDP growth is forecast to be 5.6% this year 4.9% next year and 4.1% in 2019 it said. The Commission also said that growth in the near term could be boosted by a faster realisation of planned infrastructure projects. The forecast said that the influx of foreign workers was strongly boosting supply of labour which was why the very low unemployment rate was not driving up wages. However it warned that as the increase in labour supply moderated wages would go up and that these would rise than the eurozone average in spite of productivity gains. The larger population growing disposable income improved consumer confidence and resulting lower savings rate were all driving private consumption seen as the main driver of growth. On the other hand the bonanza from the citizenship scheme would eventually taper off slowing down revenue growth. The Commission said that assuming there were no policy changes the government would be able to record a Budget surplus of 0.5 per cent of GDP in 2018 and 2019 down from 0.9 per cent in 2017 “Risks to the fiscal outlook are balanced as higher current expenditure and related slippages in budgetary execution could be compensated by higher proceeds from the citizenship programme” it concluded. Malta welcomes EU\\xa0projections Addressing a press conference Finance Minister Edward Scicluna welcomed the findings which he said corresponded with government’s own forecasts. The European forecast he said showed that the current surplus was sustainable and the overall strength of the economy. He also highlighted the fact that the ‘Brexit effect’ was forecast to be positive for Malta which he attributed to Malta’s close relations with Britain. The island he said was in a position to offer itself as a ‘co-location’ base in the EU for UK companies after Brexit. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Supporters of Britain\\'s exit from the European Union dumped crates of haddock into the River Thames on Wednesday to protest against Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit transition deal which they say has betrayed the fishing industry. As part of the transition deal announced on Monday Britain agreed to remain within the EU\\'s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) for around 20 months after Britain\\'s exit on March 29 2019. In Scotland home to Britain\\'s richest fishing grounds lawmakers from May\\'s Conservative Party have pledged they will not back a final Brexit deal unless Britain leaves the Common Fisheries Policy altogether. Fishermen blame the CFP for policies which they say will render their industry bankrupt. Nigel Farage one of the 2016 pro-Brexit campaign\\'s most influential figures and other campaigners flung crates of haddock into the river as a mark of protest against quotas which they say force them to discard edible fish. Quotas would force them to discard edible fish \"It\\'s absolutely tragic what a waste\" Farage told reporters as he tipped fish overboard from a small fishing boat on the River Thames outside parliament. \"Nine per cent of the haddock quota is all the UK gets from the European Union. It\\'s dreadful isn\\'t it? It absolutely breaks my heart to see that happening but it\\'s happening on a massive scale all over the country. Can people please wake up?\" The protestors travelled down the Thames to parliament in a small fishing boat flying British flags. Jacob Rees-Mogg a Conservative lawmaker who is a staunch defender of Brexit drew crowds of reporters to a pier in central London to watch the boat pass and express his concern at the impact the transitional deal could have on fishing communities. \"It\\'s not about rocking the boat it\\'s about standing up for important communities across the country\" he told reporters when asked if he was worried that he would upset May\\'s government with the protest. He said he disagreed with throwing fish into the river but called the transitional deal a mistake albeit a temporary one. \"The transition deal is not a good deal but that if it leads to a proper end state it is something that many people can live with reluctantly\" he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:08  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

New Zealand-born billionaire Christopher Chandler is behind Legatum the London based think-tank that emerged as one of the most vocal advocates for Britain’s departure from the single market and the customs union. The names of Mr Chandler as well as Legatum\\'s chief executive Mark Stoleson and several of his family members appear on a list of individuals who became naturalised citizens of Malta in 2016 FT reported. Legatum Institute Foundation\\'s charitable status has come under scrutiny following concerns over its “hard” Brexit stance and access to politicians. According to 2016 figures Legatum Foundation Limited the charitable arm of Legatum Group provided millions in funding to the think-tank which hired several Eurosceptics including Matthew Elliott a co-founder of Vote Leave. Nationalist MEPs Roberta Metsola said it was \"surreal\" that a Brexit backer had applied for an EU passport. Surreal: One of the most vocal backers of hard #Brexit has suddenly become an EU citizen of #Malta...https://t.co/sKzZ1UgYWi MEP Francis Zammit Dimech said the names emanating from the passport scheme confirmed the Opposition\\'s concerns. Since it was set up in 2014 Malta\\'s citizenship by investment programme has become a gateway for wealthy foreign investors to secure the benefits of an EU passport including the right to work live and reside in EU member states. The list includes other prominent recipients such as Boris Mints the Russian billionaire owner of investment company O1 Group and Arkady Volozh the founder of Yandex Russia’s biggest search engine. Members of the European Parliament\\xa0called for the scheme to be scrapped amid concerns that it would turn citizenship into a “tradable commodity”. Individuals can obtain Maltese passports in return for a €650000 contribution to the national development fund and the purchase or lease of property as well as well as investments of at least €150000 in stocks and bonds. Names revealed by the media confirm concerns raised by the opposition in #Malta and MEPs who visited Malta who made specific recommendations on the IIP. It also explains all the secrecy from disclosing names by the government and the need for full transparency. pic.twitter.com/74CK18Nu11 \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:08  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British manufacturers turned up the pressure on the government to abandon one of its post-Brexit customs proposals on Tuesday slamming the idea of a technology-based plan for border checks as naive and a waste of money. Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out Britain staying in a customs union with the EU bloc - to the dismay of many employers groups - and says her government is working on two possible solutions to minimise delays at Britain\\'s ports and airports. But the EEF manufacturers\\' body said it was unrealistic and naive to think a technological border solution known as \"max fac\" or maximum facilitation could be implemented by the time a planned Brexit transition period ends in December 2020. \"It may have some long-term benefits but suggesting max fac is a solution to our immediate problems is a non-starter\" EEF chief executive Stephen Phipson said in a statement.Britain\\'s most senior tax official said such a customs arrangement could cost businesses up to £20 billion a year Phipson said a max fac-style arrangement at the US-Canada border had not eliminated the need for checks on most goods. The customs conundrum - which will define commerce between Britain and its biggest trading partner for decades - is a test of May\\'s leadership as she tries to pacify rival factions in her Conservative Party and her cabinet. She also needs to win agreement from Brussels where officials have dismissed both the options being considered. The max fac option is favoured by Erosceptics in May\\'s party who want looser ties with the European Union after Britain leaves the bloc. But last week Britain\\'s most senior tax official said such a customs arrangement could cost businesses up to £20 billion a year. Under the other option Britain would collect tariffs on imports from outside the bloc on the EU\\'s behalf. A senior EU official last week dismissed as \"fantasy\" some of Britain\\'s main demands for Brexit including on the Northern Ireland border. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier urged Britain to stop playing \"hide and seek.\" May\\'s spokesman on Tuesday criticised what he called \"sound bites and negative anonymous briefings\" and called for a more constructive tone to the negotiations. The EEF has previously urged the government to give businesses clarity on what Brexit will look and has warned of possible damage to complex cross-border supply chains. Last week another major employers\\' group the Confederation of British Industry said remaining in a customs union was currently the only workable option for Britain. Finance minister Philip Hammond rejected that view. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Costs for hiring bankers accountants and lawyers from outside Britain will soar after Brexit and threaten London’s standing as a global financial centre unless the immigration system is urgently reformed a report said. The report from TheCityUK which promotes Britain as a financial centre and consultancy EY said that attracting and retaining the best people is a top priority. “Losing this could undermine Britain’s position as the world’s leading financial centre” TheCityUK’s chief executive Miles Celic said in a statement. The financial sector is quick to remind the government that it is Britain’s biggest economic sector raising more than £70 billion annually in taxes. Applying the current immigration system after Brexit will not work Other sectors like health and agriculture are also calling for unhindered access to international hiring after Brexit. The government is mindful that many of those who voted to leave the EU in Britain’s 2016 referendum want tougher controls on immigration. Across Britain 7.5 per cent of banking and related professional staff are European citizens and 4.7 per cent are from non-European countries rising to 16.9 per cent and 11.4 per cent respectively in London where one in four staff in the sector are non-UK citizens. Banks insurers asset managers and the lawyers and accountants that support them can currently hire from across EU states without visas but must use the Tier 2 work visa system for citizens from outside the bloc. If Britain fails to secure a bilateral agreement with the EU on the movement of people the sector will have to use the Tier 2 system for all non-British hires. Applications for certain categories of Tier 2 visas are routinely oversubscribed and rejected due to caps on numbers the report said. The resulting increase in visa applications combined with planned hikes in visa application fees would result in a 300 per cent rise in costs for hiring international staff the report said. “Simply applying the current immigration system for non-European citizens to European citizens after Brexit will not work” Celic said. Britain could adopt some of the report’s recommendations unilaterally though some speakers at Monday’s launch cautioned that this could dent UK leverage in future trade talks. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Matthew Mirabelli  The potential direct adverse implications of a hard Brexit on the Maltese financial system were deemed to be “contained” the Central Bank said. In its 2017 financial stability report the Central Bank said financial institutions still had to be prepared for all eventualities. The pound fell to its lowest level against the dollar and the euro this year on the back of fears of a no-deal hard Brexit. Exposure to the pound and the UK by financial institutions as a share of assets was limited the Central Bank noted. Furthermore sensitivity analysis conducted by the Central Bank indicated that banks were able to withstand a significant deterioration in their UK securities portfolio. It said favourable economic developments continued to preserve the resilience of the financial system with growth in 2017 of 6.6 per cent. In another report containing its 2018-2020 economic projections the Central Bank said consumer prices were likely to edge up to 1.9 per cent by 2020 reflecting a pick-up in domestic wage pressures. READ: Brexit taskforce\\xa0created to attract investment to Malta Government finances were expected to remain in surplus in the coming years while the debt-to-GDP ratio was projected to decline to about 40 per cent by the end of 2020. The general government surplus is expected to drop from 3.9 per cent of GDP in 2017 to one per cent in 2020. The Central Bank attributed this to forecast lower gross savings mainly reflecting an assumed decline in passport sale flows. This year private investment was projected to decrease marginally but is expected to recover in 2019. Residential investment is foreseen to continue growing robustly but at a slower pace when compared to the last few years as the Central Bank said the pace of the population increase was expected to slow down. EDITORIAL: Crunch time for Brexit Export growth could decelerate this year due to weakness in goods exports and lower passport sale flows. On the other hand goods exports were projected to recover in 2019 and 2020 in line with improved foreign demand. Nevertheless the Central Bank noted weaknesses in goods exports was envisaged to persist and hence likely to grow less rapidly than foreign demand. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Tuesday she would struggle until the last possible moment to achieve an orderly Brexit saying the interests of Germany Britain and the EU were at stake. \"I will fight to the last hour of the deadline on March 29 for an orderly exit (of Britain from the European Union)\" she told a conference in Berlin. \"We don\\'t have a lot of time for it but still have a few days.\" Merkel admitted she had been surprised by the bombshell announcement on Monday by House of Commons speaker John Bercow that he could not put Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit plan to another vote in its current form. \"I must confess that I was not familiar with the rules of order of the British parliament from the 17th century\" she said with a wry smile. And she stressed ahead of a crunch EU summit in Brussels Thursday and Friday at which Brexit is to take centre stage that the ball remained in London\\'s court to plot the way forward.\\xa0I was not familiar with the rules of order of the British parliament from the 17th century \"I am as of now unable to say what my position will be on Thursday because it depends on what Theresa May presents what the situation looks like (and) what may still happen in parliament\" she said. Merkel stressed that avoiding Britain crashing out of the EU without an exit deal was in the fundamental interest of all sides. \"We together as the other 27 (EU member states) will react in an adequate manner and the less people play guessing games the easier it will be\" she said. May is still hoping she can get the divorce agreement she struck with the European Union through parliament before March 29 despite MPs having rejected it twice. But weeks of chaotic political deadlock in parliament have already forced May to concede that Brexit must be delayed amid fears of an economic shock if Britain ends its 46-year membership of the EU with no new arrangements in place. She had been hoping to ask EU leaders for only a short delay when they meet at the Brussels summit warning that without a deal any extension would be lengthy. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

European Council president Donald Tusk said Wednesday that EU leaders could approve a short delay to Brexit if British lawmakers finally approve the withdrawal deal they have twice rejected. \"In the light of the consultations I have conducted over the past days I believe a short extension will be possible but it will be conditional on a positive vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons\" he told reporters. \"Even if the hope for a final success may seem frail even illusory and although Brexit fatigue is increasingly visible and justified we cannot give up seeking until the very last moment a positive solution of course without opening up the withdrawal agreement.\" Tusk took to the podium at the European Council on the eve of a summit at which Britain\\'s Prime Minister Theresa May will plead with fellow EU leaders for more time to win domestic support for the divorce plan. He tacitly confirmed that no decision on an extension will be possible this week at the summit since May will have to go home to try to push the deal through the House of Commons. But he had one olive branch. The meeting could he said approve Britain\\'s request that legal assurances on the terms of the withdrawal that were published last week in Strasbourg could be approved by the leaders opening the way for a vote. But he said he had not yet decided whether it will be necessary to hold another emergency summit next week to approve the extended Brexit deadline before Britain\\'s scheduled March 29 departure. \"When it comes to the approval of the Strasbourg agreement I believe that this is possible and in my view does not create risks especially if it were to help the ratification process in the UK\" he said. \"At this time I do not foresee an extraordinary European Council\" he said. \"If the leaders approve my recommendations and there is a positive vote in the House of Commons next week we can finalise and formalise the decision on an extension in a written procedure. \"However if there is such a need I will not hesitate to invite the members of the European Council to Brussels for a meeting next week.\" May\\'s letter to Tusk asked for Brexit day to be delayed until June 30 despite EU warnings that it would be legally difficult to go beyond the May 23 start of European parliamentary elections. Tusk said the date \"has its merits\" but admitted it \"creates a series of questions of a legal and political nature. Leaders will discuss this tomorrow.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:08  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Reuters/Peter Nicholls  Jo Johnson the younger brother of Boris resigned from British Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s government on Friday calling in a withering critique for another referendum to avoid the vassalage or chaos that he said her Brexit plans would unleash. Quitting as a junior transport minister Johnson called May\\'s Brexit plans delusional and said he could not vote for the deal she is expected to unveil in parliament within weeks. \"Britain stands on the brink of the greatest crisis since the Second World War\" said Johnson a former Financial Times journalist who voted to stay in the EU in the 2016 referendum. Johnson 46 called it the worst failure of statecraft since the 1956 Suez canal crisis in which Britain was humiliatingly forced by the United States to withdraw its troops from Egypt. \"To present the nation with a choice between two deeply unattractive outcomes vassalage and chaos is a failure of British statecraft on a scale unseen since the Suez crisis\" he said. \"Given that the reality of Brexit has turned out to be so far from what was once promised the democratic thing to do is to give the public the final say\" he added. Johnson\\'s criticism underscored the travails that May faces in getting any Brexit divorce deal which London and Brussels say is 95 percent done approved by her own fractious party.Britain stands on the brink of the greatest crisis since the Second World War The pound sank to a day\\'s low beneath $1.30 on the resignation and also fell against the euro. It was unclear whether others would follow Johnson out of government. In the June 2016 referendum 17.4 million voters or 51.9 percent backed leaving the EU while 16.1 million or 48.1 percent backed staying. Johnson wants a three-way referendum giving the people a choice between remaining in the EU May\\'s deal and no deal. May\\'s office rejected his call saying Britain would not hold a second referendum on its EU membership \"under any circumstances\". Johnson is the 14th minister to have resigned from government since November last year and the most senior to have called for another referendum in his leaving statement. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Updated 11.50pm British MPs voted against four possible alternative plans for Brexit on Monday after also rejecting the government\\'s deal with the EU three times. Proposed alternatives for retaining much closer economic ties after leaving the European Union holding a second referendum or stopping Brexit to prevent a no-deal departure all failed to win a majority of votes in parliament. The second referendum proposal garnered the most votes in favour - 280 - but was beaten by 292 votes against. The next most voted option was a plan to stay in a permanent customs union with the EU. It won 273 votes but there were 276 votes against raising hopes among its supporters that the idea could be revived. Following the vote the government said the results demonstrated that its plan was the best and hinted that it could be put before parliament once again this week. Parliament \"has once again failed to find a clear majority for any of the options\" Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told MPs after the vote. \"The default legal position is that the UK will leave the EU in just 11 days\\' time\" without a deal he said. Barclay pointed out that the alternative to a no-deal exit on April 12 would be a long extension that would mean having to hold European Parliament elections. \"If the House (of Commons) were to agree a deal this week it may still be possible to avoid European parliamentary elections\" he said. Nick Boles a Conservative MP who had proposed a plan for close ties with the EU after Brexit announced he was leaving the party after the vote. \"I have given everything to an attempt to find a compromise\" an emotional Boles told parliament. \"I accept I have failed. I have failed chiefly because my party refuses to compromise. I regret therefore to announce I can no longer sit for this party\" he said. \\xa0 \\xa0 Facebook\\'s call for global internet regulation sparks debate Mick Jagger to undergo heart surgery: report \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s main opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn on Thursday called for a general election to resolve the current deadlock in parliament over Brexit arguing that he would renegotiate the agreement with Brussels if he came to power. \"If the government cannot pass its most important legislation then there must be a general election at the earliest opportunity\" he said speaking at an electronic components factory in Wakefield in northern England. \"To break the deadlock an election is not only the most practical option it is also the most democratic option. \"It would give the winning party a renewed mandate to negotiate a better deal for Britain and secure support for it in parliament and across the country\" he said. The European Union has ruled out any renegotiation of the deal. The Labour leader has said he will seek a vote of no confidence in the government if parliament as expected next week votes against the Brexit deal that Prime Minister Theresa May has negotiated with EU leaders. If the government lose a no confidence motion there will be a period of 14 days in which parties can seek to find an alternative working majority in parliament and a general election would be called if they fail to do so. The Labour Party has said it will only push for a second referendum on Brexit if it fails to trigger an election. \"We\\'ll keep all options on the table including the option of campaigning for a public vote\" Corbyn said. Wakefield voted by 66 per cent in favour of leaving the EU in the 2016 referendum but its two local Labour MPs Mary Creagh and Yvette Cooper support a second referendum that could allow Britain to stay in. In his speech Corbyn said that Labour would seek to heal Brexit divisions if it came to power arguing that the core problem was a \"failed system rigged against the many to protect the interests of the few\". \"The real solution is to transform Britain to work in the interests of the vast majority by challenging the entrenched power of a privileged elite. That is how we can help to heal the referendum\\'s deep divisions\" he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s economy grew at the slowest pace in six years in 2018 with near-flat output in the final quarter data showed Monday as Brexit uncertainty and weaker global growth bites. Gross domestic product growth stood at 1.4 per cent last year down from 1.8 per cent in 2017 while growth was only 0.2 per cent in the last three months of 2018 the Office for National Statistics said in a statement. \"Following a pickup in activity over the summer months - in part due to warm weather and the World Cup - real GDP growth slowed markedly in the final quarter of 2018 with GDP falling by 0.4 per cent in the month of December\" the ONS said.\\xa0 \"Construction production and services output fell in the month the first time that there has been such a broad-based fall in monthly output since September 2012.\" The data comes after the Bank of England last week slashed its forecast for UK growth this year to 1.2 per cent from 1.7 per cent blaming the downgrade on a global economic slowdown and \"the fog of Brexit\". It also comes as the British government is seeking to win more time to secure EU concessions on Brexit that could pass parliament and avert a chaotic split from the bloc on March 29. Businesses and governments are on edge as Britain is just weeks away from its scheduled departure from the European project after 46 years and still has no firm arrangements in place. The Bank of England last week stressed that Britain\\'s economic output was also being dragged down by a global slowdown with growth dampening in China the United States and eurozone. The point was echoed by analysts reacting to Monday\\'s data. \"Brexit uncertainty is certainly not helping matters on the economic front but it is probably only a secondary factor in this slowdown with the primary cause being a drop in overall\\xa0global activity\" noted David Cheetham chief market analyst at XTB trading group. \"The eurozone in particular has been especially weak on the data front of late and the focus now is very much on whether there can be a tangible breakthrough on the trade front between the US and China with Beijing back after their New Year\\'s holiday.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A British departure from the European Union without a deal could put 600000 jobs around the world at risk with Germany the hardest hit a study published Monday found. Researchers at the IWH institute in Halle eastern Germany examined what would happen if UK imports from the remaining EU fell 25 per cent after Brexit. They reckoned that some 103000 jobs would be under threat in Europe\\'s largest economy Germany and 50000 in France. Being affected by Brexit would not necessarily mean workers were laid off the economists noted. \"Given the lack of skilled labour in many advanced economies firms could also try to keep staff on by cutting hours or opening new markets\" they said. It is so far uncertain whether Britain will strike a deal with the EU before its legally-binding exit date of March 29 after a huge majority of lawmakers last month voted down Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s painstakingly-negotiated accord with Brussels. A \"hard\" departure without a deal would see tariffs imposed at the border \"tangling up global supply chains\" study co-author Oliver Holtemoeller said in a statement. The economists focused only on trade in goods and services leaving out other possible economic impacts of Brexit like changes to investment flows. They noted that \"since markets are linked up across the globe suppliers based outside the European Union are also affected\" by a no-deal Brexit. Within the 27 remaining EU countries a total of almost 180000 posts at firms directly exporting to the UK would be at risk. But 433000 more workers in the EU and around the world would be affected as their employers sell to companies who in turn export to Britain. For example the study found some 60000 workers in China and 3000 in Japan could lose their jobs. In the UK the study turned up around 12000 jobs dependent on supplying EU firms with inputs for products which are then sold back to Britain. But a study published early last year by research firm Cambridge Econometrics estimated that a total of 500000 British jobs would be at risk if there is no deal. In European powerhouse Germany the vital car industry would be the worst affected with 15000 jobs many of them in Volkswagen company town Wolfsburg and at BMW\\'s factory in Dingolfing. By contrast France\\'s service sector would be the worst hit the IWH study found. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:08  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Ireland faces an \"emergency situation\" if Britain leaves the EU without a deal the country\\'s foreign minister warned Friday as the government published a draft legislation aimed at softening the blow. The law is now expected to be approved by parliament but would not be enacted if Britain leaves with a deal. \"The country potentially faces an emergency situation which we are preparing for now in as comprehensive a way as we can\" Simon Coveney told reporters. \"A disorderly Brexit will be a lose-lose-lose - for the UK for the EU and for Ireland. We cannot offset all of the damage that it will do but we are doing everything that we can\" he said. The so-called \"Brexit omnibus bill\" contains 15 parts intending to limit disruption in provision of healthcare power distribution travel immigration and student financial support between Britain and Ireland. It also contains substantial alterations to taxation arrangements should Britain become a \"third country\" by leaving the trading bloc without a withdrawal deal. \"We are doing all we can to avoid a no deal scenario but we need to be ready in case it does happen\" Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said in a statement. \"This special law enables us to mitigate against some of the worst effects of no deal by protecting citizens\\' rights security and facilitating extra supports for vulnerable businesses and employers.\" The bill does not outline any legislative steps that the Irish government would take relating to its historically troubled land border with the British province of Northern Ireland. If Britain leaves without a deal the 500-kilometre boundary will become a new frontier of the EU theoretically requiring checks and infrastructure to preserve the integrity of the customs union and single market. Coveney has previously said there is no \"secret plan\" for the border but EU Irish and British diplomats alike have confirmed such measures would be necessary. Brexit negotiations are currently stalled. British Prime Minister Theresa May is unable to secure parliamentary approval for the deal she has negotiated with EU leaders which contains a clause intended to keep the Irish border free-flowing. The Irish Brexit bill is expected to pass parliament with minimal opposition before Britain\\'s scheduled departure date for leaving the EU on March 29. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The British government on Friday dismissed as a \"hiccup\" its latest parliamentary defeat over Brexit saying it would keep trying to renegotiate its EU divorce deal just six weeks before exit day. But senior minister Andrea Leadsom the leader of the House of Commons conceded that the setback might affect the ongoing talks with the European Union. \"Yesterday was more of a hiccup than the disaster\" she told BBC radio. She added: \"The one problem with last night\\'s vote is that it allows the EU to continue with this pretence that they don\\'t know what we want. And they do know what we want.\" MPs on Thursday night rejected by 303 votes to 258 a motion expressing support for Prime Minister Theresa May as she seeks changes to the Irish \"backstop\" in her Brexit deal. It was intended to repeat the mandate given to May on January 29 when MPs voted to find \"alternative arrangements\" to keeping the border with Ireland free-flowing after Brexit. But it also took into account another vote on January 29 saying Britain should not leave the EU without a deal. Hardline Brexit supporters in May\\'s Conservative party believe this \"no deal\" scenario should remain an option and so they abstained on Thursday evening. One of those Conservative MPs Steve Baker said the defeat was a \"storm in a teacup\" adding: \"We\\'d like to agree a deal.\" But it comes at a time of mounting frustration in both Brussels and London at May\\'s approach with the clock ticking down to March 29 when Britain is set to leave the EU. On January 15 MPs overwhelmingly rejected the withdrawal deal May had spent almost two years negotiating with the bloc. She now says she wants to reopen the text to change the backstop but has yet to come up with concrete proposals to put to the EU. Brussels has repeatedly said it will not change the backstop although it is open to amending a separate text on future ties. Leadsom said: \"I hope anyone in the EU negotiating team listening this morning will be absolutely clear that the core requirement of parliament that we resolve the issue of the backstop remains the government\\'s negotiating position.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British MPs on Monday passed a new law aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit this week by obliging the government to ask EU leaders for a delay. The law has been rushed through both chambers of parliament over the past week and was opposed by the government which has said it could limit its room for negotiation with the European Union. \"This is a huge dog\\'s dinner\" Andrea Leadsom who represents the government in parliament told MPs. \"I fundamentally object to it on the grounds that it is totally unconventional\" she said. The law was passed on the initiative of MPs subverting the normal order in which parliament debates and passes government-proposed legislation. As a result of the law the government now must put forward a motion in parliament on Tuesday setting out the delay that it will request at an EU summit on Wednesday. MPs will be allowed to vote on this and make their own suggestions as to the length of the delay. It allows the government to seek any extension from May 22 onwards. Prime Minister Theresa May has asked for a delay until June 30 but ultimately this is up to EU leaders and it could be longer. The law does not actually prevent a no-deal Brexit when the deadline for Britain runs out on Friday as that is the legal default if Britain and the EU cannot agree on an extension at the summit. Britain could also choose to stop the entire Brexit process by revoking Article 50 the formal procedure for member states that want to leave. May meets the leaders of Germany and France on Tuesday in a last-gasp bid to keep her country from crashing out of the European Union later this week. Her huddles with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris come on the eve of another tension-packed summit in Brussels focused on the fate of the 46-year-old partnership.

She meets the leaders of Germany and France today in a last-gasp bid to keep her country from crashing out of the European Union later this week.  EU ministers warned Tuesday that Britain must come to this week\\'s emergency summit with a credible plan to justify postponing Brexit as last-ditch talks got underway across European capitals. Britain\\'s Prime Minister Theresa May was to meet her German counterpart Angela Merkel in Berlin and France\\'s President Emmanuel Macron in Paris later in the day before Wednesday\\'s EU summit in Brussels. She will ask for Britain\\'s exit from the union to be postponed beyond midnight on Friday to avoid a chaotic and disorderly divorce and the other 27 EU leaders are expected to agree - under conditions. \"We are in a very very frustrating situation here\" said Germany\\'s minister for European affairs Michael Roth as he and fellow EU officials arrived for Luxembourg talks on the eve of the summit. Roth said that EU leaders would consider May\\'s planned request for Brexit to be pushed back to June 30 but also perhaps for a \"longer one but this must also be subject to very strict criteria.\" Roth\\'s French counterpart Amelie de Montchalin said EU capitals were digesting news from London late Monday that parliament had passed a law insisting that May seek an extension to avoid a \"no deal\" Brexit on Friday. \"We want to understand what the UK needs this extension for and what are the political surroundings around Theresa May to have this extension\" she told reporters. \"And then comes the question of the conditions of what role we\\'d want the UK to play during this extension time\" she said. France and other capitals are worried that if Britain accepts a long delay and even elects a new batch of MEPs its representative could disrupt EU budget planning and reforms during indefinite Brexit talks. Ireland which has much to lose if its larger neighbour quits the block without a deal has been most supportive of an extension but Foreign Minister Simon Coveney also insisted on the need for conditions. \"No deal in my view would be an an extraordinary failure of politics and we need to ensure that that doesn\\'t happen\" he said. \"But of course there needs to be a real plan to go with a request for an extension - that\\'s credible - in order for that extension to be agreed over the next three days and I think that\\'s likely to happen.\" The EU had previously agreed a short extension to the original deadline of March 29.

France is open to the idea of an extension to the Brexit deadline but would push for strict conditions to be attached an aide to French President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday. \"We\\'ve never been closed to the idea of finding an alternative solution to \\'no deal\\' within certain limits and not at any price\" the aide said on condition of anonymity. Macron had previously sought to raise pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by saying an extension at a summit of European leaders starting Wednesday to the current exit date of April 12 was not \"automatic\".\\xa0 The comments raised speculation that Macron might take a tough line at the Brussels meeting which would led to Britain crashing out of the bloc without a deal. Such a scenario exit was \"still a risk\" the aide said but was not \"the favoured option of France.\" The conditions for the extension would be in terms of length - the aide said a year \"seems too long\" - and arrangements to limit Britain\\'s influence within the EU during the extension period. These would limit the power of Britain\\'s commissioner in the European Commission the EU\\'s executive arm and the role of the British prime minister at meetings of EU leaders the aide said. \"There would need to be clear commitments and then a mechanism for monitoring them\" the aide said. \"There would be a transition period for the United Kingdom as an intermediary member which is present and applying the rules but not taking part in decision making\" the aide said. The role of British members of the European parliament for which elections are scheduled on May 26 would be more difficult because under EU treaties they could not be stopped from voting the aide added. In the meantime German Chancellor Angela Merkel views an extension of a Brexit deadline for \"several months to early 2020 as possible\" a source from her party quoted her as telling lawmakers on Tuesday.

European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said Tuesday the European Union can focus unhindered on building its own future now that Britain has a longer delay to work out its troubled exit.\\xa0 Speaking to the European Parliament Juncker also insisted Britain cooperate with the EU during the delay which he did not expect to be renewed after October 31 and be treated as a full member. \"The future of our union is not Brexit\" Juncker the head of the 28-nation EU\\'s executive arm told the parliament in its last session before the May 23-26 elections.\\xa0 \"Brexit cannot and will not hinder our progress\" Juncker said adding the delay agreed at a summit last week will mean Europe will not be forced to discuss Brexit every week. He referred to key decisions ahead on a new multi-year EU budget international trade and the selection of new European leaders including his replacement. Echoing terms of the delay the EU granted Britain at a summit last week Juncker also underlined anew Britain\\'s role in the months or weeks ahead.\\xa0 \"We are requesting there will be a loyal and responsible cooperation\" the former Luxembourg premier said switching to English from a speech in French and German. But Juncker also said Britain must be treated as a full member as long as it stays in the block. \"We don’t have member states of second rank.\" Donald Tusk president of the European Council underlined Juncker\\'s points on Britain\\'s role ahead and said the delay allowed Europe to focus on other priorities like trade with the United States. European leaders agreed with Britain last Thursday to delay Brexit by up to October 31 saving the continent from what could have been a chaotic no-deal departure on April 12. The April 12 deadline was a delay from an original deadline of March 29.\\xa0 The EU granted the delays after Prime Minister Theresa May failed three times to get her parliament to adopt the divorce deal she struck in Brussels in November.\\xa0 The deal also means that if London remains in the EU after May 22 British voters will have to take part in European elections - or crash out on June 1. Juncker underlined the options facing Britain. \"The United Kingdom can also revoke its request to leave but it is not my working hypothesis\" Juncker said. \"Nor is it my working hypothesis that there will be an other extension beyond October 31.\" Notre Dame\\'s historic organ survives blaze - reports UN draft resolution demands immediate Libya ceasefire \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Read the original article. Britain is highly dependent on imported food. By value imports make up more than 90 per cent of the fruit and vegetables consumed in the UK and half of the meat. Brexit is expected to increase trade costs and make food imports more expensive something that could lead to changes in diets and dietary risk factors that influence health. In fact Brexit could lead to up to 5600 diet-related deaths per year by 2027 additional healthcare expenditure of £600m and increase the GDP losses of Brexit by up to 50 per cent. That’s according to estimates my colleague Florian Freund and I have published in a new Oxford Martin School Working Paper. Analysing the potential implications of Brexit is a tricky business. The concrete details of Brexit remain unclear. Proposals range from various forms of “soft Brexit” that include a new trade agreement with the EU to a “hard Brexit” in which the UK falls back on the (higher) tariffs set out by the World Trade Organization.\\xa0This represents an increase in overall mortality of 0.9 per cent in the Hard Brexit scenario We evaluated these opposing ends of the spectrum and compared them to a no-Brexit (“remain”) scenario. We used an agriculture-economic model to simulate the impacts that changes in tariffs and regulatory measures could have on the agricultural sector in the UK. And we used a national disease model to estimate what the resulting dietary changes would mean for mortality from chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease or cancer. Currently so-called “dietary risks” including not eating enough fruits and vegetables or eating too much red and processed meat are the second biggest risk factor for mortality in the UK after tobacco. Our analysis suggests that Brexit could further increase those dietary risks. As a result of increasing trade costs from customs checks new regulation and higher tariffs in the case of a hard Brexit we estimated that prices for most foods would increase. Foods that are critical for good health would be especially affected. Fruit and vegetable consumption could be reduced by up to one portion each per person per week under a hard Brexit and by half a portion each under a soft Brexit. The consumption of nuts and legumes could decrease by up to 7 per cent. Other foods would be affected as well. Dairy consumption could go down by up to one portion per week meat consumption by half a portion and total calorie intake could decrease as well. Some of those changes have health benefits such as reduced intake of red meat or for overweight people reduced calorie intake. But we estimated that those potential benefits would be outweighed several times by the reductions in health-promoting foods. According to our estimates the Brexit-related changes in food consumption could lead to 5600 additional deaths per year under a hard Brexit and to 2700 additional deaths under a soft Brexit. This represents an increase in overall mortality of 0.9 per cent in the Hard Brexit scenario (about 610000 people are projected to die in the UK in 2027) and 0.4 per cent in the Soft Brexit scenario. For premature mortality (before age 70) the increases are slightly higher.\\xa0Healthcare-related expenditure would increase by £600m per year under a hard Brexit Most of the additional deaths would be due to cancer coronary heart disease and stroke which are associated with reduced consumption of fruits vegetables and nuts. The health impacts of Brexit also have economic implications. In our analysis we quantified the economic costs of the additional diet-related deaths by summing up the extra healthcare expense and by using valuation techniques commonly used by government when looking at the costs and benefits of projects that could affect mortality such as new nuclear power plants or roads. Accounting for the costs to healthcare and related services resulted in increases in healthcare-related expenditure of £600m per year under a hard Brexit and of £290m under a soft Brexit. And valuing the changes in mortality using cost-benefit analysis – based on the willingness of society to pay to reduce risks to life – led to costs close to £12 billion under a hard Brexit and £6 billion under a soft Brexit. The Brexit bill for health adds to the impact that leaving the EU is expected to have on other sectors which will also face higher costs of trade and production. We and others have estimated losses in real GDP (a measure of output corrected for inflation) to range from 0.5 per cent for a soft Brexit to 1.4 per cent for a hard Brexit (in nominal terms that would be 1.6-3.6 per cent). The health costs of Brexit amount to 0.3 per cent to 0.6 per cent in terms of real GDP and therefore increase the overall economic losses of Brexit by 40-50 per cent. Given the UK’s import dependence in particular for fruit and vegetables any Brexit-related increase in trade costs will make it harder to get hold of foods that are critical components of healthy diets and chronic-disease prevention. Whatever form Brexit might take our analysis suggests that it will significantly impact the British food system and negatively affect the health and welfare of British citizens.

Photo: Reuters/Peter Nicholls  The European Commission added to mounting confidence in Brussels that it is set for a Brexit deal with London when it scheduled talks with EU lawmakers ahead of a crunch meeting on Monday with Theresa May. However EU officials and diplomats cautioned on Sunday that it was still unclear that a deal would be struck with the British prime minister when she meets the EU executive. Two hours before they sit down for lunch with May in Brussels Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and his Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier will brief Guy Verhofstadt and his European Parliament Brexit team an official said. Verhofstadt and his colleagues wrote to the EU negotiators last week to sound an alarm at what they said were \"stalled\" talks on EU demands that the rights of EU citizens in Britain be guaranteed directly by the European Court of Justice after Britain leaves the European Union. They also voiced concern about Northern Ireland. Parliament must ratify any treaty on Britain\\'s withdrawal from the European Union before Brexit in March 2019 in order to create the smooth transition period May wants and so it will be vital to both sides to keep the legislators on board. Senior EU officials and diplomats said work was continuing on Sunday. One person close to the discussions said the situation was \"delicate\". Verhofstadt a former Belgian prime minister and strong critic of Brexit declined to comment. \"It\\'s still quite fluid\" said a second person who is involved. \"Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.\" READ: Two-thirds of Scots want power transferred to the Scottish parliament The EU wants outline accords on three critical divorce terms before it will open negotiations on the transition and a future free trade pact that would follow. May\\'s lunch on Monday is a deadline for the EU to have her final offers before EU leaders consider whether to agree at a Dec. 15 summit to launch Phase 2. Britain and the EU aim to sign a joint declaration setting out progress toward final deals which the Commission as the EU executive would say was \"sufficient\" for opening trade talks. EU officials say terms have been agreed for a financial settlement long resisted by hardline supporters of Brexit. The Irish prime minister said on Saturday that would essentially cover all the €60 billion the EU had demanded. On the second key issue of a deal to avoid a \"hard border\" on land between Britain and the EU across the island of Ireland diplomats say the joint document will set out rules for reaching a border deal aimed at avoiding disruption to peace in the north but leaving open many of the details. Citizens\\' righs The third issue of citizens\\' rights has long seemed the least problematic but the European Parliament\\'s concerns last week were a reminder of how far the insistence on the ECJ having the final say in whether London was respecting the withdrawal treaty conflicts with British demands to be free of EU courts. It was not immediately clear what compromise if any has been found. EU governments had also been pressing London to give better terms to EU expatriates on bringing in future family members and on moving social welfare benefits across borders. READ: Juncker\\xa0disagrees with Muscat and says Brexit\\xa0will happen One suggestion in Brussels has been to limit clearly any ECJ involvement as a last resort and clearly only available to those EU citizens who choose to go on living in Britain before Brexit not to any who arrive later. There are 3 million of them today. Looking to show sceptical pro-Brexit allies that she has secured something in five months of negotiation that seem set to end with London broadly accepting the EU\\'s original terms May has insisted that Brussels make a simultaneous and reciprocal commitment to transition and trade talks if she accepts a deal. That seems set to be the case with the joint declaration. \"Everyone knows we have to honour politically what the Brits have accepted on money\" a senior EU diplomat said. \"So on Monday they will sign this document.\" If all goes to the plan 27 EU leaders would give the official green light on December 15 a day after May has joined them for a routine summit on other EU business. The deliberately vague concept of \"sufficient progress\" gives the political leaders the option to leave plenty of room for future negotiation. The key thing for many in Brussels is that it should mark the establishment of trust that both sides are willing to work for a separation that is not too disruptive. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Theresa May faced fresh warnings and pressure over the shape and content of the final Brexit deal as crunch Cabinet talks at Chequers loom. With little more than a day to go before senior ministers meet in Buckinghamshire to thrash out a white paper ministers are said to be sceptical about the so-called \"third way\" to solve the customs issue on the Irish border. The proposed \"facilitated customs arrangement\" would see technology used to determine where goods arriving into the UK will ultimately end up. This would allow the correct tariff to be paid - either at the UK or EU rate. According to the Financial Times Brussels will express concern about the reliance of this plan on untested technology and will question how it is not \"an open invitation to smugglers\". Meanwhile Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) warned that a \"bad\" deal on Brexit could cost it £1.2 billion every year. It follows similar warnings in recent weeks from Airbus and BMW who have voiced concerns about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on UK jobs and investment. The Prime Minister is trying to find a compromise that will secure support from both wings of her Cabinet on Friday but critics called for the Government to maintain its red lines on leaving the single market and customs union. A group of more than 40 Eurosceptic Tories met Chief Whip Julian Smith on Wednesday to air their concerns about the prospect of a soft Brexit which would restrict the UK\\'s freedom to diverge from EU rules in future. Ms May heads to Berlin for talks on subjects including Brexit with Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday leaving behind a bitterly divided party and government.Adopting EU tariffs would be \"abandoning the benefit of Brexit\" and \"a really foolish policy\" The intervention from JLR saw it warn of \"an unpredictable future\" for it and its suppliers without \"free and frictionless trade with the EU and unrestricted access to the single market\". Chief executive Ralf Speth said: \"We urgently need greater certainty to continue to invest heavily in the UK and safeguard our suppliers customers and 40000 British-based employees. \"A bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than £1.2 billion profit each year. \"As a result we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile. We have spent around £50 billion in the UK in the past five years with plans for a further £80 billion more in the next five. \"This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.\" The Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Davis had written to Ms May arguing that her new plan to reconcile warring factions over customs arrangements would be rejected out of hand by the EU. In an attempt to address concerns Ms May said at Prime Minister\\'s Questions the government would ensure \"we are out of the customs union that we are out of the single market that we are out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice we are out of the Common Agricultural Policy we are out of the Common Fisheries Policy we bring an end to free movement we take control of our borders we have an independent trade policy\". Her comments came after Jacob Rees-Mogg hit out at reports suggesting the meeting of Cabinet ministers at Chequers would be asked to support close continued alignment on rules for goods and tariffs. \"It\\'s hard to think of a worse idea\" he told the BBC\\'s Daily Politics. Adopting EU tariffs would be \"abandoning the benefit of Brexit\" and \"a really foolish policy\" because it would curtail the UK\\'s ability to strike its own trade deals. Asked if he would be prepared to rebel if the Cabinet\\'s conclusions at Chequers were unacceptable to him Mr Rees-Mogg said: \"If the agreement from the Cabinet is that we will give the EU £39 billion merely on good faith of the EU\\'s negotiating a trade deal I will vote against that. I don\\'t think I can be clearer than that.\" In a sign of the tensions within the Tory ranks one MP said a meeting of the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG) on Tuesday night was the \"angriest\" he had ever been to \"even stretching back to Maastricht\" - referring to the bitter battles fought during John Major\\'s premiership. The subsequent meeting with the Chief Whip was used by the ERG MPs to spell out their demands for the forthcoming White Paper stressing that there must be no watering down of the position set out in the Conservative manifesto. There was also widespread concern among the MPs about the role being played by Olly Robbins the Prime Minister\\'s Europe adviser and the senior official involved in negotiations with Brussels. And there were demands for a greater emphasis to be placed on preparing for a \"no deal\" Brexit. Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns urged Cabinet Brexiteers to stand up for Leave voters - and referred to the jockeying for position to succeed Ms May. In a message on Twitter aimed at Boris Johnson Michael Gove Penny Mordaunt Liam Fox Andrea Leadsom and Chris Grayling she urged them to \"show your steel on Friday\". \"We know some of you want to be the future party leader\" she said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 6th 09:36  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May called on her party on Sunday to unite behind her plan to leave the European Union making a direct appeal to critics by saying their desire for a free trade deal was at the heart of her Brexit proposals. At the start of what is set to be one of the Conservative Party\\'s stormiest annual conferences May\\'s plans were once again attacked by two former ministers with former foreign secretary Boris Johnson calling them \"deranged\". Just six months before Britain is due to leave the EU in the country\\'s biggest shift in foreign and trade policy in more than 40 years the debate over how to leave the bloc is still raging in the centre-right Conservative Party and even in government. May\\'s already fragile leadership was put under further pressure this month when the EU rejected parts of the so-called Chequers plan. But she put a positive spin on those talks saying she was ready to consider the EU\\'s concerns. \"My message to my party is let\\'s come together and get the best deal for Britain\" May told the BBC in the central English city of Birmingham. \"At the heart of the Chequers plan is a free trade deal a free trade area and frictionless trade ... Chequers at the moment is the only plan on the table that delivers on the Brexit vote ... and also delivers for the people of Northern Ireland.\" May has shown little sign of shifting away from her Chequers plan named after her country residence where she hashed out an agreement on Brexit with her ministers in July despite growing criticism that her proposals offer the worst of all worlds. Johnson who quit May\\'s cabinet after Chequers was agreed called her plans \"deranged\" and attacked the prime minister for not believing in Brexit. He and the former Brexit minister David Davis are pushing for a Canada-style free trade deal with the EU - a proposal May says will split Northern Ireland from mainland Britain by making the British province adhere to different customs rules. Greg Clark May\\'s business minister said such a trade deal would also hurt businesses by clogging up international supply chains that are crucial to companies such as car manufacturers. BELIEVER But Johnson was unrepentant keen to portray himself as the defender of a clean break with the EU. \"Unlike the prime minister I fought for this I believe in it I think it\\'s the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is alas not what people were promised in 2016\" Johnson the bookmakers\\' favourite to succeed May told the Sunday Times newspaper. Davis who like Johnson resigned in protest said her plan was \"just wrong\" but he added he thought it was 80-90 percent likely that the government would strike an exit deal with the EU. May\\'s team had hoped the party\\'s conference would give her a platform to renew her pledge to help those people who are \"just about managing\" trying to pull the focus away from Brexit and on to a domestic agenda. But her first announcement - for an additional levy on foreign home buyers - did little to reset the conversation with Sunday dominated again with Brexit a possible leadership campaign and the prospect of an early election. A report by a research group suggested Britain\\'s decision to leave the EU has cost the government 500 million pounds ($650 million) a week wiping out for the moment any future savings from stopping payments to the bloc. Ian Lavery chairman of the opposition Labour Party said the Conservatives were \"clearly too busy fighting amongst themselves and have neither the ideas nor the desire to offer real solutions to the problems they have caused\". Johnson\\'s interview in the Sunday Times was seen by many in the party to be the start of a campaign to unseat May - something that angered some Conservatives who are critical of the former foreign minister. May refused to be drawn on his comments and did not refer to him by name in a lengthy interview with the BBC. But her response was sharp. \"I do believe in Brexit\" she said. \"But crucially I believe in delivering Brexit in a way that respects the vote and delivers on the vote of the British people while also protecting our union protecting jobs and ensuring that we make a success of Brexit for the future.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A television drama starring Sherlock Holmes star Benedict Cumberbatch as the mastermind of the divisive campaign to pull Britain out of the European Union hits UK screens just as lawmakers gather for a momentous Brexit vote. \"Brexit: The Uncivil War\" which airs on Monday dramatises the characters and strategies behind the historic 2016 vote under the tagline: \"Everyone knows who won. But hardly anyone knows how.\" Commissioned in 2017 its creators could hardly have dreamed of a better moment to release the two-hour political drama with Britain at a critical juncture in the Brexit process. Lawmakers will in mid-January finally vote on Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s draft deal with Brussels after she delayed a December vote amid staunch opposition to her plan. With no alternatives on offer and the looming threat of Britain crashing out of the bloc in March without an agreement the stakes could not appear higher for May and the country. Those behind the Channel 4 portrayal see it as an opportune moment for a dramatisation of how it all began. \"I believe that art drama and storytelling has a civic purpose as well as being entertainment\" said the show\\'s writer James Graham at a preview screening on Thursday. \"It can contribute to our understanding of what\\'s happening at the moment in a different way... than journalism or social media.\" \\'The real decision-makers\\' Cumberbatch plays Dominic Cummings a former political adviser to eurosceptic MPs who was the director of Vote Leave the official pro-Brexit group that helped win the referendum despite all the mainstream political parties backing continued EU membership. Little known by the wider public Cummings is credited with playing a decisive role spearheading the campaign particularly through his insistence on a data-driven social media campaign rather than traditional electioneering. The film portrays him as an intense self-described disruptor deploying tactics gleaned from Chinese general Sun Tzu\\'s ancient treatise \"The Art of War\" and who would retreat to an office cleaning cupboard to war-game his Brexit strategy undisturbed. Graham said he chose to spotlight the referendum\\'s strategists because they were \"the real decision-makers\" and yet \"people you\\'ve never really heard of\". \"It became clear to me that (Cummings)... was the most interesting character because he\\'s the agent of change\" he said. \"You always want a protagonist who makes decisions and there are consequences of those decisions.\" The tactics employed by Brexit campaigners have come under intense scrutiny since the referendum particularly the use of misleading slogans and targeted political ads. In July the Electoral Commission watchdog fined Vote Leave for breaking campaign spending rules. Graham said he was eager not to pass judgement on the digital strategies deployed by Brexit supporters as police and official inquiries continue. \"I hope what we\\'re suggesting is not that tech and data is this evil manipulative tool but that it is now the platforms through which we have our political discourse.\" Not a \\'stitch-up The characters colourfully portrayed in the film include Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage two leading Brexit campaigners as well as businessman Arron Banks an influential pro-Leave donor who is under investigation over his finances. Graham\\'s behind-the-scenes account is based on books by Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman and Craig Oliver the head of the Remain campaign. He also interviewed staffers from both camps and managed to win over an initially sceptical Cummings to meet with both him and then Cumberbatch. \"I just had to understandably persuade him it wasn\\'t a stitch-up job\" he said adding that the actor then spent an evening at the Vote Leave director\\'s home eating falafel and talking until dawn. The writer added that he was \"baffled\" by media reports that Cumberbatch was uncomfortable with how sympathetically Cummings is ultimately portrayed in the finished film. \"Anybody who knows anything about acting knows that you can\\'t inhabit a role unless you can empathise with them -- and that was Benedict\\'s chief obsession\" added Graham. With a background in theatre writing the 37-year-old penned last year\\'s hit play \"Ink\" about media mogul Rupert Murdoch\\'s British tabloid The Sun. Graham admitted taking on the divisive issue of Brexit which has exposed deep-seated fault lines in British society was a more \"terrifying\" prospect. \"Rupert Murdoch is nothing compared to Brexit in terms of the emotions it unleashes\" he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 16th 14:04  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

May tore up her steadfast strategy and sought Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\\'s support in a surprise last-minute gesture that could determine the fate of the country and her government. Her divorce deal with the other 27 EU nations has been rejected three times by parliament and patience is wearing thin in Brussels as an April 12 deadline to end Britain\\'s 46-year membership nears with no agreement in sight. The premier said Tuesday she would seek another \"short\" Brexit extension at an EU leaders\\' summit in Brussels on April 10. She crucially added that she was now willing to bend her previous principles and listen to proposals for much closer post-Brexit trade relations with the bloc than most in her Conservative party were ready to accept. Both sides described Wednesday\\'s meeting as preliminary but constructive. \"Today’s talks were constructive with both sides showing flexibility and a commitment to bring the current Brexit uncertainty to a close\" a Downing Street spokesman said. \"We have agreed a programme of work to ensure we deliver for the British people protecting jobs and security.\" A Labour spokesman said the two held \"constructive exploratory discussions about how to break the Brexit deadlock\". Ministerial resignations The British premier\\'s sudden change of tack was received with caution by EU leaders who wish to see the split resolved by the time European Parliament elections roll around at the end of May. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker delivered a nuanced address to the European Parliament in which he vowed to \"personally do everything I can to prevent a disorderly Brexit\". \"If the United Kingdom is in a position to approve the withdrawal agreement with a sustainable majority by 12 April the European Union should be prepared to accept a delay until 22 May\" Juncker said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel likewise vowed to \"fight until the last hour\" to avoid a no-deal outcome. But May\\'s decision to hear out Corbyn\\'s demand to remain in a customs union with the bloc enraged the staunchly pro-Brexit wing of her Conservative party. Junior minister Nigel Adams resigned in protest at her \"grave error\" in judgement. Fellow junior minister Chris Heaton-Harris also said he was quitting his Brexit department post because he thought Britain should have left on the original deadline date of March 29. Yet the most prominent Brexit-backing ministers held their fire as all eyes turned on a flurry of meetings between government and Labour leaders are expected to hold over the coming days. Scotland\\'s First Minister Nicolas Sturgeon - a pro-EU lawmakers who heads the much smaller opposition SNP party - said she hoped \"Labour doesn\\'t sell out here for a bad deal\". \"I would be very wary\" Sturgeon said after her own talks with May. Closer union May\\'s government has previously rejected the customs union idea because it would keep Britain from striking its own trade agreements with giant nations such as China and the United States. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said failure by May and Corbyn to reach a compromise would prompt the two sides to try to come up with mutually-acceptable options that would be put up for a binding parliamentary vote. May hopes to bring an approved deal with her to Brussels so that Britain can leave the bloc the day before the first nations hold their European Parliament votes on May 23. The British pound has moved higher on expectations of the sides managing to avoid a messy breakup in the coming days. But the Bank of England\\'s governor stressed that these risks remained \"alarming high\" in view of no-deal being the default option that could \"happen by accident\" if the latest talks broke down. Parliament was due to vote later Wednesday on a law that would force May to seek an extension should a no-deal seem imminent next week.

Photo: AFP  \\nThe protest drew people from all walks of life. Photo: AFP  Updated at 9pm with details Hundreds of thousands of protesters swamped London on Saturday demanding another referendum on EU membership amid political paralysis over Brexit in one of the country\\'s biggest protests in decades.Protesters hold up a placard during the march. Photo: AFP Organisers estimated around a million opponents of Britain\\'s departure from the European Union joined what they called the \"Put it to the people march\" descending on the capital by road and rail from across the country. Wielding an array of anti-Brexit signs and EU flags people first gathered at Hyde Park before walking the approximately two-mile route to Westminster -- whistling cheering and chanting \"people\\'s vote\". \"It\\'s terrible\" protester Emma Sword told AFP of the current political gridlock. \"We need to revoke Article 50 and if we can\\'t do that then we need the people\\'s vote\" she said referring to the EU legal mechanism Britain invoked for Brexit. At the endpoint of the march outside parliament speakers including Scotland\\'s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon London Mayor Sadiq Khan and opposition Labour deputy leader Tom Watson rallied the crowds through the afternoon. \"We\\'ve seen how the government has ignored our warnings time and time again\" said Khan. \"It\\'s time to say loud and clear: enough is enough.\" #PeoplesVoteMarch organisers say more than a million people joined protests in central London[tap to expand]https://t.co/KI8HvOednR #Brexit pic.twitter.com/SeD8az1Ev8 A host of other political figures also joined the demonstration including Independent Group MPs who quit Britain\\'s two mainstream parties -- the Conservatives and Labour -- earlier this year in protest at their Brexit policies. \"One million marching for Britain\\'s place in Europe -- a worthy fight\" said Chris Leslie one of the breakaway lawmakers. Four generations\\xa0A majority of MPs voted against holding another nationwide poll on the issue earlier this month and it remains a longshot bid by Remainers. But with the protest coming just days after EU leaders granted a delay to Brexit people are increasingly hopeful they could still force a public vote. \"I was too young to vote in the last referendum\" science student Calypso Latham 19 told the BBC. \"It\\'s going to affect my career with research grants so I definitely wanted to come and protest.\" Protesters want a second Brexit referendum. Photo: AFP This week\\'s agreed delay to Brexit which was set for March 29 has prompted Prime Minister Theresa May to make a renewed bid to win MPs\\' backing for her divorce deal. If she succeeds Britain will depart on May 22 under the terms of the withdrawal agreement the prime minister struck with Brussels last year. But if lawmakers defeat the accord again as expected London must outline a new plan or face a no-deal Brexit as early as April 12 -- unless it decides to request another extension and hold European Parliament elections in May. Hosted by the People\\'s Vote pressure group Saturday\\'s protest follows a similar demonstration in October that drew an estimated half a million people.People gathered at Hyde Park and then marched to Westminster. Photo: AFP Organisers have arranged hundreds of coaches and even chartered a train to bring protesters from all corners of the country to the capital. Stephen Goodall a 96-year-old World War II veteran travelled 200 miles (300 kilometres) by train from southwest England alongside four generations of his family including his great-granddaughter. \"I am an old man and the outcome won\\'t affect me -- but it will affect my family and many people that I know for years to come\" he said ahead of the event. \\'Final say\\'\\xa0The prime minister has repeatedly ruled out holding another poll on the issue claiming it would be divisive and renege on promises to honour the 2016 referendum result. Meanwhile the main opposition Labour Party appears divided on the issue. At its 2018 conference it backed holding another poll as a last resort while advocating staying in a customs union with the EU together with close alignment with its single market. Those marching demanded a second Brexit referendum. Photo: AFP But some MPs are fierce advocates of putting it back to the people while others representing Leave-supporting areas in central and northern England are bitterly opposed. In a sign of the splits at least half a dozen Labour shadow ministers are set to join deputy leader Tom Watson at Saturday\\'s march while the party itself asked activists instead to help campaign for local elections due on May 2. Watson said he had now decided to campaign for a referendum \"reluctantly\" and would back May\\'s deal if it was also put to the people. \"It can only begin to bring the country back together again if we all have a final say -- and then live with the result\" he said. \"I trust the people I represent. And only they can sort this mess out.\" Photo: AFP \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 6th 09:36  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Health safety and even some traditional \\'sin stocks\\' have already shown signs of weathering Brexit-related storms in European equity markets over the past week. The flight to safety in the aftermath of last week\\'s Brexit vote is sending investors scurrying back into healthcare and consumer-related stocks that have shielded them from nearly every big market dislocation of the past five years. On Wednesday European healthcare became the first major regional sector to recover all its post-Brexit losses helped largely by the big UK bellwethers. Food and beverage stocks are poised to follow. Stocks such as AstraZeneca PLC Diageo PLC and British American Tobacco PLC are up between 7 percent and 11 percent since last Thursday\\'s close. They have led the broader market\\'s recovery after more than $3 trillion was knocked off the value of global stocks in the two-day selloff that followed Britain\\'s unexpected decision to leave the European Union. The combination of dependable profits dividends and expectations that the weaker pound and euro will spur earnings upgrades for firms that sell mostly to consumers outside the UK and Europe has underpinned their resilience. \"There are three things at work but I think the first is the reach for dollar earnings\" said Eric Moore who runs the Miton Income Fund from London. \"In a world where GDP is probably slowing everywhere irrespective of Brexit there\\'s just more uncertainty\" said Moore adding the relative stability of the so-called defensive sectors whose profits are less reliant on economic growth brightens their appeal. The rally in bluechip healthcare and food and beverage stocks has even pushed the UK\\'s FTSE 100 to less than a percent below its pre-Brexit level. In US dollar terms the index is still more than 10 percent lower. Outside of the UK German real estate has found favour. Shares of Vonovia\\xa0and Deutsche Wohnen are both higher than where they were before last week\\'s vote. Both companies are focussed on residential properties in Germany where low rates have contributed to steady price rises while low vacancy rates have put a floor under rents. Gold mining stocks Rangold Resources and Fresnillo are up more than 20 percent as demand for the precious metal surged. Goldman Sachs which slashed its economic forecasts for the UK and Europe after the vote now expects earnings in 2016 for the Stoxx 600 to contract 5 percent. Still with German 10-year bund yields below zero the US bank says equities offer value compared with other assets. But given worries over the health of European banks and growth Goldman warns against broad-based buying and recommends investors stick with food beverage and tobacco and healthcare shares. \"The attractions of the more defensive or stable parts in equities are clear\" said Goldman strategists in a note to clients. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 6th 09:36  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Safe-haven German Bund yields fell below zero yesterday for the first time and global equity markets slid for a fourth day running on rising worries about a potential British exit from the European Union. Polls and bookmakers’ odds showed a growing chance a Brexit vote will prevail in the June 23 referendum. Britain’s largest tabloid newspaper the Sun also said it was backing a “Leave” vote. The 10-year Bund yield fell as low as minus 0.032 per cent which effectively means investors are paying to lend money to the German government for a full decade. US Treasury yields fell to four-month lows on Brexit fears as investors pared lingering expectations the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in coming months. A two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was set to began yesterday. Fed funds futures show investors see almost no chance of the Fed raising US interest rates today after the dismal US payrolls report for May. Odds have drifted towards zero as polls have shown the increasing likelihood of a Brexit. A Brexit would increase the risk to global growth and further weigh on the euro while strengthening the dollar tightening financial conditions and likely prompting the Fed to reconsider rate hikes said Jeffrey Kleintop chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co Inc in Boston. MSCI’s all-country world stock index fell 1.12 per cent while European shares fell for a fifth straight session. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 1.8 per cent after earlier hitting a fresh three-month low. On Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average fell 114.12 points or 0.64 per cent to 17618.36. The S&P 500 slid 13.88 points or 0.67 per cent to 2065.18 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 31.66 points or 0.65 per cent to 4816.78. Oil prices fell for a fourth straight day swept lower by investor skittishness over Brexit. The referendum overshadowed signs of a return to health for crude markets after the International Energy Agency said the oil market is essentially balanced after two years of surpluses. Brent crude oil futures fell 74 cents to $49.61 a barrel while US crude futures lost 60 cents to $48.28 a barrel. The dollar has risen about 1.5 per cent from its June lows against a basket of currencies spurred by Brexit fears. Volatility in the pound spiked to its highest in at least 20 years rising beyond heights seen when US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed in late 2008. The yen surged to its strongest against the euro in more than three years. The euro was down 1.02 per cent against the yen at 118.76 while the dollar slid 0.29 per cent to 105.93 yen . The dollar trimmed losses against the yen slightly after a strong US retail sales report for May though the data did little to increase the odds of a Fed rate hike in the summer. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Betting odds on a British vote to exit the European Union narrowed today after an opinion poll gave the \"Leave\" camp a double-digit lead over \"Remain.\" The implied probability of a vote to stay in the EU in a June 23 referendum fell to 70 per cent from 78 per cent earlier this week according to odds supplied by bookmaker Betfair. It was responding to the publication of an opinion poll by ORB for The Independent newspaper on Friday showing support for \"Leave\" on 55 percent versus 45 percent for \"Remain\". Financial markets have been paying close attention to bookmakers\\' odds on the referendum especially as opinion pollsters suffered a blow to their credibility when they failed to predict last year\\'s outright election victory for Prime Minster David Cameron\\'s Conservatives. Yesterday\\'s survey showed the biggest lead enjoyed by the so-called Brexit camp since the poll series started a year ago Yesterday\\'s survey showed the biggest lead enjoyed by the so-called Brexit camp since the poll series started a year ago The Independent said. But the official Vote Leave campaign reacted cautiously saying on Twitter: \"We don\\'t believe the ORB online poll our data suggests it\\'s closer to 50-50.\" Bookmaker Ladbrokes said the ORB poll had caused it to shorten its Brexit odds to 9/4 from 11/4 previously. \"We thought the Brexit rally was finished but the leave odds have tumbled again on the back of the eye-catching 10 point poll\" said a Ladbrokes spokesman. Asked about the contradiction between the betting odds and the poll he said the former reflected the weight of money in the market. \"Since we first started taking bets on this 80 percent of the money we\\'ve taken has been for \\'Remain\\'. This is like any other market the money moves the market\" the spokesman said. \"Polling is a snapshot of voter intention at any given point; a betting market is a predictions market.\" Britain\\'s decision on whether to leave the world\\'s largest free-trading area carries far-reaching implications for politics the economy trade defence and migration in Britain and the rest of the EU. The mixed picture from bookmakers and pollsters has heightened market jitters about the outcome with sterling repeatedly reacting to poll results. The pound lost more than half a cent against the dollar soon after the ORB poll was released. Separately on Saturday a group of Britain\\'s most eminent scientists endorsed the campaign for the UK to remain in the EU saying that leaving could damage research. On Friday however billionaire entrepreneur James Dyson came out in favour of Brexit a significant endorsement for the \"Leave\" camp with less than two weeks to go before the vote. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Airlines based in the EU have the right to fly to from and within any country in the bloc thanks to the single aviation market created in the 1990s but Britain now has just two years to renegotiate access or come up with an alternative system. “There is a distinct possibility that there may be no flights between the UK and Europe for a period of time after March 2019” said Ryanair’s chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs. UK-based low-cost carriers especially Luton-based easyJet are among those most affected by Brexit because they typically make more use of the EU rights to fly between other member states and not just to and from the UK. They could lose that right after Brexit. EasyJet said it was close to applying for a licence to set up an operating company within the EU to protect its intra-EU flights. Its headquarters and listing would remain in Britain it added. Jacobs said there was no time to lose to strike an aviation deal between Britain and the EU as airlines need to finalise their 2019 summer schedules in the first half of next year. While British Prime Minister Theresa May has said no Brexit deal – and a return to World Trade Organisation rules – was better than a bad deal aviation is not covered by WTO creating greater uncertainty over what might happen. Since Britain’s June 23 vote to leave the EU easyJet shares are down 35 per cent Wizz Air’s are down 18 per cent Ryanair’s are up four per cent and British Airways owner IAG’s are up 0.7 per cent. Shares in Germany’s Lufthansa meanwhile are up 24 per cent. European airports have also called for a back-up plan saying a return to decades-old traffic rights deals should be avoided. Traffic rights between Germany and Britain could revert back to a bilateral deal from 1955. But while some in the industry want to push aviation to the top of the negotiating list there has been some push back. German aviation association BDL has said it supported the German government view of not allowing any cherry-picking in Brexit talks and Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said he expected France and Germany would not agree to prioritising aviation. “The UK airlines say they want a shortcut. But that’s something Hollande and Merkel won’t do” he said in Frankfurt earlier this week in comments confirmed by the company. Another issue for airlines is ownership structure. Ryanair was 53.6 per cent owned by EU nationals in mid-2016 including 20 per cent ownership by UK nationals meaning that following Brexit it may fall foul of rules stating that EU carriers must be majority-owned by EU investors. However Jacobs said in a recent interview that he did not expect that to be a problem. “If you look at our investor base they are big international investors with offices all over Europe and could transfer the shares. So I think that will be solved” he said. Ryanair sets out in a document to shareholders on its website the actions it can take to limit share ownership by non-EU nationals. In the case of easyJet the 34 per cent shareholding owned by founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou and his family could be classed as Cypriot rather than British in order to meet the requirement to still be classed as an EU airline.

The future of Gibraltar a rocky British enclave on Spain\\'s southern tip is set to be a major point of contention in the exit talks along with issues relating to Britain\\'s access to the EU\\'s single market or future rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britons living in Europe. Rows between Spain and Britain over Gibraltar have held up entire EU deals in the past – including current legislation governing air travel – and Brussels is keen to avoid a new bilateral dispute getting in the way of an orderly Brexit. \"This seems intended to give Spain something so they don\\'t try to hold the whole withdrawal treaty hostage over it\" one senior EU diplomat said in Brussels. According to the EU\\'s draft joint position on the exit talks which the remaining members are due to approve on April 29 \"after the United Kingdom leaves the Union no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom.\" Both sides are seemingly worried that Spain may hold the entire Brexit agreement hostage over the fate of Gibraltar. Photo: Reuters In essence it offers Madrid a special share of power over Gibraltar\\'s fate but only once the territory is no longer an internal EU problem. A spokesman for the Spanish government said Madrid was satisfied with the decision. \"It is what we wanted and what we have said from the beginning... The recognition by the European Union of the legal and political situation that Spain has defended fully satisfies us\" Inigo Mendez de Vigo told a news conference following the weekly cabinet meeting. SHIFTING ATTITUDES Spain which claims sovereignty over \"the Rock\" which it ceded in 1713 has frequently irritated its EU partners with attempts to use EU negotiations to put pressure on Gibraltar. Since Britain\\'s Brexit vote nine months ago however attitudes have shifted significantly EU diplomats say. \"The British didn\\'t give a damn about Gibraltar and they created this situation themselves\" a second senior EU official said. \"No one is going to blame the Spanish for taking advantage.\" Gibraltar rejected the idea of Britain sharing sovereignty with Spain by 99 percent to 1 percent in a 2002 referendum but voted overwhelmingly to remain part of the EU in June\\'s Brexit vote. Both Gibraltar and the British government declined to make any comment on Friday although Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday in her statement to parliament on the triggering of Article 50 that London remained opposed to negotiating any transfer of sovereignty unless the Gibraltar people approved. Gibraltar\\'s border with Spain was closed by former dictator Francisco Franco in 1969 and only reopened in the 1980s. It has said it wanted to negotiate a \"special status\" with the EU after the British exit something Spain signalled it was ready to discuss without abandoning its claims for joint sovereignty over the disputed territory. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The European Commission said on Friday enough progress had been made in Brexit negotiations with Britain to allow a second phase of talks on future relations to begin ending an impasse over the status of the Irish border. The Commission gave its verdict in a statement after intense talks which resulted in British Prime Minister Theresa May taking an early-morning flight to Brussels to announce the deal alongside Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. The Commission\\'s recommendation that sufficient progress has been made will now go to the European Union summit of leaders taking place next week. Britain\\'s Secretary of State for Exiting the EU Davis Britain\\'s PM May EC President Juncker and EU\\'s chief Brexit negotiator Barnier meet at the European Commission in Brussels. \"Prime Minister May has assured me that it has the backing of the UK government. On that basis I believe we have now made the breakthrough we need. Today\\'s result is of course a compromise\" Juncker told a hastily-arranged news conference. May said she expected a formal agreement to be approved at the summit which begins on December 14. \"I also look forward to next week’s European Council meeting where I hope and expect we will be able to get the endorsement of the 27 (member countries) to what is a hard-won agreement in all our interests\" May said. The commission said it was ready to begin work immediately on phase two talks which cover a transitional exit period trade and long-term relations with the bloc. Moving to talks about trade and a Brexit transition is crucial for the future of May\\'s premiership and to keep trade flowing between the world\\'s biggest trading bloc and its sixth- largest national economy after Britain leaves on March 30 2019. May\\'s key parliamentary ally in Northern Ireland gave a cautious endorsement of the new terms four days after 11th-hour objections from Belfast scuppered May\\'s attempt to sign off on an accord over the Irish border during a lunch in Brussels on Monday. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the border agreement meant there was no way Brexit could lead to a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - what will become the only land frontier between Britain and the EU after Brexit. \"Very good outcome for everyone on the island of Ireland - no Hard Border guaranteed!\" Coveney said on Twitter. In the text Britain agreed that should London and Brussels fail to agree a final Brexit deal the United Kingdom will maintain \"full alignment\" with those rules of the internal market and customs union that help to protect north-south cooperation in Ireland. It said in the absence of a trade deal no new barriers would develop between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom unless the devolved government in Northern Ireland agree that distinct arrangements are appropriate. \"In all circumstances the United Kingdom will continue to ensure the same unfettered access for Northern Ireland\\'s businesses to the whole of the United Kingdom internal market\" it said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 6th 09:36  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged the European Union\\'s remaining 27 members to stick together during talks on Britain\\'s exit from the bloc which began yesterday. Merkel also said the talks were important for the future of European integration. Brexit was a setback but election results in the Netherlands and France this year have presented an opportunity for the EU to push ahead she added. \"The risk of the exit negotiations with Britain is that we do not take adequate care of our own future. Let\\'s stay together let\\'s not divide from each other\" she said with reference to the remaining EU 27 and the 19 euro zone countries. \"This is not just about the exit of Britain with which we want to remain friends with which we want to live in a good partnership but it is also about the future of the European Union\" she said at a German industry conference. \"The four freedoms that give us the internal market must not be jeopardised\" she said with reference to the EU\\'s freedoms of movement of goods capital people and services. \"This will be significant at the exit negotiations.\" Merkel said she wanted the talks to be conducted \"in a good spirit\" and that Britain\\'s position would become evident in the coming months. David Davis began negotiations yesterday. Photo: Reuters \"We will of course implement what Britain pitches but in a way that the interests of the 27 member states are safeguarded.\" Martin Schulz the Social Democrat (SPD) chancellor candidate who Merkel will square up against in her bid to win a fourth term in September\\'s election told the same conference: \"The best result of the Brexit negotiations would be - there wouldn\\'t be a Brexit.\" At their first meeting in Brussels on Monday British and EU negotiators agreed on a timetable for the Brexit talks. Both sides stressed their goodwill but acknowledged the task\\'s huge complexity and tight deadline. Almost a year to the day since Britons voted in a referendum to quit the EU the Brexit strategy debate within the UK government has intensified since Prime Minister Theresa May lost her majority in a snap parliamentary election on June 8. She had called the early vote herself saying it was to strengthen her mandate in the Brexit talks. Merkel also said she was open to the idea of a joint finance minister for the euro zone and a common budget for the currency union. \"Of course one can think about a common finance minister if the conditions are in place and if we do not mutualise in the wrong areas\" she said. Germany has resisted the idea of introducing so-called Eurobonds which could allow euro zone countries to issue debt jointly with some benefiting from lower risk premia thanks to Germany\\'s creditworthiness. \"One can indeed consider a European budget if it is clear that structures are really strengthened and this is used to sensible ends\" Merkel added. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 6th 09:36  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

European Union leaders formally adopted on Friday their joint negotiating stance on a future trade relationship with Britain after it leaves the bloc said the chairman of the summit Donald Tusk. That comes together with an offer of a 21-month transition period to help business adapt after Brexit due in March 2019. The coup for British Prime Minister Theresa May comes at the expense of another fudge over how to avoid an Irish border. Both sides say that after Brexit they do not want to go back to border checks between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland - as was the case during decades of violence in the British province. London agreed that its final agreement with the bloc would include an emergency backstop for Ireland Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar highlighted the EU stance that the transition would only become final as part of a broader deal between bloc and London which means they have to settle on all outstanding issues - including the Irish border - first. \"As Ireland we\\'re not under particular time pressure we\\'re not the ones who are leaving so we are not under time pressure in that regard\" Varadkar told reporters. \"Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.\" Under pressure from the EU and determined to get the interim transition deal to ease business concerns about the practical effects of Brexit London agreed that its final agreement with the bloc would include an emergency backstop for Ireland. For the EU that would mean to go on treating Northern Ireland as if it remained inside the bloc\\'s customs union even after the end of transition period at the end of 2020. May who says Britain will also be leaving the EU\\'s single market and the customs union has strongly rejected that. But the two sides agreed some sort of emergency solution will be there to avoid an Irish border if everything else fails. \"If we can have an agreement on the terms backstop or an alternative to the backstop before June that\\'s something we would very much welcome\" Varadkar said. The Brexit schedule assumes the bloc and London would agree on the divorce deal the transition and a framework for their future relationship in the summer so that the 27 EU leaders could endorse it at their summit in October and take back to their national capitals for ratification hopefully early next year and before the Brexit date. The bloc\\'s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the new deal with Britain talks on which are due to start next month \"will have to respect the principles and the identity of the EU and our single market\". \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The pound was engulfed in a heavy selloff on Wednesday skidding to its lowest levels against the dollar and euro in almost a year as markets ramped up bets on Britain leaving the EU without an agreement with Brussels. London-based traders reported a significant increase in investor hedging against a possible freefall in sterling in the event of a \\'no-deal\\' Brexit which could damage the economy by raising trade barriers with the UK\\'s biggest export market. The exodus began after UK trade minister Liam Fox said on Sunday there was up to a 60 per cent chance the country could leave the European Union next March without any new trade deals in place. The currency move has snowballed since. There was no obvious trigger for Wednesday\\'s big moves lower but rather a building sense of investor anxiety as the clock ticks down towards a series of EU-Britain meetings starting in September with no agreement in sight. \"What we are seeing is broad sterling weakness a very aggressive weakening trend\" said Peter Kinsella strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Sterling tumbled against the euro dollar yen and Swiss franc. The slide against the euro the biggest one-day fall since end-May left the pound below 90 pence for the first time in nine months. Three-month sterling implied volatility a gauge of expected swings in a currency surged to its highest since March. The vol as the measure is known was headed for its biggest one-day jump since November. Part of the hedging trade was being driven by companies. \"A lot of companies can\\'t wait for the (Brexit) negotiations outcome in October so of course are trying to hedge against a drop in the pound\" said Christophe Barraud an economist at Paris-based brokerage Market Securities. NO RATES RESCUE Analysts said the pound was also being hit by a growing realisation that after last week\\'s Bank of England\\'s policy meeting UK interest rate increases were likely to be as limited as one a year and contingent on a smooth Brexit. The BoE raised rates from crisis-era lows last week but few investors saw the increase as a vote of confidence in the economy with so much political uncertainty ahead. \"Some are thinking in the market that the BoE raised in order to given them ammunition to cut rates in the face of a \\'no deal\\'\" said Neil Jones head of hedge fund FX sales at Mizuho Bank. \"The next move could be a cut rather than another hike.\" \"BREXIT MESS\" British Prime Minister Theresa May will discuss Brexit with the EU\\'s 27 other leaders at an informal summit in Austria next month and meet with them again in October to try to seal deals on the terms of Britain\\'s withdrawal. \"We remain bearish on the pound in the short term until the Brexit mess is out the way\" said Nomura strategist Jordan Rochester predicting a range of $1.27-$1.28 before September. The pound has fallen 10.6 per cent since mid-April versus the greenback and is down almost 5 per cent year-to-date. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34   \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Londoners fed up with Brexit can vent their rage with a special gym routine that includes high-intensity exercises like pummelling punchbags bearing photographs of some of the main players like Boris Johnson and Jean-Claude Juncker. The 30-minute circuit also features the \"Theresa May Sack Race\" \"Jacob Rees-Logg lifts\" and \"Politico Headslammer\" in which participants slam balls on to pictures of British Prime Minister Theresa May and opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn. There is also a \"Cameron Quitters\\' Corner\" named after May\\'s predecessor David Cameron to take time out. The Brexfit classes are being offered by fitness company Gymbox whose boss Marc Diaper said the theme was chosen by a members\\' poll of their main frustrations with living in the British capital. A gym member punches a boxing bag next to a quote from former Brexit minister David Davis. Fifty two percent of respondents said Brexit followed by rent prices and train delays. \"We thought well what better way to actually release frustration and anger than actually put on a Brexfit class as we\\'ve called it where you can actually punch your most hated politician in the face on a punch bag\" he told Reuters. The course was designed with the help of an anger management expert said fitness instructor Boriss Visokoborskis. \"Members are leaving our classes feeling relieved lighter and they do something good for themselves they work on their body\" he added. Student Ania Jarzabkiewicz 26 originally from Poland said she felt \"amazing\" after the class. \"I have a problem to get my student loan because of Brexit so today I really take out my frustration on this whole situation and I feel really good\" she said. Fitness coach George 25 said his favourite exercises were the sack races and punch bags. In this particular class leading Brexiteer and former Foreign Secretary Johnson bore the brunt of his frustration. \"It\\'d be wrong to punch him in the face in real life so ... doing it on a punch bag there\\'s nothing wrong with that and it\\'s definitely a great way to get your frustration out\" he said. With six months until Britain leaves the EU May has yet to reach a deal on the terms of the divorce and her plan for future trade ties has been rebuffed by both the EU and many in her own Conservative Party. Corbyn said this week that Labour would vote against a Brexit deal based on May\\'s proposals the strongest warning yet to a prime minister whose plan to leave the EU is hanging by a thread. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 6th 09:36  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The British pound sank yesterday to a near three-week low under $1.30 as traders fretted over Brexit on the eve of another critical parliamentary vote for Prime Minister Theresa May. In overnight Asian trade sterling tanked to $1.2949 ‒ the lowest since February 19. It has since bobbed back above the key $1.30 level. The pound also dropped against the euro. Europe’s equity markets meanwhile rose in afternoon deals as investors snapped up bargains after last week’s heavy losses sparked by global economic fears. London’s benchmark FTSE 100 was up 0.2 per cent on the weak pound which boosts share prices of key multinationals whose foreign earnings can be expected to benefit from a weaker currency. “The pound has started the new week a little on the back foot as the markets await what could be a pivotal few days on the Brexit front with these developments remaining the primary driver of the currency for the foreseeable future” said analyst David Cheetham at brokerage XTB. The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told AFP yesterday that negotiations to break a deadlock on a deal are now between May and members of her Parliament. “We held talks over the weekend and the negotiations now are between the government in London and the Parliament in London” Mr Barnier said as he arrived at EU headquarters in Brussels to discuss Brexit with envoys from the other 27 member states. “We are 24-hours away from Ms May’s supposed ‘meaningful’ Brexit vote and the rumour is that (she) could lose this vote by a wider margin than the last one” said Oanda analyst Dean Popplewell. “As expected sterling remains volatile” he warned. “Though the Prime Minister is still valiantly trying to negotiate some last minute changes with the EU she is neither making progress in Brussels nor at home” noted City Index analyst Fiona Cincotta. \"The choice for MPs will be either a hard Brexit or postponing this date and the latter option seems to be gathering more momentum.” World equities had plunged Friday as fears over the global economy were fanned by weak US job creation figures a European Central Bank growth forecast downgrade and data showing Chinese trade slumped last month. The Labor Department said the US economy created just 20000 jobs last month a fraction of what was expected. The newsflow knocked equity markets which have enjoyed a stellar start to the year on hopes that China and the United States will resolve their trade war. Meanwhile shares in Boeing slumped nearly 13 per cent in opening trade after one of the company’s aircraft crashed in Ethiopia over the weekend with China Indonesia and Ethiopia grounding their Boeing 737 MAX jets as a result. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 6th 09:36  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s government redoubled its efforts Thursday to win over the main opposition party in a last-gasp bid to avoid a chaotic exit from the European Union next week. The latest round of talks came after lawmakers tried to safeguard against a doomsday ending to the 46-year partnership by fast-tracking a bill Wednesday night seeking to delay Brexit. May is racing against the clock in a desperate search for votes that could push her ill-loved divorce deal with the other 27 EU leaders through parliament on the fourth attempt. May\\'s spokesman said there would be \"intensive discussions over the course of today\" noting the \"urgency\" of the situation. Britain\\'s latest deadline is April 12 and resistance to May\\'s plan remains passionately strong. But increasingly weary EU leaders - tired of Britain\\'s political drama and eager to focus on Europe\\'s own problems - want to see either a done deal or a new way forward from May before they all meet in Brussels on Wednesday. Her European counterparts will decide whether to grant May\\'s request to push back Brexit until May 22 - the day before nations begin electing a new European Parliament. One alternative is to force her to accept a much longer extension that could give Britain time to rethink Brexit and possibly reverse its decision to leave. The other is to let Britain go without a deal on April 12 in the hope that the economic disruption is short-lived and worth the price of eliminating long-term Brexit uncertainties. \\'Sense of resignation\\' May dramatically ended her courtship of her own party\\'s holdouts and resistant Northern Irish allies by turning to the main opposition Labour Party this week. The premier met Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Wednesday for a reported 100 minutes of talks both sides described as \"cordial\" but inconclusive. The EU\\'s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Thursday welcomed the cross-party effort to resolved the deadlock. \"It\\'s time for decisions\" he tweeted. But May\\'s decision to hear out Corbyn\\'s demands for a closer post-Brexit alliance with the bloc that includes membership in its customs union has enraged Britain\\'s right-wing and seen two junior ministers resign. One senior minister said May had no other choice. \"It\\'s very simple - there\\'s nowhere else to go\" the unnamed cabinet minister told the news website Politico. \"There\\'s a sense of resignation about her that \\'we get this through and I take the flak\\'.\" Pro-European members of May\\'s team also insisted that it was time to compromise on long-standing political beliefs for the benefit of safe resolution of Britain\\'s biggest crisis in decades. \"Both parties have to give something up\" finance minister Philip Hammond\\xa0told ITV. \"There is going to be pain on both sides.\" Competing visions May and Corbyn have competing visions of Britain\\'s place in Europe and neither has shown much willingness to compromise in the past. Corbyn said late Wednesday that he did not see \"as much change as I expected\" from May. The Times newspaper quoted an unnamed government source as saying that May\\'s office thought it more likely than not that the negotiations would fail. May has resisted the customs union idea because it bars Britain from striking its own independent trade agreements with nations such as China and the United States. And Corbyn is under pressure from Labour\\'s pro-EU wing to push for a second referendum that would pit May\\'s final deal against the option of staying in the bloc. Corbyn has shied away from backing another vote\\xa0due in part to his own sceptical view of Brussels. The Labour-backing Mirror newspaper said May and Corbyn would let their teams negotiate Thursday before deciding on whether to meet again face to face Friday.

Britain is set to crash out of the European Union at the end of next week if it has not passed May\\'s withdrawal agreement or found a viable alternative plan. \"This is the only way to deliver the smooth orderly Brexit that we promised\" May said in her letter in which she also reneged on previous pledges to leave without a deal if necessary. The outreach to veteran leftist Corbyn a reviled figure among British Conservatives and right-wingers who label him a Marxist has drawn fury from eurosceptics in her party. Corbyn wants to maintain closer ties with the EU than May through customs union membership and close alignment with the bloc\\'s single market. That is anathema to Brexiteers with lawmaker Mark Francois telling her \"Jeremy Corbyn is not our friend\" and former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith MP accusing the prime minister of \"betrayal\". \"I fear for Brexit it\\'s never going to happen\" he said. Britain\\'s right-wing newspapers joined in. Tabloid The Sun labelled May a \"traitor\" on Thursday while The Times said \"she\\'s like a prisoner on death row getting another two-week reprieve. \"The truth is she is no longer in control of events\" it added. \\'Lost everybody\\' The hemorrhaging within May\\'s government has been steady since the general election of June 2017 which she called but which resulted in her party losing its parliamentary majority. More than 30 ministers have resigned - with two more departing this week in protest at her pivot toward Labour - and the prime minister has been increasingly slow in replacing them. Downing Street on Thursday finally announced six new names for positions that had in some cases been vacant for weeks. \"Not even her cabinet can now look her in the eye\" The Guardian columnist John Grace wrote. \"She has never been loved but there had been grudging respect for her resilience. Now there was just hatred.\" Paul Breen a senior lecturer at the University of Westminster London said May has \"lost everybody\" at this point. But he reserves blame for David Cameron her predecessor as PM who called the referendum on European Union membership in 2016 and then quit when the result went against him and the Conservative Party. \"It\\'s such a contentious issue they should have created some sort of... group of people like lawyers economists business people to look at the different options\" Breen said. Instead in the aftermath of the divisive poll May set out a series of unnegotiable \"red lines\" on key Brexit issues in an apparent bid to please Brexiteers. But when the overall deal failed to satisfy enough of these eurosceptics her hardline stances came back to haunt her. \"She\\'s like a football manager who has lost the dressing room\" said Breen. \"Once that happens that\\'s it you\\'re finished.\" Italy\\'s Salvini vows to turn away German migrant rescue ship with dozens on board NGO rescue ship fears impact of European Parliament elections \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Updated at 2pm British Prime Minister Theresa May filed formal Brexit divorce papers today pitching the United Kingdom into the unknown and triggering years of uncertain negotiations that will test the cohesion of the European Union. Nine months after Britons voted to leave May notified EU Council President Donald Tusk in a letter that the UK is quitting the bloc it joined in 1973. The prime minister an initial opponent of Brexit who won the top job in the political turmoil that followed the referendum vote now has two years to settle the terms of the divorce before it comes into effect in late March 2019. \"The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union\" May told lawmakers in the British parliament: \"This is an historic moment from which there can be no turning back.\" On the eve of Brexit May 60 has one of the toughest jobs of any recent British prime minister: holding Britain together in the face of renewed Scottish independence demands while conducting arduous talks with 27 other EU states on finance trade security and other complex issues. The outcome of the negotiations will shape the future of Britain\\'s $2.6 trillion economy the world\\'s fifth-biggest and determine whether London can keep its place as one of the top two global financial centres. Britain\\'s permanent representative to the European Union Tim Barrow delivers British Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit letter to EU Council President Donald Tusk. Photo: Reuters/Yves Herman For the EU already reeling from successive crises over debt and refugees the loss of Britain is the biggest blow yet to 60 years of efforts to forge European unity in the wake of two devastating world wars. Its leaders say they do not want to punish Britain. But with nationalist anti-EU parties on the rise across Europe they cannot afford to give London generous terms that might encourage other member states to break away. May\\'s notice of the UK\\'s intention to leave the bloc under Article 50 of the EU\\'s Lisbon Treaty was hand-delivered to Tusk in Brussels by Tim Barrow Britain\\'s permanent representative to the EU. Barrow handed the letter to Tusk the EU summit chair and former Polish prime minister in the Council President\\'s offices on the top 11th floor of the new Europa Building. That moment formally set the clock ticking on Britain\\'s two-year exit process. Sterling which has lost 25 cents against the dollar since the June referendum rose almost half a cent on the news of the Brexit trigger reaching highs of $1.2478. May signed the Brexit letter yesterday pictured alone at the cabinet table beneath a clock a British flag and an oil-painting of Britain\\'s first prime minister Robert Walpole. Brexit deal? The Brexit letter was expected to seek to set a positive tone for the talks and recap 12 key points which May set out as her goals in a speech in January EU officials said. Within 48 hours Tusk will send the 27 other states draft negotiating guidelines. He will outline his views in Malta where from Wednesday he will be attending a congress of centre-right leaders. Ambassadors of the 27 will then meet in Brussels to discuss Tusk\\'s draft. European Union leaders will pledge to stand united in \"constructive\" talks with Britain to reduce uncertainty for citizens and businesses a draft document showed. The course of the Brexit talks is uncertain. May has promised to seek the greatest possible access to European markets but said Britain will aim to establish its own free trade deals with countries beyond Europe and impose limits on immigration from the continent. She has acknowledged that those measures would require withdrawing from the EU \\'single market\\' of 500 million people founded on the principles of free movement of goods services capital and people. Her priorities also include leaving the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and securing \"frictionless\" trade with the bloc while ending full membership of the customs union that sets external tariffs for goods imported into the bloc. She wants to negotiate Britain\\'s divorce and the future trading relationship with the EU within the two-year period though EU officials say that will be hard. \"It was you the British who decided to leave not us who wanted you to go\" said one senior EU diplomat. \"The trading relationship is going to be the most difficult bit to solve - I don\\'t see how that will be done in that time frame.\" A huge number of questions remain including whether exporters will keep tariff-free access to the single market and whether British-based banks will still be able to serve continental clients not to mention immigration and the future rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britons living in Europe. One major uncertainty for May is who will be leading France and Germany which both face elections this year. \"It’s bad news for everybody. It’s a wedge pushed into the European project\" French centrist presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron told Europe 1 radio. The pro-EU Macron has struck a firm line on Brexit saying he would ensure Britain gains no undue advantages outside the Union. The Sun Britain\\'s most popular newspaper projected giant messages to Europe including \"Dover and Out\" \"Goodbye\" and \"See EU Later\" onto the white cliffs of Dover facing the continent. In the French media the response was less celebratory. The Libération newspaper led with the headline: \"We miss you already! Or do we...\" over a picture of a guardsman wearing a bearskin hat a traditional symbol of Britain. United Kingdom? Britain\\'s finance minister Philip Hammond said he was confident the country would negotiate a customs arrangement with the EU that would allow for borders to be as frictionless as possible after Brexit. Global banks such as Goldman Sachs are considering moving some staff out of Britain due to Brexit and some major companies and banks could use the Article 50 trigger date to update investors on their plans. Goldman used a voicemail sent by the Wall Street firm\\'s Europe CEO to reassure London-based staff over potential disruption to its business. At home May\\'s United Kingdom is divided and faces strains that could lead to its break-up. In the Brexit referendum England and Wales voted to leave the EU but Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay. Scottish nationalists have demanded an independence referendum that May has refused. In Northern Ireland rival parties are embroiled in a major political crisis and Sinn Fein nationalists are demanding a vote on leaving the UK and uniting with the Republic of Ireland. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Dylan Martinez/Reuters  Britain’s finance industry has given up on efforts to keep full access to the European Union after Brexit and is pushing instead for a more limited trade deal that would potentially exclude some financial products. Banks insurers and asset managers have come to the conclusion there is no realistic chance of maintaining full passporting rights after Brexit that would allow them to sell all their services across the 28-nation bloc from Britain. TheCityUK the country’ most powerful financial lobby group has listed 17 points in a two-page document published yesterday that calls for limited market access for some finance sectors based on a pact in which Britain and the EU would accept each other’s rules. This would keep the door open for cross-border trading of stocks and bonds and sales of certain other products. The future of London as Europe’s financial centre is one of the biggest issues in Brexit talks because it is Britain’s largest export sector and biggest source of corporate tax revenue. There have been estimates that Britain’s finance industry could lose up to £38 billion in revenue in a so-called “hard Brexit” that would restrict its access to the EU single market. TheCityUK proposals mark a shift away from calls for full passporting rights to be maintained for the finance industry after Brexit. “I am confident that this represents in broad shape the key priorities for the industry” TheCityUK chief executive officer Miles Celic told Reuters. “There are a multiple number of documents out there of stuff at significant length. So there was a sense among our membership to filter down what the key asks were into a single place.” For all products a mutual recognition arrangement is needed along with a framework for recognising and enforcing judgments from UK jurisdictions in the EU and vice versa By pushing for a bespoke deal there is a risk that some financial sectors may be excluded from any final settlement. With some bankers expecting no market access for some retail financial products. But TheCityUK document is the first attempt to condense the industry’s priorities after months of conflicting lobbying and comes just two months before Britain plans EU divorce talks. Until now finance organisations have clashed over who should be leading efforts to lobby the government and what their Brexit response should be. After the June vote business leaders begged for Britain to stay inside the single market for example by having a Norway-style deal that would provide full access to Europe’s markets. But EU leaders have repeatedly warned that single market access is defined by the bloc’s four freedoms – free movement of goods capital services and people – and that they cannot be unpicked. Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday she was not interested in Britain keeping “bits” of its EU membership seen by some as a signal that Britain will leave the single market when it leaves the European Union. Britain should seek “access to the widest possible range of financial and related professional products and services” the TheCityUK document says implying some sectors may lose access under any final deal. TheCityUK proposals call for “clear and upfront transitional arrangements” to bridge the gap between leaving the EU and the start of a bespoke deal though they do not specify a timeframe. Three top financiers HSBC chairman Douglas Flint London Stock Exchange CEO Xavier Rolet and Allianz Global Investors vice chair Elizabeth Corley called on Tuesday for transitional arrangements to last two to three years after Brexit. Trade experts have warned that a bespoke trade deal could take far longer. Brexit supporters want a quick break with the bloc. TheCityUK document favours a deal that would build on and go beyond existing so-called equivalence regimes whereby UK financial firms could continue to serve European customers if they complied with rules the EU deems to be equal. It said that for all products a mutual recognition arrangement is needed along with a framework for “recognising and enforcing judgments from UK jurisdictions in the EU and vice versa.” This refers to the derivatives sector where currently swaps contracts negotiated between firms in all EU countries rely on UK court rulings to resolve disputes. TheCityUK document also highlights some positive effects of leaving the EU in a marked shift from the finance industry’s long-held view that staying an EU member would be the preferred option. “There will be opportunities arising from Brexit including from new networks of trade and investment agreements the creation of Sharia-compliant central bank liquidity facilities and FinTech” the document said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  UK Prime Minister Theresa May has dismissed claims she is at loggerheads with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker over her Brexit negotiating strategy as just \"Brussels gossip\". The Prime Minister came under fire following reports Mr Juncker walked out of talks last week in Downing Street saying he was \"10 times more sceptical than before\". Opposition parties warned the UK was heading for a \"disastrous hard Brexit\" after a detailed account in the German press of their dinner suggested Mr Juncker left fearing the negotiations would end in failure. But campaigning in Ormskirk in Lancashire Mrs May brushed off the claims insisting that they were at odds with what the commission had said about the meeting. \"From what I have seen of this account I think it is Brussels gossip\" she said. \"Look at what the European Commission themselves said immediately after the dinner took place which was that the talks had been constructive.\" Downing Street said it did not recognise the latest account which appeared in the German Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper. The Prime Minister nevertheless sought to exploit the report to drive home her message that she - not Jeremy Corbyn - can provide the strong leadership needed to secure the best deal for Britain. \"It also shows that these negotiations are at times going to be tough and in order to get the best deal for Britain we need to ensure that we have got that strong and stable leadership into those negotiations\" she said. \"When it comes June 8 people have a clear choice. Mr Juncker reportedly left a meeting with Mrs May feeling Brexit talks could easily fail. Photo: Reuters \"There will be 27 European countries on one side of the table - who do they want to see standing up for Britain on the other side? Me or Jeremy Corbyn.\" The Labour leader campaigning in Battersea south London warned however that Mrs May\\'s negotiating strategy was unravelling. \"To start negotiations by threatening to walk away with no deal and set up a low tax economy on the shores of Europe is not a very sensible way of approaching people with whom half of our trade is done at the present time\" he said. \"Of course they are going to be difficult (negotiations) but you start from the basis that you want to reach an agreement you start from the basis that you have quite a lot of shared interests and values. \"If you start from that basis and show respect you are more likely to get a good deal. \"But if you start with a megaphone calling people silly names it is not a great start to anything.\" According to the newspaper account - attributed to commission sources - the EU side left the meeting believing Mrs May was way too optimistic about the prospects for a deal. When the Prime Minister told them \"Let us make Brexit a success\" Mr Juncker was said to have replied \"Brexit cannot be a success\". At one stage - to underline the complexity of negotiations - the commission president was said to have brandished copies of Croatia\\'s EU entry deal and Canada\\'s free trade deal which runs to 2000 pages. Mrs May was also said to have angered the EU side when she warned that the UK could not be forced to pay a \"divorce bill\" for leaving because there was no requirement under the treaties which drew the response that the EU was \"not a golf club\". As he left Mr Juncker was said to have told her: \"I leave Downing St 10 times as sceptical as I was before.\" The following morning he rang German chancellor Angela Merkel to warn her that Mrs May\\'s approach was from a \"different galaxy\" and that she was deluding herself. Mrs Merkel responded by re-writing a speech she was giving that day to warn that some in Britain were still harbouring \"illusions\" about the Brexit process. No 10 said it did not recognise the account of the meeting which took place over dinner last Wednesday. A Government spokesman said: \"As the Prime Minister and Jean-Claude Juncker made clear this was a constructive meeting ahead of the negotiations formally getting under way.\" Liberal Democrat Leader Tim Farron said: \"It\\'s clear this Government has no clue and is taking the country towards a disastrous hard Brexit.\" For the SNP Scotland\\'s minister for UK negotiations with the EU Michael Russell said: \"Leaving the EU with no deal - and no agreement on access to the single market - would be an unprecedented act of self-harm which would devastate the UK and Scottish economy.\" However pro-Brexit Conservatives dismissed the report as an attempt to destabilise the Government ahead of the negotiations. Former party leader Iain Duncan Smith told Channel 4 News: \"The reality is there is no trouble because this is all pre-negotiation guff really at the end of the day so it should be put in that basket and then we\\'ll get on with the negotiation.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s government was defeated on Wednesday night when lawmakers forced through changes to its Brexit blueprint that ministers said could endanger Britain\\'s departure from the European Union. In a blow to May already weakened after losing her Conservative Party\\'s majority in a June election the 650-seat parliament voted 309 to 305 in favour of an amendment to hand lawmakers more say over a final exit deal with the EU. Up until the last minute of an often bitter debate in parliament May\\'s team tried to convince lawmakers in her party to give up their demands and side with a government fearful that the move will weaken its hand in tough Brexit negotiations. Members of Parliament (MPs) are debating the EU withdrawal bill which will repeal the 1972 legislation binding Britain to the EU and copy existing EU law into domestic law to ensure legal continuity after \\'Exit Day\\' on March 29 2019. In focus on Wednesday was an amendment put forward by Conservative lawmaker and former attorney general Dominic Grieve who wants parliament to have a meaningful vote on any deal before it is finalised and for it to be written into law. \"There is a time for everybody to stand up and be counted\" Grieve told parliament earlier criticising some fellow members of the Conservative Party for calling him a traitor over his decision to vote against the government. He dismissed a last-minute pledge by justice minister Dominic Raab for government to write the promise of a meaningful vote into law later on its journey through both houses of parliament as coming \"too late\". The government was \"disappointed\" by the vote a spokeswoman said in a statement adding that \"this amendment does not prevent us from preparing our statute book for exit day\". But with May due at an EU summit on Thursday to encourage the other 27 leaders to approve a move to the second phase of Brexit talks and begin a discussion about future trade the defeat comes at a difficult time for the prime minister. In the European Parliament which must also ratify any withdrawal treaty with Britain its Brexit coordinator cheekily tweeted that his British counterparts had \"taken back control\" - a reference to the catchphrase of pro-Brexit campaigners. \"A good day for democracy\" added Guy Verhofstadt. DEEP DIVISIONS The EU withdrawal bill has been the focus of seven days of often bitter debate underscoring the deep divisions over Brexit not only among the Conservatives but also in the main opposition Labour Party and across the country. It has also highlighted May\\'s weakness. In June she gambled on a snap election to strengthen her party\\'s majority in the 650-seat parliament but instead bungled her campaign and ended up with a minority government propped up by the 10 votes of a small pro-Brexit Northern Irish party. Since then she has struggled to assert her authority over a Conservative Party which is deeply divided over the best route out of the EU. \"This defeat is a humiliating loss of authority for the government on the eve of the European Council meeting\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a statement. \"Theresa May has resisted democratic accountability. Her refusal to listen means she will now have to accept Parliament taking back control.\" Earlier May had tried to persuade lawmakers to vote with the government for her Brexit blueprint saying Grieve\\'s amendment would put added time pressure on a government which wants to make Britain ready to leave the EU in March 2019. \"That could be at a very late stage in the proceedings which could mean that we are not able to have the orderly and smooth exit from the European Union that we wish to have\" she told parliament before an hours-long debate on the exit plan. Her spokesman said the government had \"in good faith come forward with a strong package of concessions to deal with the spirit of the amendment\". Pro-Brexit lawmakers fear the amendment could force Britain to weaken its negotiating stance by offering parliament the opportunity of forcing ministers back to the negotiating table if it feels any final deal is not good enough. Raab said that could convince the EU that Britain would not walk away from a bad deal. \"Actually if that looked likely we\\'d end up with worse terms and we\\'d be positively incentivising the EU to give us worse terms\" he told parliament. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

May will address the other 27 EU national leaders at a summit before they dine without her. Officials said they expected the leaders to tell May they have little more to offer since talks stalled on Sunday and will step up preparations for Britain to drop out of the bloc with no deal. Summit chair Donald Tusk said the risk of a \"no deal\" taking Britain out of the bloc and into legal limbo and border chaos on March 29 was greater than ever. He put the onus on May to bring a \"creative\" solution to break the impasse over the EU-UK land border on the island of Ireland. The \"no deal\" message is sincere enough. It is also a tactic to pressure a negotiating partner the EU views as weak. And it might help May by giving her the kind of political theatre useful in persuading Britons she has fought for the best deal. More subtly leaders may also sound relaxed on the calendar for talks. On Tuesday officials echoed the mantra that \"the clock is ticking\" to agree a treaty that parliaments can ratify in time for Brexit. But sensing more urgency in London senior EU officials said Brussels would \"keep calm and carry on\". The bloc\\'s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told ministers from the remaining 27 member states on Tuesday that December was \"the ultimate deadline\" for a deal with London to give both the European and UK parliaments time for ratification. EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Wednesday are not expected to firmly commit to an extra Brexit summit in November which they had earlier pencilled in case of an October breakthrough. UNCOMPROMISING TONE But a summit next month could be called at short notice if there is solid progress in negotiations between Brussels and London diplomats and officials said which the bloc does not expect before May gets her budget adopted in early November. \"If we have a deal on the withdrawal agreement it will be November... or early December\" Philippe Lamberts an EU lawmaker dealing with Brexit said on Wednesday. \"I do not expect the transition to end at the end of 2020.\" \"The transition period postpones the moment when the backstop will kick in.\" After an intense week of talks London on Sunday walked away from a deal in which the EU offered to extend the post-Brexit transition by a year until the end of 2021 in a way to make the emergency fix for the Irish border more palatable to Britain. This \"two-tier backstop\" would keep Britain in the EU\\'s single market and customs union for longer giving sides more time to work out a new trade deal that would maintain an open Irish border from then on. The EU insists on guarantees that extensive border checks would not return on the island of Ireland regardless of how Brexit goes something London is finding difficult to accept as it would include some trade barriers emerging inside the UK. Germany\\'s Europe minister called on May to \"take responsibility and be constructive\". Tusk said EU leaders would need to believe that a deal is nearly done to hold a Brexit summit in November. \"There needs to be a much clearer sharper messaging on the choice the UK faces\" one senior diplomat told fellow national envoys after talks broke down on Sunday. The EU had gone as far as it could to address May\\'s difficulties with her hardline pro-Brexit and Northern Irish allies he said. Quite how tough the EU message is to May after Wednesday\\'s dinner will depend on her approach diplomats said. If she brings to Brussels the uncompromising tone they heard a month ago in Salzburg then the EU warnings of impending calamity will step up. EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker will tell leaders after May has spoken on Wednesday about his European Commission\\'s plans for a \"no deal\". Officials say that will include how to rush through emergency EU legislation to cope with huge disruption to transport and trade links. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Updated at 10pm Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson quit on Monday over Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s plans to leave the European Union the second resignation in a day leaving the British leader\\'s Brexit plans in crisis. After a day when the eurosceptic foreign secretary cancelled meetings for crisis talks at his official residence in central London Johnson decided to walk from his job - just hours after May\\'s Brexit minister David Davis did the same. He was replaced later on Monday by Jeremy Hunt. The two resignations leave May badly exposed at the top of a government unable to unite over Britain\\'s biggest foreign and trading policy shift in almost half a century. It also puts a question mark over whether the leader will try to weather the resignations and stand firm in her commitment to pursue a \"business friendly\" Brexit or will be faced with more challenges to her authority and calls to quit herself. The pound fell from around $1.3340 to trade as low as $1.3259 down 0.2 percent the day after Johnson\\'s resignation was announced. \"This afternoon the prime minister accepted the resignation of Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary\" May\\'s spokesman said in a statement. \"His replacement will be announced shortly. The prime minister thanks Boris for his work.\" In his resignation statement Johnson warned that the United Kingdom would end up like a colony to the European Union:\\xa0\"We are truly headed for the status of a colony - and many will struggle to see the economic or political advantage of that particular arrangement.\"\\xa0 I am proud to have served as Foreign Secretary. It is with sadness that I step down: here is my letter explaining why. pic.twitter.com/NZXzUZCjdF The departures raise the stakes for May who believed that she had secured a hard-won agreement with her deeply divided cabinet of ministers on Friday to keep the closest possible trading ties with the EU. But it soon began to unravel when Davis resigned late on Sunday and launched a no-holds-barred attack on her plan calling it \"dangerous\" and one which would give \"too much away too easily\" to EU negotiators who would simply ask for more. With Johnson\\'s resignation a noisy rebellion among the ranks could gather steam. Many Brexit campaigners in her Conservative Party say she has betrayed her promise to pursue a clean break with the EU. She now faces a decision - whether to change her proposal or stick by it and hope that she can face down the dissenters. An actor wearing a Boris Johnson mask is joined by Sinn Fein\\'s Gerry Adams during a \\'Borders Against Brexit\\' protest in the border town of Dundalk. RELUCTANT MAY With less than nine months before Britain leaves and just over three before the EU says it wants a deal May has been forced to show her cards that she will commit the country to pursuing the closest possible trading ties with the EU. Her earlier reluctance to spell out her strategy was for fear of encouraging exactly this - angering one of the two factions in her Conservative Party that have sparred with each other since Britain voted to leave at a 2016 referendum. Many eurosceptics accused her of siding with the \"Remainers\" in her cabinet - those who voted to stay in the EU and have been lobbying for a Brexit that would preserve the complicated supply chains used by many of Britain\\'s biggest companies. They fear a clean break would cost jobs. But on the other side of the party divide they feel that her words have not been matched by her deeds proposing to negotiate a deal which could leave Britain still accepting EU rules and regulations without being able to influence them. \"I\\'m proud of both David Davis and Boris Johnson for standing by their principles\" Scottish Conservative lawmaker Ross Thomson said on Twitter. \"The decisions we take now will shape Britain\\'s relationship with the EU and the rest of the world for a generation. It\\'s imperative we do Brexit right no half measures!\" Earlier May\\'s spokesman signalled that the prime minister would not back down over her agreed negotiating stance saying May would now focus on moving the Brexit negotiations forward - a step EU officials and businesses have long called for. \"An agreement was reached by the cabinet on Friday and now we are moving forward to negotiate that plan\" May\\'s spokesman told reporters. \"As the prime minister said ... we have set out our position and it is now the EU\\'s turn to move and that she wants the EU to get serious in these negotiations.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Updated at 6.50pm Prime Minister Theresa May defeated a rebellion in parliament over her Brexit plans on Tuesday but not without having to compromise and hand lawmakers more control over Britain\\'s departure from the European Union. After winning Tuesday\\'s vote on changes to a future \"meaningful vote\" on a final agreement with Brussels in her EU withdrawal bill May\\'s plans to end more than 40 years of membership in the bloc were still on track. But her concession to parliament means that lawmakers now have more power if she fails to secure a Brexit deal which may lead to a softer approach to Britain\\'s divorce. Although as things stand they will not be able to send the government back into negotiations if they reject an agreement with the EU. Lawmakers backed a government plan ending a rebellion that would have challenged May\\'s authority at a time when she is increasingly under pressure to move ahead with all-but stalled Brexit talks in Brussels by offering a more detailed plan. The pound strengthened 0.3 per cent against the dollar to $1.3424 after the vote and hit a two-day high versus the euro of 87.78 pence. Earlier Brexit minister David Davis told parliament a government defeat would undermine negotiations with Brussels and warned lawmakers the government would never allow them to \"reverse Brexit\". \"The government cannot demonstrate the flexibility necessary for a successful deal if its hands are tied midway through that process.\" The government victory was the first major win in two days of debates on the government\\'s EU withdrawal bill which will sever ties with the EU after the upper house of parliament the House of Lords introduced 15 changes. It followed a strained parliamentary session where the deep divisions opened up by Britain\\'s vote to leave the EU in 2016 were on display with lawmakers who oppose the government saying they had received death threats or been called traitors. One Chuka Ummuna of the opposition Labour Party brandished a copy of the Daily Express newspaper which ran a headline saying: \"Ignore the will of the people at your peril\". TENSE ATMOSPHERE In the tense atmosphere where it was not clear which way the vote would go the government secured its victory only after offering concessions to one of the leaders of a group of Conservative lawmakers who were threatening to vote against May. An hour before the vote the government\\'s solicitor general Robert Buckland offered lawmaker Dominic Grieve the promise of increasing the powers of parliament if May was unable to reach agreement in Brussels. The two then hammered out a deal in whispers as other lawmakers made speeches around them. Buckland indicated the government would discuss the possibility of adopting Grieve\\'s push for ministers to secure parliamentary approval for their Brexit plans if they fail to negotiate a deal with the EU. It paid off. \"I\\'ve just voted with the government following the assurances we got from the prime minister in a meeting this afternoon that our concerns ... will be addressed\" Grieve told Sky News. \"I\\'m quite satisfied that we are going to get a meaningful vote on both \\'deal\\' and \\'no deal\\'.\" But the concessions were the latest manoeuvre by a minority government that has been forced to compromise with parliament or to simply put votes off until a later date because of its inability to force through the policies it backs. KICKING DOWN THE ROAD Earlier May appeared to have also stemmed a rebellion over her commitment to leaving the EU\\'s customs union which will transform Britain\\'s trading relationships for decades to come. Lawmakers will vote on Wednesday on whether the government\\'s move to dismiss a House of Lords amendment requiring ministers to report what efforts they had made in negotiations to secure a customs union by the end of October. Instead the government has proposed reporting its efforts to secure a customs arrangement. But the parliamentary problems will not stop there. Rebels have said they will challenge May\\'s plans to leave the customs union during votes on other bills on trade and customs which will be brought back to the house some time before July 24. There is little May can do. After losing her party\\'s majority in parliament at an ill-judged election last year she now relies on the support of a small Northern Irish party and the distance between victory and defeat is narrow. Often she simply puts off votes that could end in embarrassing defeats. But as time ticks by she can no longer kick decisions down the road increasingly under pressure from EU negotiators to come up with detailed positions not only on customs but also on the wider trade agreement and governance. The EU is expecting her to have made progress by a summit in June and both sides want to reach a deal by October. In a day of drama May\\'s position seemed suddenly weaker when junior justice minister Phillip Lee who has long been critical of the government\\'s Brexit strategy resigned and said he would vote against the government. But it has secured victory on all the other votes so far on Tuesday including a challenge to the government\\'s plan to put March 29 2019 or \\'Brexit Day\\'. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A no-deal Brexit would seriously damage the car industry in Britain and the European Union by raising costs and sowing chaos for carmakers and consumers alike the head of Britain\\'s car industry warned on Tuesday. With less than eight months until Britain is due to exit the EU Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to find a proposal to maintain economic ties with the bloc that pleases both sides of her divided party and is acceptable to negotiators in Brussels. May has stepped up precautionary planning for a so-called \"no-deal\" Brexit that would see the world\\'s fifth largest economy crash out of the EU on March 29 2019 a step that could spook financial markets and dislocate trade flows across Europe and beyond. Mike Hawes chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said carmakers were increasingly concerned about the lack of clarity around the manner of Britain\\'s departure from the EU. That has raised the prospect of Britain leaving with no deal and falling back on World Trade Organisation rules that could leave British car exporters facing EU import tariffs of around 10 percent. \"No deal... is just not an option. It would be seriously damaging to the industry not just in the UK but in Europe as well\" Hawes told reporters as he presented SMMT\\'s mid-year update on British car production. At stake is the future of one of Britain\\'s few manufacturing success stories since the 1980s - a car industry employing over 850000 people and generating annual turnover of $110 billion. Much of the industry is owned by foreign companies. The world\\'s biggest carmakers including Toyota BMW and Ford have urged Britain to ensure that they can import and export without hindrance after Brexit. Supporters of Brexit admit there may be some short-term pain for Britain\\'s $2.9 trillion economy but that long-term it will prosper when cut free from the EU which they cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration. \"No deal\"? Under the current timetable both London and Brussels hope to get a final Brexit deal in October to give enough time to ratify it by exit day. However the potential for major political upheaval remains with May\\'s minority government facing a series of make-or-break moments in the Brexit process over coming months. She must find a way to strike a deal with the EU which has already rejected her preferred plan on trade then sell that deal to her deeply fractured Conservative Party before putting it to a vote in parliament. Failure at any of those three hurdles could cost her job and thrust the United Kingdom into crisis. In an attempt to rally support for May\\'s proposals Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt visits Paris and Vienna this week. \"I will be explaining to my counterparts in Paris and Vienna that it is time for the EU to engage with our proposals or we potentially face the prospect of a no-deal by accident which would be very challenging for both the UK and EU\" Hunt said. Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn could come under pressure at its annual party conference in September to agree to support a referendum on any deal that May can secure the Guardian newspaper reported. There is deep concern in boardrooms about the prospect of Britain leaving the bloc without a deal or with a deal that would silt up the arteries of trade. That could be highly damaging for a car industry which is dependent on the speedy movement of huge numbers of parts across borders. The average car for example has about 30000 parts. Confidence among British consumers and businesses remains stuck well below levels before Britons voted in 2016 by a narrow majority for Brexit surveys showed on Tuesday two days before an expected interest rate increase by the Bank of England. The Financial Times reported that the EU\\'s chief negotiator Michel Barnier had softened his opposition to May\\'s Brexit plan for financial services after the UK acknowledged Brussels would have ultimate control over the City of London\\'s access to EU markets. British car output in the first six months of 2018 fell by an annual 3.3 percent to 834402 with disappointing domestic demand cancelling out strong exports SMMT said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

UK MPs have started to debate the final Brexit withdrawal agreement ahead of a “meaningful vote” which will still go ahead on Tuesday despite a newspaper claim that it will be postponed.\\xa0\\xa0 There are various possible scenarios that might play out after that vote some of which are outlined below. This is possibly the easiest outcome in terms of pushing forward with Brexit but the hardest to obtain given the sheer number of Conservative MPs who have said they will vote against the deal. A vote in favour would give the prime minister the power to tell the EU that the deal has been ratified by parliament. But the government would still need to pass a hefty amount of legislation as the Brexit process continues. This would begin with the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill – a piece of legislation which the House of Commons Library thinks could happen before Christmas. In the event that this first option doesn’t happen (which seems increasingly likely) the future is all a bid muddled. This is partly because it depends if MPs vote in favour of any amendments to the motion on December 11. Here the possible outcomes would be: The House of Commons speaker John Bercow can select up to six amendments to a proposed bill to also be debated and voted on by the house. In this case the proposed amendments include one by Labour MP Hilary Benn to reject both the Brexit deal and a no-deal scenario in an attempt to enhance the power for MPs to find an alternative. Labour and the SNP have said they will support the amendment. Other amendments include extending the Article 50 deadline to give more time to decide how to proceed. If MPs vote against the main motion on the deal the government would give a statement to the House of Commons within 21 days setting out how it plans to proceed as specified in the EU Withdrawal Act 2018. This would bring us to January 1 2019. Parliament would be given a week to debate the contents of this statement before a further round of ministerial statements reporting on progress by January 21. This handy chart put together by parliament shows how this would all work. If MPs vote in favour of any amendments to the motion on December 11 they will be trying to tie the prime minister’s hands and push for her to agree to parliament’s demands. This could be in the form of a second referendum for which there is now considerable support on the opposition benches. The cross-party amendment led by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve which passed in the House of Commons on the Tuesday before debating began means that parliament will be able to amend any later motions put forward by the government after the 21-day period too pushing for alternative options. In an interview on the Today programme a few days later the prime minister hinted that MPs may have more of a say on the detail of the backstop agreement on the Northern Ireland border. Parliament could be asked to vote again on the deal. This was confirmed by chief House of Commons clerk David Natzler in evidence to the Brexit select committee just over a month ago. At the time he said it was a “hypothetical question” but confirmed that there were ways in which it could happen as the procedures of the House would not want to obstruct progress. Keir Starmer Labour’s Brexit spokesman has said the party would “inevitably” call a vote of no confidence if the prime minister loses the vote on December 11. MPs would have to vote on a specifically worded motion in accordance with the Fixed Term Parliaments Act saying “That this house has no confidence in HM government”. If MPs voted in favour of the motion it would trigger a two-week period in which a new government could be formed. Only if this failed would a general election be triggered. MPs may not be eager for a general election particularly with the Brexit clock ticking. If the prime minister survived a no-confidence vote there would be increasing pressure on Conservative backbenchers to support her on the Brexit deal. There is also the outside option that the prime minister herself could ask the House of Commons for an early general election but this would require a super majority of two thirds of MPs voting in favour. What makes this even more complicated is that the formal parliamentary route to Brexit is sitting alongside a party political one. So alongside the various legal options we also see the possibility that May could face a leadership challenge from her own party. If she loses the vote on the final deal May might resign triggering a leadership election within the Conservative Party. At the moment it seems anything is possible but given her emphatic statement last month that she believed with her head and her heart that “this is a decision which is in the best interests of our entire United Kingdom” it seems unlikely. And while the party took just 17 days to decide on May as the next leader when David Cameron resigned it generally takes a lot longer. A full contest would likely drag on through January. And with the latest survey of party members showing a clear lead for Boris Johnson as the favourite to take over as party leader MPs may be forgiven for thinking that they are safer to stay with May for now.

British Prime Minister Theresa May held talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel Tuesday in a last-gasp bid to keep her country from crashing out of the European Union at the end of the week. May will also meet French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris seeking support from the bloc\\'s powerbrokers for her request to delay Brexit for a second time. She is hoping EU leaders will agree at an emergency summit on Wednesday to postpone Brexit from April 12 to June 30 to give her more time to get her divorce deal through parliament. British MPs have rejected the text and May\\'s government is now in talks with the opposition Labour party to try to find a way through the deadlock. But these discussions are moving slowly and EU negotiator Michel Barnier said May must explain in Brussels what another postponement would achieve. \"The length of the extension must be linked to the purpose - what it\\'s for - and that depends on what Mrs May will say to European leaders tomorrow\" he told reporters after a meeting of EU ministers in Luxembourg. He added: \"It is for her to bring the roadmap.\" The EU has already granted one delay - the original Brexit deadline was March 29 - and Barnier said it would not be the bloc\\'s fault if Britain crashed out this week risking huge economic disruption. \"No deal will never be the EU\\'s decision it will always be the responsibility of the United Kingdom to tell us what it wants\" he said. Delay conditions EU ministers have expressed frustration at the turmoil in London where MPs still cannot decide how to leave the EU almost three years after the referendum vote for Brexit. \"We are in a very very frustrating situation here\" said Germany\\'s Europe minister Michael Roth as he arrived in Luxembourg. His French counterpart Amelie de Montchalin told reporters that \"we want to understand what the UK needs this extension for\". \"And then comes the question of the conditions of what role we\\'d want the UK to play during this extension time\" she added. Britain is requesting only a short delay to avoid having to take part in European Parliament elections next month but EU leaders are expected to offer a longer postponement. EU Council president Donald Tusk\\'s office has floated the idea of a \"flexible\" extension of up to a year with an option for London to leave earlier if it finds a way through but there is no agreement on this. Some in the EU are worried that during a long delay British representatives could disrupt EU budget planning and reforms during indefinite Brexit talks. A spokesman for May said Britain had \"engaged constructively through this process and you can expect the UK to continue to do so\". Neither May nor Merkel spoke to the media during their talks in Berlin but the German leader has previously said she would work \"until the last hour\" to avoid a \"no deal\" Brexit. However Macron - who May meets in Paris on Tuesday evening - has raised the possibility of rejecting the delay request warning he does not want to simply prolong the uncertainty. Labour talks May is now hoping for more progress with Labour although its leader Jeremy Corbyn said Monday he was still waiting for signs of compromise. \"The problem is that the government doesn\\'t seem to be moving off the original red lines\" he said. His top team was meeting Tuesday with some of May\\'s senior ministers including leading Brexit supporter Michael Gove and her more pro-European finance minister Philip Hammond. Corbyn wants Britain to agree a new customs arrangements with the EU after Brexit and believes these could be included in a text May has already agreed with Brussels setting out the shape of future trade ties. But many of her ministers and MPs are strongly opposed to the idea of closer ties with the bloc saying it would undermine the potential of Brexit.

Nigel Farage launched his Brexit Party\\'s campaign Friday for the European Parliament elections - a vote Britain was never meant to take part in but which is now being seen as a referendum on its stalled drive out of the EU. The former UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader was a leading light of the pro-Brexit camp in a bitterly divisive 2016 referendum that voted to pull Britain out of the European Union after nearly half a century. He now hopes to transform Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s failure to complete the split by its original March 29 deadline into big gains for Brexit supporters. \"I genuinely believe right now this nation we are lions led by donkeys\" Farage told his maiden campaign event in Coventry - a mediaeval central England city left in ruins by World War II bombing raids. \"We can win these European elections and... start to put the fear of God into our members of parliament in Westminster -- they deserve nothing less.\" Britain has found itself in the embarrassing position of having to prepare for a European vote three years after deciding to leave the bloc. May\\'s struggle to get her EU divorce terms approved by parliament forced the other 27 nations at a summit earlier this week to grant Britain a second Brexit extension that could run up to October 31. This requires the UK to field candidates for the May 23 European Parliament election. Farage said the chaos showed that Britain\\'s leaders were \"pretty much incompetent\". Not everything went smoothly at the launch for the 55-year-old former commodities trader in London\\'s bustling financial district. It turned out that Farage forgot to register thebrexitparty.com website and a campaign group calling themselves \"Led By Donkeys\" grabbed it instead. \"Nobody is more responsible than Farage for the diminished state of our nation\" thebrexitparty.com\\xa0site now says. \"It\\'s time to stop Farage.\" Outsiders Those out to do just that include a new group of prominent pro-European lawmakers who broke from May\\'s Conservatives and the main opposition Labour Party in February. The Independent Group (TIG) is re-branding itself as \"Change UK\" and commands 11 of the 650 seats in the House of Commons. Its overarching ambition is to keep Britain in Europe by forcing a new Brexit referendum that includes the option of reversing the first one\\'s results. \"We are clear: Brexit is proving to be undeliverable\" Change UK spokesman Chuka Umunna - a telegenic 40-year-old native Londoner who quit Labour - said in an introductory campaign statement. \"We believe the people should have the final say on this matter and the best option is for the UK to remain a full member of the European Union.\" The European vote offers startup parties a rare chance to grab the national limelight - and secure treasured funding should they actually win seats in Strasbourg. An outfit called The Renew Party kicked off its campaign by promising to give a voice to \"people from outside politics\" who still view themselves as Europeans and believers in causes such as fighting climate change. It said it was \"ready to speak up for disenfranchised voters who cannot rely on the Conservative and Labour parties\". \\'Damage trust\\' The elections pose a major headache for both major parties. May\\'s Conservatives will have to face supporters frustrated by the party\\'s inability to lead the way on the biggest issue to face Britain in generations. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay admitted last week that \"asking the public to hold elections for an organisation we are meant to have left would damage trust in politics\". Labour meanwhile is splintered over whether to back a second Brexit vote. The party includes both Brexit backers and opponents - a division that has left leader Jeremy Corbyn trying to navigate a vague middle ground. \"It is hard to imagine a worse time for Labour and the (Conservatives) to face the only UK-wide proportional electoral contest\" said Anand menon European politics professor at King\\'s College London. \"These elections could accelerate the fragmentation of a fragile two-party stalemate providing an institutional foothold for new parties forged on the issue of Europe.\" Ex-soldier confesses to shooting slain Slovak journalist Strong 6.8 quake hits off eastern Indonesia tsunami warning lifted: USGS \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s ambassador to the European Union has abruptly resigned just three months before Prime Minister Theresa May starts formal Brexit negotiations. Ivan Rogers Britain\\'s permanent representative to the EU told staff on Tuesday afternoon that he would be step down from his post early said the Financial Times which was first to report the resignation on Tuesday. Rogers did not explain the reasons for resigning according to people who have seen his note to diplomatic staff the FT said. Two sources who asked for anonymity later confirmed the FT report that Rogers had resigned. \"This weakens May\\'s ability to get a good EU deal\" said Charles Grant Director of the Centre for European Reform think tank. \"Ivan Rogers was one of the very few people at the top of the British government who understand the EU.\" The resignation is the second by a senior British EU official in the wake of the referendum. Jonathan Hill quit as Britain\\'s European commissioner in June. Ivan Rogers was one of the very few people at the top of the British government who understand the EU May has said she will trigger formal Brexit talks - likely to be among the most complicated negotiations in post-World War Two European history - by the end of March. Britons\\' vote to leave the bloc has opened a huge number of questions including whether exporters will keep tariff-free access to the single European market and British-based banks will still be able to serve continental clients not to mention immigration and the future rights of the many EU citizens already living in the United Kingdom. Allies company bosses and investors are trying to work out what Brexit might mean for the European Union Britain and for London the only global financial centre to rival New York. Rogers appointed by former Prime Minister David Cameron as Britain\\'s envoy to Brussels in November 2013 is one of Britain\\'s most experienced diplomats on EU affairs. He formerly worked in Downing Street the British Treasury the European Commission and at Citigroup and Barclays Capital. But after Cameron lost the June 23 Brexit vote Rogers drew criticism for lacking ambition in Cameron\\'s 2015 attempt to redefine Britain\\'s relationship with the bloc. The failure of Cameron\\'s so called EU \"renegotiation\" was cast by some supporters as one of the reasons that Cameron lost the June vote. Rogers warned May\\'s ministers that the European consensus was that a trade deal with the EU might not be done until the early to mid-2020s and that national parliaments could ultimately reject it the BBC reported last month. Hilary Benn chairman of parliament\\'s Brexit committee said a change in such a significant position was \"not a good thing\". \"This is a time for continuity and experience because this going to be a very complex a very challenging a very difficult negotiation\" Benn told BBC radio. \"It\\'s an absolutely vital job both conveying the British government\\'s view to the other 27 members states but also honestly reporting back what he was picking up about the attitude of the other 27 towards the forthcoming negotiations.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 6th 09:36  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) cut its global growth forecasts for the next two years yesterday citing uncertainty over Britain’s looming exit from the EU. The move included a nearly full percentage-point reduction in the UK’s 2017 growth forecast. Cutting its World Economic Outlook forecasts for the fifth time in 15 months the IMF said that it now expects global GDP to grow at 3.1 per cent in 2016 and at 3.4 per cent in 2017 — down 0.1 percentage point for each year from estimates issued in April. The Fund said that despite recent improvements in Japan and Europe and a partial recovery in commodity prices the UK’s Brexit vote had created a “sizeable increase in uncertainty” that would take its toll on investment and market and consumer confidence. On the day before Britain’s June 23 EU referendum the IMF was “prepared to upgrade our 2016-2017 global growth projections slightly” IMF chief economist Maury Obstfeld said in a statement. “But Brexit has thrown a spanner in the works.” The IMF said that the impact will hit hardest in Britain itself where the institution cut its 2016 growth forecast to 1.7 per cent down 0.2 percentage points from its April forecast. It cut the 2017 UK forecast more sharply by 0.9 percentage points to 1.3 per cent. The IMF lifted its euro zone forecast slightly for 2016 but cut its 2017 outlook by 0.2 percentage point to 1.4 per cent for 2017. It said last week that Brexit would have a “negligible” impact on the US. The IMF noted that its latest forecasts were made under relatively benign assumptions of a settlement between the EU and Britain that leads to limited political fallout avoids a major increase in economic barriers and prompts no major further financial market disruptions. But the Fund also modelled other scenarios including a “severe” one in which the divorce negotiations go badly financial stress intensifies the UK-EU trading relationship reverts to World Trade Organisation rules and London loses a large portion of its financial services sector to continental Europe. Under that scenario Britain would fall into recession and global growth would slow to 2.8 per cent in both 2016 and 2017 the IMF said. A middle scenario labelled “downside” would see tighter financial conditions and lower consumer confidence than the baseline with the UK losing some of its financial services sector to Europe. It shows global growth at 2.9 per cent in 2016 and 3.1 per cent in 2017. Obstfeld said that the financial market recovery following the initial Brexit shock helped persuade the IMF to go with the most benign of the three scenarios. Responding to the IMF’s report a UK Treasury spokeswoman said that the Brexit vote marks a “new phase” for Britain’s economy but the country would remain globally focused. “Our absolute priority is to send a clear signal to businesses both here and across the world that we are open for business and determined to keep Britain an attractive destination for investors from overseas” the spokeswoman said in a statement. The IMF said China’s outlook was largely unchanged with a slight improvement to 6.6 per cent seen in 2016 but still slowing to 6.2 per cent in 2017. Recessions in Brazil and Russia will be less severe than previously forecast this year due partly to some recovery in oil and commodities prices the IMF said adding that both countries will return to positive growth in 2017. The Fund urged policymakers not to accept the tepid growth rates as a “new normal” and said that they should support demand in the near-term and structural reforms to aid medium-term growth. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 6th 09:36  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain may have to wait – and hope – for every single one of its European Union neighbours to give full legislative consent before it can fully benefit from any post-Brexit free trade deal EU judges ruled today. In a verdict that may also delay and potentially obstruct a string of other EU trade pacts notably with Japan and in Latin America the European Court of Justice (ECJ) said an agreement struck with Singapore in 2014 cannot take full effect until ratified by 33 national and regional parliaments across the 28-nation bloc. The European Commission which runs trade policy for the EU had hoped Brussels – where national governments also have a say – might get more freedom to implement deals without the vagaries that saw an accord with Canada nearly wrecked last year by the Walloon assembly in Belgium. The Commission sought the ruling and said it clarified divisions between EU and national powers. London wants a trade agreement to keep much of its current access to Europe's single market once it quits the EU in March 2019. But Brussels negotiators have warned such deals typically take five or more years to negotiate and longer to ratify creating pressure to agree transitional arrangements when Brexit negotiations get under way following Britain's June 8 election. Any trade pact with Britain would need to be signed off in Brussels by all 27 EU governments after Brexit but the ECJ ruling implies that national parliaments would also get a veto. Verbal skirmishing between the two sides this month over the EU's refusal to open trade talks until Britain agrees to settle payments to Brussels and guarantee European immigrants' rights has generated new warnings that negotiations could simply fail. Any trade pact with Britain would need to be signed off in Brussels by all 27 EU governments after Brexit but the ECJ ruling implies that national parliaments would also get a veto. So would federal Belgium's five regional assemblies among them Wallonia and German-speaking East Belgium (population 77000). Among elements of the Singapore deal that the ECJ said fell beyond the centralised powers of the Union and so requires the separate national ratifications was its creation of a judicial mechanism to settle disputes between businesses and governments. Such supranational legal powers have been at the heart of opposition in Europe to recent free trade deals – including the last-ditch move by Wallonia's left-wing leaders to halt the EU's CETA pact with Canada last year. EU officials want to ease concerns that such powers favour big multinationals by ensuring future deals more clearly protect states' rights to regulate. British Prime Minister Theresa May has made rejecting EU regulation and non-British courts like the ECJ in Luxembourg priorities for Brexit. That means negotiations on a UK-EU trade deal could be fraught when it comes to agreeing who supervises and regulates business including in the complex area of services which accounts for most of Britain's economy. Brussels hopes to seal trade agreements soon with Japan Mexico and the Mercosur quartet of Argentina Brazil Paraguay and Uruguay. It was in negotiations with the United States on a pact known as TTIP though those talks are on hold since Donald Trump became president this year.

Photo: Dominic Lipinski/PA Wire  Downing Street has described as “speculation” reports that Theresa May is preparing to offer a further £20 billion to help clear the way for\\xa0Brexit\\xa0trade talks. The Sun reported the offer would be made ahead of a crunch Brussels summit in December when leaders of the remaining 27 EU states will decide whether sufficient progress has been made on the UK’s “divorce bill” – as well as citizens’ rights and the Irish border – to move on to the second phase of Brexit\\xa0negotiations dealing with the future relationship. If confirmed the £20 billion figure would bring to around £38 billion the total sum Britain is prepared to pay to settle its liabilities – well short of the £53 billion sought by Brussels. May has so far held back from putting any figure on the financial settlement in public and it is thought likely that any offer ahead of the December 14-15 summit would come in the form of clearer guidance on what commitments the UK is ready to cover. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said reports of a £20 billion figure were “yet more speculation”. He declined to confirm suggestions from senior MEP Manfred Weber – a close ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel – that May had indicated a readiness to compromise in a meeting on Wednesday. The PM set out her determination to secure a unique deal Following their talks at 10 Downing Street Weber who leads the centre-right EPP in the European Parliament told reporters: “I am more optimistic. There is progress and a will to see progress.” On the financial settlement Weber said that while the UK did not have to state a figure at this stage it did need spell out which of its outstanding commitments to the EU it was prepared to honour. May’s spokesman described the meeting as “constructive” adding: “The Prime Minister set out her determination to secure a unique deal for Britain but one that works in both our interests. She also set out a very clear position in terms of an implementation period that will serve both Britain and the EU providing clarity for business and others.” Failure to secure agreement at the December summit would be a major setback for the Prime Minister as the next opportunity for EU leaders to green-light the second phase talks will not be until March. It would almost certainly prompt demands from hardline\\xa0Brexiteers for May to walk away from the negotiating table. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Sky News: “Our problem is this – we do not know from one day to another what the government’s strategy is or which coalition there is in the Cabinet that is actually ruling the roost at the moment. “In that way there’s an inconsistent approach. We have a government in disarray. There’s no way you can negotiate a decent deal when really the government that’s meant to be doing these negotiations is directionless.” Brexit Secretary David Davis was due to make a keynote speech on\\xa0Brexit\\xa0to an economic summit in Berlin yesterday evening. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 6th 09:36  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Brexit minister David Davis said today the government would allow parliament the opportunity to debate scrutinise and vote on any final Brexit agreement offering a concession to Conservative Party rebels. Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure to offer a \\'meaningful vote\\' on any deal for Britain\\'s departure from the European Union. Members of her own party are willing to vote against the government to stymie a bill which she says is needed to sever ties with the bloc. \"I can now confirm that once we\\'ve reached an agreement we will bring forward a specific piece of primary legislation to implement that agreement\" Davis told parliament. Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure to offer a \\'meaningful vote\\' on any deal for Britain\\'s departure from the European Union \"This also means that parliament will be given time to debate scrutinise and vote on the final agreement we strike with the European Union. This agreement will only hold if parliament approves it.\" May\\'s blueprint for Britain\\'s exit from the EU faces a crucial test starting on Tuesday when lawmakers will debate the EU withdrawal bill that she says is crucial to give companies confidence that the rules will not change after Brexit. Lawmakers have proposed 186 pages of amendments to the bill which largely \\'copy and paste\\' EU rules and regulations into British law but also critics say hand the government wide-ranging powers and cut parliament out of some Brexit planning. Davis said the government would allow parliament the chance to vote on a \\'withdrawal agreement and implementation bill\\' once it has secured a Brexit deal with the European Union which both sides aim to do by late next year. \"This confirms that the major policies set out in the withdrawal agreement (with the EU) will be directly implemented into UK law by primary legislation\" he said. Primary legislation means making law by acts of parliament or statute. Others said the change in procedure would mean that if Britain failed to negotiate a deal with the EU parliament would have no say Some lawmakers welcomed the move but others said the change in procedure would mean that if Britain failed to negotiate a deal with the EU parliament would have no say and that there would not be time for a proper chance to have sway over a deal. \"Hasn\\'t he just given the game away on what a sham offer this is? Totally worthless to parliament essentially trying to buy off people\" Chris Leslie a member of the opposition Labour Party and a pro-EU campaigner said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

May\\'s first trip to Japan as prime minister comes at a difficult moment with Japanese attention focused on North Korea\\'s Tuesday missile test and Britain\\'s Brexit negotiators recently on the receiving end of sharp criticism from EU officials. May will lead a 15-strong business delegation including Standard Life Investment chief executive Keith Skeoch and carmaker Aston Martin\\'s CEO Andy Palmer pitching Britain and Japan as the \"perfect partners for the future\". My discussions with Prime Minister Abe will focus on how we can prepare the ground for an ambitious free trade agreement after Brexit based on the EU-Japan agreement which I very much hope is nearing conclusion She will meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Kyoto before travelling to Tokyo for an investment conference and banquet. May and Abe are due to speak publicly on Thursday following one-to-one talks. \"My discussions with Prime Minister Abe will focus on how we can prepare the ground for an ambitious free trade agreement after Brexit based on the EU-Japan agreement which I very much hope is nearing conclusion\" May said in a statement ahead of her departure. May will also discuss defence cooperation describing Japan as \"our closest security partner in Asia\". She will become the first European leader to attend a meeting of Japan\\'s National Security Council and will also visit its flagship helicopter carrier Izumo for a briefing with military officials. North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan\\'s northern Hokkaido island into the sea early on Tuesday prompting warnings to residents to take cover and drawing a sharp reaction from Abe. May also strongly condemned the launch. Britain is the second most important destination for Japanese investment after the United States Japan\\'s foreign ministry said the two leaders are expected to agree on the importance of China\\'s role in ramping up pressure on North Korea. Japan has been unusually outspoken about its concerns that Britain\\'s departure from the EU which was decided by a public vote in 2016 could affect current and future Japanese investments in Britain. Britain is the second most important destination for Japanese investment after the United States with firms like Nissan Toyota and Hitachi investing billions in carmaking energy and transport. During a visit to London by Abe in April Britain said that Japanese companies had already invested over £40 billion in the British economy. But Japan is also an important destination for British investment. Aston Martin said on Tuesday it would open an advanced product planning office next year in Japan to better understand the needs of Asian buyers and tap into new technologies. Speaking ahead of May\\'s visit Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasutoshi Nishimura said Tokyo had to react to \"a sense of crisis among businesses\" over Brexit and gather information about the British negotiating strategy. Britain has published a series of papers setting out how it wants to settle its divorce with the EU and is pushing for talks to move on to discuss the future relationship between the two - something of critical importance to investors. But European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker insisted on Tuesday that the new relationship could not be discussed until initial differences had been resolved and the EU\\'s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Monday he was concerned at the slow progress made so far. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 6th 09:36  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Sterling rose further yesterday after Brussels gave Britain a Brexit deadline extension but stocks dived as fresh economic gloom gripped trading floors. European equities tanked and the euro sank under $1.13 as poor eurozone manufacturing data rekindled fears over the state of the world economy dealers said. The pound however pushed higher one day after European Union leaders agreed at a crucial summit to delay Brexit following a request from Prime Minister Theresa May. If the premier fails next week to push her divorce agreement through a fractious Parliament that has already rejected the deal twice Brexit will take place on April 12 unless London agrees to take part in European elections. If she manages to get it passed the exit date will be pushed back until May 22. Prior to the offer Britain had been due to crash out from the bloc next Friday. “Sterling remains very volatile as EU leaders have moved to stop a chaotic no-deal Brexit from happening next week by handing Theresa May an extra fortnight” said Oanda analyst Craig Popplewell. “The UK must decide by April 12 what it will do next” he added. However the stronger pound weighed on London’s FTSE 100 index which has a large number of multinationals whose earnings are reported in dollars. Poor manufacturing data meanwhile set alarm bells ringing for investors. “A series of worse than expected economic releases from Europe have sounded the alarm bell not just for the bloc but also the global economy by providing further evidence of a worldwide slowdown in economic activity” said XTB analysts David Cheetham. Signs of a weak first quarter for the eurozone mounted yesterday as a closely-watched survey pointed to March output being dragged further down by manufacturing weakness especially in Germany Europe’s largest economy. Data company IHS Markit said in a first estimate for the month that while services firms proved “resilient” manufacturers in the 19-nation single currency bloc “reported their steepest downturn for six years” as pressure mounted from trade wars and Brexit fears. At 47.6 points ‒ down from 49.3 last month ‒ the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) sank further below the crucial 50-point threshold between expansion and contraction. A headline “composite” figure that also includes services re-mained in positive territory although it shed 0.6 points compared with February to land at 51.3. In late trading Germany’s blue-chip DAX 30 was down 0.8 per cent while the CAC 40 in Paris fell 1.3 per cent. London’s FTSE 100 dropped 1.4 per cent with the strong pound adding pressure to stocks. Yesterday Wall Street opened lower with the Dow sliding 0.6 per cent in the first minute of trading. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Germany and other European Union states told Britain on Monday their draft Brexit agreement could not be renegoitated. British Prime Minister Theresa May is battling at home to keep the last week\\'s deal alive and push it through the British parliament amid criticism from pro-Brexit politicians Northern Ireland\\'s unionists and those who want to keep closer EU ties. \"No deal better than the one on the table can be reached\" Germany\\'s European affairs minister Michael Roth said. Economy minister Peter Altmaier also dismissed any prospect of a return to the drafting table. More than two years after Britons voted in a 2016 referendum to leave the EU the sides have reached a tentative divorce agreement and are working on an outline of their future ties to accompany that. Though the fate of the accord is unclear on the British side the EU is preparing for a summit next Sunday of all its national leaders that is meant to rubber-stamp the agreement.No deal better than the one on the table can be reached They are also advancing their contingency planning for the scenario of a no-deal Brexit in which the sides would fail to seal their agreement and the United Kingdom is cut off on March 29 2019 with very little in place to mitigate the economic and other disruptions. \"Any deal is better than no deal\" Luxembourg\\'s Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn told reporters on arrival to talks of national EU ministers about Brexit in Brussels. \"I think that it\\'s in the interests of the United Kingdom and the European Union...that this deal becomes reality.\" Belgium\\'s Didier Reynders echoed that and the Netherlands\\' Stef Blok called for an \"ambitious\" vision of the EU-British future ties in the political declaration that the sides are working on now to accompany the divorce deal. \"We hope that we will not have to reopen negotiations\" the Czech Republic\\'s Ales Chmelar said. UK could ask to extend transition period to 2022 Meanwhile business secretary Greg Clark said on Monday the United Kingdom could ask for a longer Brexit transition period if needed not ruling out the possibility it could last until 2022. The United Kingdom is due to formally leave the EU on March 29 2019 but a planned transition period means it will remain a member in all but name until the end of December 2020. Asked on BBC radio about an extension to the transition period Clark said: \"It would be at our request.\" \"It would be our discretion it would be purely for us if we wanted to and there are reasons we may not want to take that up it would be available to us\" he said. He did not rule out a suggestion that it could last until 2022. \"If we were six weeks away from concluding a future economic partnership and agreeing that then it may make sense to extend the transition period\" Clark said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 6th 09:36  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Stocks jumped yesterday as investors clung to hopes of a detente in the China-US trade war and picked through the rubble of conflagrations in other top economies with heightened uncertainty over Brexit and French protests. A report China is moving to cut import tariffs on American-made cars drove European stocks to extend gains strongly as auto stocks jumped and the market interpreted this as a sign China is ready to make concessions on trade. The report came after China’s Vice Premier Liu He exchanged views on the next stage of trade talks with US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. S&P 500 and Dow futures were up 0.8 to 1 per cent indicating a strong session on Wall Street. Euro zone stocks rose 1.8 per cent and Germany’s DAX climbed 2 per cent while Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 1.6 per cent. Germany’s DAX the most China-sensitive market in Europe last week entered bear market territory. MSCI’s world equity index gained 0.4 per cent – set for its first day of gains after a five-day losing streak. China’s blue-chip index had risen 0.5 per cent overnight. Sterling meanwhile still floundered near 20-month lows as the market sought clarity on the next steps for Brexit after Britain’s prime minister postponed a vote on her deal. Sterling hesitantly rose 0.4 per cent to $1.2610 as traders sought to price in a range of possibilities after Prime Minister Theresa May’s abrupt decision to postpone a parliamentary vote on her Brexit agreement on Monday a move that sent the pound spiralling down to $1.2505. Goldman Sachs analysts said volatility across UK assets has increased with option markets pricing a wider range of outcomes including Brexit without a deal a last-minute agreement or another referendum on EU membership. Ms May embarked on the first leg of a trip to meet European leaders yesterday seeking support for changes to her Brexit deal while at home some lawmakers agitated for a vote of no confidence. The EU was adamant the withdrawal agreement including its most contentious element – a “backstop” for the Northern Ireland frontier – could not be renegotiated. In emerging markets stocks rose 0.4 per cent from one-month lows hit on Monday. The shock resignation of India’s central bank governor hurt India’s NSE share index initially but it closed up 0.6 per cent helped by election results in three states which were not as poor for the ruling party as some had expected. Oil prices rebounded strongly from earlier losses having sunk on Monday. US crude futures climbed 1.2 per cent to $51.61 and Brent futures rose 0.8 per cent to $60.47. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May faces one of the most the most dangerous moments of her premiership as she tries to convince senior ministers and parliament to accept a draft divorce deal agreed with the European Union. Here is reaction: JEREMY CORBYN LEADER OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION LABOUR PARTY \"We will look at the details of what has been agreed when they are available. But from what we know of the shambolic handling of these negotiations this is unlikely to be a good deal for the country. \"Labour has been clear from the beginning that we need a deal to support jobs and the economy - and that guarantees standards and protections. If this deal doesn\\'t meet our six tests and work for the whole country then we will vote against it.\" BORIS JOHNSON FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER \"It is vassal state stuff. For the first time in a thousand years this place this parliament will not have a say over the laws that govern this country. It is a quite incredible state of affairs. It means having to accept rules and regulations over which we have no say ourselves. It is utterly unacceptable to anyone who believes in democracy. \"For the first time since partition Dublin under these proposals will have more say in some aspects of the government of Northern Ireland than London. So I don\\'t see how you can support it.\" SAMMY WILSON DUP\\'S BREXIT SPOKESMAN \"All of the great and the good who were rolled out during the #EURef (EU referendum) will be rolled out again in the coming weeks to try and get us to fall into line. We are clear - we will not be voting for this humiliation!\" JACOB REES-MOGG LEADER OF HARD-BREXIT FACTION OF CONSERVATIVE LAWMAKERS \"This is the vassal state. It is a failure of the government\\'s negotiating position it is a failure to deliver on Brexit and it is potentially dividing up the United Kingdom. It is very hard to see any reason why the cabinet should support Northern Ireland being ruled from Dublin.\" \"I hope the cabinet will block it and if not I hope parliament will block it. I think what we know of this deal is deeply unsatisfactory.\" JULIAN SMITH PM MAY\\'S CHIEF WHIP \"I\\'m confident we\\'ll get this through parliament and that we can deliver on what the Prime Minister committed to on delivering Brexit but making sure that that is in the best interests of companies businesses and families. \"It\\'s a major document hundreds of pages and people will be looking at that carefully but I\\'m confident that... we\\'re hopefully on the cusp of beginning to get to the point where we\\'re delivering on Brexit in a really practical way.\" IAIN DUNCAN SMITH FORMER CONSERVATIVE LEADER Asked if the government\\'s days were numbered he referred to reports of the deal and said: \"If this is the case the answer is almost certainly yes because they\\'re in real trouble if they bring back something unacceptable to their party.\" NICOLA STURGEON SCOTLAND\\'S FIRST MINISTER \"If the PM\\'s \\'deal\\' satisfies no-one and can\\'t command a majority we mustn\\'t fall for her spin that the UK crashing out of EU without a deal is then inevitable - instead we should take the opportunity to get better options back on the table.\" \"(May\\'s) approach would take Scotland out of the single market - despite our 62 percent remain vote - but leave us competing for investment with Northern Ireland that is effectively still in it.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The Home Office on Thursday tweeted a video with information about the EU settlement scheme which is planned to be fully up and running by March 30 2019 - a day after Britain is set to leave the European Union. \"We guess being reminded over Christmas of the \\'need to apply\\' to stay in the country we call home.... will go down pretty badly in households across the UK. Poor timing @UKhomeoffice\" The3Million a campaign group for EU nationals living in Britain said on Twitter. EU nationals who want to stay in Britain have to apply by June 30 2021 and will be charged £65 (€72) each for people aged 16 or over and £32.50 for under-16s. The scheme which is currently being tested will ask for proof of identity and proof of residence and will also check whether applicants have a criminal record. EU nationals who have lived in Britain for five years or more can apply for \"settled status\" which is permanent. Those who have lived in Britain for under five years can apply for \"pre-settled status\" which will allow them to stay and acquire permanent status after five years. Britain is yet to unveil detailed proposals on the immigration for EU nationals arriving after Brexit. Stella Creasy an MP from the main opposition Labour Party criticised the policy of charging EU nationals to apply. \"EU friends and neighbours - you deserve so much better than this. UK - be better than this\" she tweeted. Creasy said it was \"a jolly message this Christmas from govt to say Brexit means we want to charge you to live in the country you have made your home\". Ed Davey an MP from the Liberal Democrats a minor opposition party that supports Britain staying in the EU said: \"Brexit-backing MPs should hang their heads in shame. \"Look at what you are doing to millions of our fellow citizens who have lived & worked in our country for years.\" Fraser Nelson from the Spectator magazine wrote that the Home Office tweet was \"sinister\" and \"quite disgusting\". \"The idea that if you want to \\'continue living\\' in Britain then you need to \\'apply\\' -- rather than register - is unforgivable\" he wrote. In the meantime\\xa0Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez sent a message of calm on Friday to British people living in Spain and Spaniards living in Britain assuring them that their rights would remain the same after Britain\\'s exit from the European Union. The government was working on measures to ensure Britons living in Spain would maintain their rights even if Britain crashed out of the EU without a deal he said. The measures were conditioned on Spaniards getting the same rights in Britain he added. Spain is the most popular European retirement destination for Britons and is home to around 300000 mostly settled on the coast. Britain is by far the biggest user of Spain\\'s state-funded universal health care system amongst foreign nationals. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May on Saturday mulled a possible fourth attempt to get her Brexit agreement through parliament faced with the growing risk of a chaotic no-deal exit in less than two weeks\\' time. MPs on Friday resoundingly rejected May\\'s deal although by a substantially lower margin than on two previous occasions in January and March. \"We believe the best way to respect the referendum is to deliver the deal\" Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis told BBC radio on Saturday. Noting the growing support for her deal despite the defeat May\\'s spokesman told reporters on Friday: \"We are at least going in the right direction.\" MPs are due to gather again on Monday to consider possible changes to the deal that could ensure it is adopted including support for closer economic ties with the European Union after Britain leaves. The government is opposed to revisions of its Brexit strategy and May pointed out on Friday that any options would still require first that parliament approve her withdrawal agreement -- the document spelling out the terms of the divorce. The withdrawal agreement allows for a long transition period which would temporarily maintain the status quo to give individuals and businesses time to adapt to the future UK-EU relationship. National unity government?\\xa0 Three years after Britain voted to leave the EU in a historic referendum the process is deadlocked by a stand-off between the government and parliament. Thousands of flag-waving protesters rallied outside parliament on Friday to accuse MPs of betraying Brexit by delaying it holding up signs saying \"Give Our kingdom Back\" and \"Free Britain now\". \"Brexiteers\" in May\\'s party oppose the deal because they believe it does not go far enough in severing ties with Brussels while \"Remainers\" want closer ties with the EU like Norway or Switzerland. Some would prefer Brexit is stopped altogether. Conservative MP Nicky Morgan a former cabinet minister told BBC radio that a government of national unity may be required to break the impasse. \"There have been periods in our history when we have had national unity governments or a coalition for a very specific issue\" she said. No-deal \\'a growing possibility\\'\\xa0 Britain had been due to leave the EU on Friday the long-heralded March 29 \"Independence Day\" but with paralysis in parliament May asked European leaders last week for a little more time. She now faces having to explain what happens next after EU Council President Donald Tusk called a Brussels summit for April 10. The EU has set a deadline of April 12 for a decision with two likely options: Britain leaves with no deal at all or agrees a lengthy extension to allow time for a new approach. The prime minister has said it would be \"unacceptable\" to ask voters to take part in European Parliament elections in May. MPs have repeatedly rejected a \"no-deal\" outcome fearing catastrophe if Britain severs ties with its closest trading partner with no plan. However this remains the default legal option. Following the vote Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said it was \"a growing possibility\".

Global stock markets retreated yesterday as China-US trade talk euphoria faded with London equities also hurt by a rally in the British pound on speculation over a possible Brexit delay. Markets had hurtled higher Monday after US President Donald Trump said he would delay a hike in tariffs on Chinese goods and described the two countries as being in “advanced stages” of negotiations towards a deal. However as the dust settled on Tuesday doubts festered over whether Beijing and Washington can resolve their bitter trade war. “Stocks have handed back some of yesterday\\'s gains as the optimism surrounding US-China trade relations has faded” said CMC Markets analyst David Madden. “It was a welcome relief that the US won\\'t be implementing higher tariffs on Chinese imports  but the trade spat is far from over and investors are wondering: where do we go from here?” Trump\\'s decision to waive this week\\'s deadline for China-US negotiations and his upbeat tone on their progress had lit a fire under equities Monday on hopes the long-running dispute could be nearing its end. In London on Tuesday sterling rose on a report that Prime Minister Theresa May was considering putting off the March 29 deadline for Britain to leave the European Union if she is unable to push her own deal through parliament as she attempts to avoid a no-deal divorce. In reaction the pound leapt to $1.3238 ‒ the highest level since October. And the European single currency touched a 21-month peak at 85.88 pence. Addressing lawmakers later in the day May promised to allow parliament to delay Brexit by up to three months so that Britain would not crash out of the European Union without a deal on the scheduled departure date of March 29. \"The FTSE is losing ground ... as a stronger pound is hitting major industrials and a prospect of a delay in Brexit is adding to the uncertainty for businesses\" said City Index analyst Fiona Cincotta. \"Brexit tensions that have been building over the last couple of weeks with party defections and the formation of the group of independent MPs seem to have yielded some results.\" The stronger pound weighs on FTSE-listed multinationals whose earnings abroad are converted back into sterling. Adding upside to sterling was the announcement by opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn that his Labour Party would support a second referendum on leaving the bloc if its own plan for Brexit is not approved. In Washington Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell appeared to add weight to his earlier repetition that the US central bank will be \"patient\" before making any further changes in the benchmark borrowing rate. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Diabetics and insulin providers in Britain are stockpiling the precious medicine to avoid potential shortages in case Britain leaves the European Union without a deal in just over month\\'s time. \"I started about two months ago\" David Burns a 37-year-old teacher living in London told AFP. \"I used to pick up insulin once a month. Now I\\'m picking it up about once every two weeks and I am just going to keep doing this until I can be reassured that it is going to be OK. \"But it\\'s likely we are heading for a no-deal Brexit and our country is in a very precarious position.\" Many of Britain\\'s 3.7 million diabetics who include Prime Minister Theresa May depend almost entirely on insulin imports from continental Europe. The hormone which is usually produced by the pancreas helps diabetics regulate their blood-sugar levels. A no-deal Brexit would almost certainly mean re-establishing customs and health controls which could lead to delays at the border. London and Brussels have both said they want to avoid this scenario but nerves are fraying as the March 29 departure date looms. \"We definitely do hear that people are making sure that their stocks are a bit higher than usual\" Robin Hewings chief policy officer at Diabetes UK told AFP. \\'May disrupt medicines supply\\' Hewings played down fears of a \"national shortage\" but warned that there could be localised issues. Suppliers in Britain have tried to get ahead of the problem exceeding the government\\'s recommendation to have enough inventory to last six weeks. Novo Nordisk which supplies more than half of the insulin used in Britain has doubled its reserves. \"We will continue to build stock ahead of 29 March when we expect to have around two and a half times our normal stock levels (roughly 17 weeks) in readiness for a potential no-deal Brexit\" the group said. French group Sanofi which produces insulin near Frankfurt Germany has also stocked up on drugs in Britain including enough insulin to last 16 weeks. US firm Eli Lilly another insulin producer said it had \"done everything in its power to prepare for Brexit\" but warned that \"circumstances outside of our responsibility may disrupt medicines supply\". \"A no-deal Brexit would result in the UK\\'s complete and sudden disassociation from decades of partnership with the EU on medicines regulation and drug safety monitoring\" it added. \\'Not something I want to test\\' Diabetes UK and another group JDRF have called on the government to provide more details on its preparations in case of a no-deal. They point out that in addition to insulin people with diabetes use other drugs and imported products such as needles insulin pumps and devices used to measure blood glucose levels. The health ministry has sought to reassure those affected and has welcomed the efforts of the pharmaceutical industry. \"We are confident that if everyone does what they should do the supply of medicines will be uninterrupted in the event of a no-deal\" a ministry spokesman told AFP. The ministry\\'s plans include fast-track emergency medicine deliveries by sea and by air in case of congestion at the border. But not all patients are comforted by the government\\'s words. \"If I don\\'t have insulin then I would go immediately to hospital because you know I could be sick in a matter of days and dead in a matter of weeks\" said Burns. \"This is not something I want to test.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Saturday the government had \"no red lines\" in talks with the main opposition party to break the deadlock in parliament over Brexit. \"Our approach to these discussions with Labour is that we have no red lines\" he told reporters at a meeting of European finance ministers in Bucharest. \"We are expecting to exchange more texts with the Labour Party today so this is an ongoing process and I expect we will reach some form of agreement\" Hammond added. Senior ministers are negotiating with Labour leaders in a bid to find a compromise to end months of political crisis and allow Britain to leave the European Union smoothly after 46 years of membership.\\xa0 But after three days of discussions Labour said Friday it was \"disappointed\" by the failure to offer \"real change or compromise\" to Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s unpopular Brexit divorce deal. MPs have rejected her agreement finalised with European leaders last November three times delaying Britain\\'s original March 29 exit date and throwing the process into chaos. Ahead of an EU summit on Wednesday May was forced to ask for another extension until June 30 to prevent the country crashing out the bloc next Friday. However with European leaders growing increasingly impatient at the paralysis in Westminster they could offer just a shorter postponement -- or a longer period of up to a year. The other 27 EU nations must give unanimous backing to any deadline extension. Hammond who backed Remain in Britain\\'s 2016 referendum and is seen as favouring as soft a Brexit as possible urged his divided Conservative colleagues to show flexibility. \"We should be open to listen to suggestions that others have made and some people in the Labour Party are making other suggestions\" he said. Labour is pushing May to accept a much closer post-Brexit alliance with the EU that includes participation in a customs union. The prime ministers has previously dismissed the idea because it bars Britain from striking its own trade deals with global giants such as China and the United States. But after Brexit hardliners in her own party repeatedly refused to back her plan over fears it would keep the country too closely aligned with Europe she last week turned to Labour -- infuriating many Conservatives.\\xa0 Labour\\'s home affairs spokeswoman Diane Abbott said her party was engaged in the talks \"in good faith\" but May\\'s team appear unwilling to compromise. \"There is concern that the government doesn\\'t want to alter the political declaration\" she told the BBC referring to the part of May\\'s deal outlining the future relationship with the EU. \"The government perhaps has to show a little more flexibility than it seems to have done so far.\" Fisherman held hostage by militants drowns in escape bid \\'European Union\\' removed from UK passports despite Brexit turmoil \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Support for Scottish independence rose last month after British Prime Minister Theresa May came out in favour of Britain making a clean break with the European Union a BMG survey for Herald Scotland has shown. It indicated 49 percent of Scots now support independence - a 3 point rise from a previous poll - with 51 percent opposing it after \"don\\'t know\" votes are removed. However a majority - 56 percent to 44 percent - still oppose holding another independence vote before Britain leaves the EU. In 2014 Scots voted roughly 55 percent to 45 percent to remain in the United Kingdom. But last year\\'s Britain-wide vote to leave the EU changed the landscape. Scotland\\'s devolved parliament rejected May\\'s plans for how to exit the EU in a symbolic non-binding vote a demonstration of the divisions between London and Scotland when it comes to Brexit. A majority of Scots backed staying in the EU and the Scottish National Party (SNP) the biggest party in Scotland\\'s parliament has said that there should be another independence vote if its views on Brexit are rejected. Scottish Greens lawmaker Ross Greer who backs the devolved nationalist government on independence told Reuters on Monday that Scotland was almost certainly headed to a new independence referendum after the UK triggers the process to leave the European Union. A report by Dundee-based newspaper the Courier said that May believes Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is two weeks away from demanding a second referendum on independence. It said May is privately working a strategy to deal with this. Scotland has a population of around 5.3 million according to the last census slightly more than 8 percent of the United Kingdom\\'s population as a whole. It was an independent kingdom until merging into the UK with the Act of Union in 1707.\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Britain will urge the European Union tomorrow to show \"imagination\" in Brexit talks and help focus discussion on future ties rather than on a divorce settlement. Brexit minister David Davis will call on the EU to be more flexible in its approach at the start of negotiations with the bloc\\'s chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday -- the third round of talks which are likely to be largely technical. A government source said Britain would point to the papers it has published over the past two weeks on both the future relationship and the divorce to show how officials have been working \"diligently to inform the negotiations\". \"Now both sides must be flexible and willing to compromise when it comes to solving areas where we disagree\" the source said. \"As the EU itself has said the clock is ticking so neither side should drag its feet.\" READ: UK reveals its plans for breaking free of ECJ jurisdiction Britain has published papers on everything from future customs arrangements to data going beyond a brief set by the EU to first make progress on three priority areas -- the rights of expatriates Britain\\'s border with EU state Ireland and a financial settlement. British officials say they cannot make headway on those areas without looking at future ties arguing that what happens at the border with Northern Ireland depends largely on what kind of customs arrangement is agreed with the European Union. But the EU has stuck to its stance that \"sufficient progress\" must be made in those areas before moving on to any discussion of the future relationship. The new series of talks begin as Britain\\'s economy is starting to show the strain of last year\\'s vote to leave. After a prolonged period of relatively benign economic numbers following last year\\'s there are now signs of a potentially serious slow down -- including in household spending and business investment. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The British government pledged on Monday to ease the potential harm to more than 100000 companies that may have to pay sales tax upfront on goods imported from the European Union for the first time after Brexit. The changes included in a new taxation bill one of many Brexit laws passing through parliament have alarmed company bosses who said the move would create cashflow problems and increase the cost of doing business. \"It is an issue (for) which the government and the Treasury has sympathy\" Mel Stride a junior Treasury minister said during a debate in parliament. \"It is something that we will be closely looking at.\" Business groups have warned that consumers are likely to suffer higher prices and companies may have to take out costly bank or insurance backed guarantees if they are forced to pay the tax upfront. Any British company that imports goods ready for sale from the EU can currently register with the government to bring them in without paying so-called Value-Added Tax (VAT) upfront. They register the tax and it is only added to the price of the product whenever it is sold to the final customer. Unless the government negotiates a deal where Britain can remain part of the EU-VAT area companies may have to pay the tax when importing goods. Nicky Morgan chair of the Treasury committee said during the debate her committee is planning to investigate the issue. For some businesses \"finding upfront cash in order to pay for that would be a real problem\" she said. The Treasury said in a statement it recognised the cashflow benefits for companies under existing arrangements. \"The government will take this into account when considering potential changes following EU exit and will look at options to mitigate any cash flow impacts\" the statement said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Among the most attention-grabbing items on sale at this year\\'s UKIP conference in Birmingham on Friday were condoms in packets printed with an image of Farage eyebrow raised and the phrase \"For when you have a hard Brexit\" underneath. \"They\\'re one pound each or two pounds for four - at UKIP we like making deal so long as it\\'s a good deal\" said Sebastian Cheek the 20 year-old student who designed the packet and was selling 200 condoms to raise funds for the party\\'s youth wing. UKIP is seeking to revive its dwindling political influence at the annual party get-together. Its popularity collapsed following the 2016 vote to leave the European Union and several botched attempts to replace the talismanic Farage as leader. Farage remains a UKIP member but has tried to steer clear of the limelight to allow the party to develop a new identity - although no one appears to have told the party faithful snapping up the condoms and helping themselves to free framed photos of a grinning Farage standing with US President Donald Trump.

Maltese and Gozitans who do business or have commercial ties with the United Kingdom should know how and under which conditions Brexit was to take place for the sake of peace of mind and business continuity Nationalist Party leader Adrian Delia said on Thursday. Dr Delia who is attending the European People’s Party (EPP) summit in Brussels said that in spite of Wednesday’s vote of confidence in British Prime Minister Theresa May there\\xa0remained a number of questions which needed to be answered. On migration he said that irregular migration was one of the issues that mostly concerned European citizens. Malta he said needed to take a clear position where it continued to safeguard its frontiers and territory. Dr Delia said it was surreal how ministers were twisting the truth and conclusions of European international and Auditor General reports calling them a certificate of best practice when these clearly condemned the government. This was situation of concern for the Maltese because the damage being done to Malta’s reputation was badly affecting the country. The summit was also attended by EPP President Joseph Daul chairman Manfred Weber European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker European Council President Donald Tusk European Parliament President Antonio Tajani Brexit head negotiator Michel Barnier and other European leaders including German chancellor Angela Merkel. The summit started with a minute’s silence in remembrance of Tuesday’s victims of a shooting in Strasbourg. Dr Delia was accompanied by the Nationalist Party’s international secretary Roselyn Borg Knight. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 6th 09:36  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

After losing the most contentious referendum in British history James McGrory went for a drink in The Hope pub near London\\'s medieval meat market. Amid butchers in bloodied coats his dream of reversing Brexit seemed hopeless. Two years later with the country in crisis over how or whether to leave the European Union McGrory is feeling more confident that his campaign can help secure another referendum that he hopes would overturn the 2016 result. The idea of a second referendum has been gathering support from some senior British politicians and seems to have traction with sections of public opinion but the political situation is so uncertain that it is hard to say whether this will actually translate into another vote and when or how that might done or what question might be put. \"We have gone from being seen as a fringe view dismissed and laughed at to now being at the centre of the Brexit debate\" McGrory the 36-year-old campaign director of the People\\'s Vote campaign said in an interview. \"The odds are getting shorter every day that we get another referendum. All the momentum is with our campaign.\" Betting odds show there is a 43% probability of an EU referendum before 2020. Gamblers think there is a 55% probability that Britain does not leave as planned on March 29. Opinion polls suggest there has been a slight shift by voters towards remaining in the EU but the public remains broadly split down the middle. It remains unclear how exactly a second vote might be called though some lawmakers have drafted a detailed roadmap setting out possible legislative routes to another referendum. Meanwhile campaigners for another vote are busy lobbying parliament and trying to drum up public support with rallies and on social and mainstream media. They note Prime Minister Theresa May has included their desired outcome as one of three options facing the country: her deal no deal or reversing Brexit. U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan said the chances of Britain calling off Brexit had increased after a string of parliamentary defeats for May cast new doubt over her plan to quit the bloc. Vote reversed? Turning Brexit upside down would mark one of the most extraordinary reversals in modern British history and likely alienate the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU. The path to a new referendum is fraught with crisis. May\\'s Brexit deal has first to be voted down in parliament on December 11. Second her government has to endure an attempt by the opposition Labour Party to topple it and then call a national election. With the clock ticking down to March 29 and financial markets pricing in what would be a potentially disorderly exit McGrory and his campaigners hope Britain\\'s politicians will accept they have come to a dead end and throw the question back to voters. David Lammy a Labour lawmaker said that after parliament fails to reach a consensus it will reluctantly agree to hold another referendum as the best among a limited number of escape routes to avoid a potentially chaotic exit. \"We will probably end up going round and round in circles and when politics is stuck and cannot reach compromise then the only way to get out of that is to go back to the people\" Lammy told Reuters. Lammy said that the situation may resemble Charles Dickens\\' novel Bleak House which revolves around a will settlement that has been in court so long that few of the participants can remember the original arguments. A new referendum can only be called if it is approved by parliament. This could be either put forward by the government or by rebels. Pipe dream? The hurdles to another referendum are high. Both major political parties are committed to leaving the EU in accordance with the 2016 referendum. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn who voted against membership of the European Community in a 1975 referendum has indicated he is not keen on another referendum now. His party has said they will only support another referendum if the deal is voted down and they fail to force a general election. Some trade union leaders opposed another referendum because they feel it would be seen as betrayal by millions of Brexit supporters in Labour\\'s electoral heartlands. Brexit supporters say the 2016 vote must be respected. \"It is wholly dangerous for us to turn to the people now and say \\'You let us down. You got it wrong\\'\" said Nigel Evans a Conservative MP. Even if parliament did agree in principle to a second referendum Britain would then have to ask for an extension to its timetable for leaving the EU to allow enough time for a campaign probably by withdrawing its Article 50 departure notification. On Tuesday just hours before a five-day parliamentary debate on May\\'s deal an adviser to the European Court of Justice said Britain could revoke its formal divorce notice. The court is due to rule on Dec. 10. Even if there was a change in mood there would be controversy about what the question would be and whether another referendum would deliver a different result. Underdog? After the failure of the 2016 campaign pro-Europeans turned on each other and blamed what they saw as the chicanery of their opponents on the Brexit campaign. But in the wake of their defeat a small group of influential politicians journalists and campaigners started to hatch a plan to keep Britain inside the club it joined in 1973. They had to face unpalatable truths. Their 2016 campaign had been riven with rivalry damaged by its association with then-Prime Minister David Cameron underperformed on social media and was cast by opponents as the voice of the establishment arguing for the status quo. In recent months pro-EU campaigners have been feeling more optimistic. In October the People\\'s Vote organised a march of almost 700000 people through London demanding another vote. \"The tables have turned\" said McGrory. \"We are the underdog. We are the scrappy campaign that is doing things a bit differently.\" In the last month two ministers have resigned calling for another referendum. Three of the four former British prime ministers still alive - John Major Tony Blair and Gordon Brown - have also said a second referendum is the way to resolve the crisis. The mood in the headquarters of the People\\'s Vote in Millbank Tower close to parliament is bullish. Young people examine charts of target audiences and organise an advertising blitz to convince lawmakers to block the government\\'s deal. \"If anyone thinks Brexit is a done deal they should be ready for another surprise\" McGrory said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

French president Emanuel Macron has summed up the EU\\'s reaction to the latest Brexit developments in widely-praised remarks seen as \\'hitting the nail on the head\\'. Macron made his remarks at the end of a seven-hour town hall meeting in Normandy in which he outlined what he thinks will be the UK\\'s next steps. The first option he said was a no-deal exit. This scared everyone but the first losers would be the British people. They would have to renegotiate a future relationship without any transition period in a context where for example 70 per cent of the supermarket goods came from Europe.

Britain\\'s Opposition Labour Party has tabled a Commons amendment to the government\\'s EU withdrawal deal which it claims prevents the chaos of no deal and includes the option of a second referendum. The amendment was presented as MPs derided Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Plan B announced on Monday and a report revealed that cross-Channel freight trade could collapse by between 75% and 87% for six months in the event of no deal. Mrs May on Monday said she could not guarantee a no-deal pointing out that there would be no-deal if no agreement was reached on a withdrawal plan or if Brexit was dropped.\\xa0 The secret report based on estimates by the UK Border Force was revealed by Sky News and showed the chaos which would result in case of a no-deal as customs checks were imposed.\\xa0 \"The reasonable worst case flow through the Short Straits is reduced to between 13% and 25% of current capacity for a period of between 3-6 months\" the report said. \"The French will apply at least the legal minimum of third country customs controls on all goods and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks on specified food and agricultural products. This includes the imposition of 100% customs documents checks. \"Our amendment will allow MPs to vote on options to end this Brexit deadlock and prevent the chaos of a no deal\" said Jeremy Corbyn. \"It is time for Labour\\'s alternative plan to take centre stage while keeping all options on the table including the option of a public vote.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

More than 40 companies last year moved or said they would move their operations from Britain to the Netherlands in response to Brexit uncertainties Dutch authorities reported on Saturday. The combined moves of 42 companies will translate into the shift of just under 2000 jobs and of €291 million in investments the Dutch agency for foreign investment said in a statement. Most of the companies are British but some are from Asia or the US. The Dutch government welcomed the figures with Economy Minister Eric Wiebes saying that \"due to the growing international uncertainty surrounding Brexit and changing global trade policies the importance of a good Dutch business climate for all of us is continually increasing\". The list includes Japanese investment bank Norinchukin media company TVT Media financial services providers MarketAxess and Azimo and maritime insurer UK P&I the agency said. Some of the companies were also looking at moving some operations elsewhere in the European Union including Germany France and Ireland it said. In addition to relocations by corporates the European Medicines Agency (EMA) an EU agency has said that it will move from London to Amsterdam as it cannot legally remain in a non-EU country. Britain is to leave the European Union on March 29 and uncertainty about the shape of any agreement with Brussels by that date has created unease in the business community with many British and multinational companies having already announced moves to elsewhere in the EU. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

It cheered those seeking a soft Brexit while enraging Leavers in her own party. May claimed she was forced to seek a cross-party compromise after failing three times to get her withdrawal agreement with the EU agreed in the British parliament. Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers in the European Research Group (ERG) together with the 10 MPs of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had voted with the opposition to defeat the deal May had negotiated. In looking for a cross-party solution May hopes to sidestep the ERG and the DUP. Yet there are doubts over whether anything will come of the May-Corbyn talks. Labour has its own Brexit divisions with Corbyn an old-style Bennite eurosceptic leading a party whose membership is strongly pro-Remain. Labour supports a customs union with the EU but one in which the UK would have a say. As an actual working policy that is unrealistic. But as a party-management tool it has successfully held Labour’s different Brexit tribes together by avoiding the need to take a hard decision on a genuine policy. Negotiating with May risks causing a split between those Labour MPs who would back staying in the EU’s customs union (without a full say for the UK) and those for whom only remaining via a second referendum will suffice. While many Labour MPs representing Remain-voting constituencies in London and the South support a second referendum others in Leave-voting seats in the Midlands and the North do not. Officially Labour backs a second referendum but Corbyn has done little to advance the cause. Consequently there is an uneasy stalemate inside the party. The May-Corbyn talks could turn that stalemate into open warfare. While the shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry wants any deal that emerged to include a second referendum with “Remain” on the ballot others in the shadow cabinet such as the party chairman Ian Lavery are hostile. A cross-party deal would moreover be limited to the government’s non-binding political declaration which sets out the UK’s ambitions for its future relationship with the EU. May’s legally binding withdrawal agreement is not up for negotiation. The risk for Corbyn would be that he splits his own party and takes co-ownership of an unpopular withdrawal agreement. Any deal that emerged from the May-Corbyn talks would aggravate Labour’s internal Brexit divisions. For that reason there must be a strong chance that the talks will fail. If the talks do fail there could be a third round of indicative parliamentary votes on Brexit to settle the matter. Neither previous round delivered a majority for any option but if there were a run-off system of ballots a winner would emerge. On the basis of the second round of votes the most popular options were a customs union single-market membership (“common market 2.0”) and a second referendum – although May’s negotiated political declaration with the EU would join any third round of votes. At this point May’s problem with her own party becomes clear. In the second round of indicative votes Conservative MPs overwhelmingly opposed a customs union (236 against with 37 in favour) “common market 2.0” (228 against 33 in favour) and a second referendum (253 against 15 in favour). The DUP also opposed all three proposals. Support came primarily from opposition parties. It stretches credulity to believe there will be a huge U-turn by Conservative MPs. If May tried to adopt any of them it would be in the face of large-scale and intense Tory opposition. Parliamentary votes on Brexit One option that May seems to have ruled out is a no-deal Brexit. Yet that is precisely the direction that Conservative MPs have increasingly been heading. In the first set of indicative votes 157 Tories backed a no-deal Brexit – over half of the parliamentary party. Reports emerged this week of a letter to May signed by 170 Conservative MPs calling for no deal. If May tries to force through a soft Brexit or a second referendum on Labour votes she could catastrophically split the Conservative Party just as Robert Peel did over the Corn Laws in the 1840s. An alternative to a Brexit deal now is a long extension to Article 50. That also faces Conservative opposition. Fully 188 Tory MPs opposed the prime minister’s motion last month calling for just a short extension to Article 50 with the motion passed on Labour votes. Yet the likely success of Labour MP Yvette Cooper’s bill which dramatically navigated the Commons by 313 votes to 312 on its third reading would compel the prime minister to seek an extension if the withdrawal agreement is not passed by Exit Day on April 12. Parliament would decide what length of delay to request. The EU has most recently been indicating that it would be open to a year-long extension although May’s latest request is to extend just to June 30. The EU would require a reason for granting a long delay – a “new political event” as it has previously described it. That could mean either a referendum or an election. Tory MPs are strongly opposed to a referendum and most will be aghast at the thought of May leading them into another election after she lost the Conservatives their majority in 2017. The party would have to decide whether to include the withdrawal agreement in its manifesto. If it did scores of Conservative candidates could end up signing pledges never to vote for it in its current form. May’s cross-party switch might have appeared a bold judgement call. In reality it was a desperate move that prioritises her withdrawal agreement over party unity. But Tory MPs are rapidly running out of patience and the government appears on the brink. There is talk of imminent mass resignations by ministers and even the prospect of some ERG MPs opposing the government in a confidence motion. There is a strong sense that we are approaching the moment when something has to give.

Updated - Former UK Prime Ministers Sir John Major and Tony Blair have warned that a vote to leave the EU would be a \"historic mistake\" which could threaten Northern Ireland\\'s hard-fought peace process. The former adversaries shared a platform at the Ulster University\\'s Magee campus in Londonderry and warned that Brexit could lead to the break-up of the UK. Sir John said: \"I believe it would be an historic mistake to do anything that has any risk of destabilising the complicated and multi-layered constitutional settlement that underpins stability in Northern Ireland.\" Both men played crucial roles in the Northern Ireland peace process and Sir John warned that the \"wrong outcome on June 23 could \"tear apart the UK\". He added: \"If we throw the pieces of the constitutional jigsaw up in to the air no one can be certain where they might land.\" Mr Blair hit out at the Leave campaign claiming it puts an \"ideological fixation\" with Brexit ahead of the damage it would cause. He said: \"I say don\\'t take a punt on these people. Don\\'t let them take risks with Northern Ireland\\'s future. Don\\'t let them undermine our United Kingdom. \"We understand that although today Northern Ireland is more stable and more prosperous than ever that stability is poised on carefully-constructed foundations. \"And so we are naturally concerned at the prospect of anything that could put those foundations at risk.\" He also spoke of the potential damage to British-Irish relations if the UK withdrew from Europe. Former US president Bill Clinton whose 1995 visit to Northern Ireland was seen as a crucial moment in the peace process said he was worried about the potential impact of Brexit on the province. Writing in the New Statesman magazine Mr Clinton said: \"I was honoured to support the peace process in Northern Ireland. It has benefited from the UK\\'s membership in the European Union and I worry that the future prosperity and peace of Northern Ireland could be jeopardised if Britain withdraws.\" The former president who worked with Sir John and Mr Blair on the peace process added: \"Transatlantic co-operation is essential and that co-operation is strongest when Europe is united ... I hope you will stay.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 6th 09:36  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The number of people claiming unemployment benefit in Britain unexpectedly fell in July despite the shock to the economy caused by the Brexit vote official data showed yesterday. Claimants fell by 8600 in the month compared with an increase of 900 in June the Office for National Statistics said. Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected the number of benefit claimants – which is considered to be a potential early warning sign of an economic downturn – to rise by 9500 as employers res\\xadponded to the uncertainty caused by the decision by voters to leave the European Union. Yesterday’s figures represented the first official measure of Britain’s labour market since the June 23 referendum. A survey published on August 5 by a body representing the recruitment industry had suggested employers cut hiring in July as the number of permanent jobs placed by staffing firms fell at the fastest pace since 2009. The Bank of England expects unemployment to rise sharply as a result of the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. It cut interest rates to just 0.25 per cent earlier this month and took other measures to cushion the economy. Samuel Tombs an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics said before yesterday’s data release that the claimant count would need to be about 80000 higher on average in the third quarter than in the previous three-month period to signal a recession requiring average month-to-month rises of 40000 claimants. The July data was measured on July 14 three weeks after the referendum meaning it might not reflect the full extent of any post-Brexit fall in hiring economists said prior to the release. The ONS also said the number of vacancies in the three-month period to the end of July fell by 7000 from the three months to the end of April to 741000. Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said a decline of more 20000 vacancies would send a recession signal. Much of the ONS data covered the labour market in the run-up to the referendum. Britain’s unemployment rate held steady in the three months to June at 4.9 per cent as expected in a poll of economists. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Europe wants to \"write a future chapter\" after Britain\\'s vote to leave the EU and focus on common defence security and economic growth Italian premier Matteo Renzi has said. At the end of a mini-summit with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande Mr Renzi said improved security and intelligence sharing is an \"absolute priority\" for a Europe confronting Islamic extremist violence.  Mr Hollande stressed in particular the need for common European defence efforts after a string of deadly attacks in France and other European countries. The three leaders held a press conference aboard the Italian aircraft carrier Garibaldi which is co-ordinating the EU\\'s Mediterranean migrant rescue operation after paying tribute to one of the founding fathers of European unity on the island of Ventotene. Standing silently together the trio placed three bouquets of blue and yellow flowers - the colours of the European Union - on the simple white marble tombstone of Altiero Spinelli in the cemetery on Ventotene. Spinelli along with another intellectual confined to Ventotene in the 1940s by Italy\\'s fascist rulers co-wrote the Ventotene Manifesto which called for a federation of European states to counter the nationalism that had led Europe to war. The document is considered the inspiration for European federalism. Mr Renzi invited his French and German counterparts to Ventotene to remind Europe of its founding ideals as the EU forges ahead after Britain\\'s vote to leave. They then moved on to the Garibaldi. Ahead of the summit Mr Renzi wrote of the venues: \"Two symbols in one: idealistic values and concrete commitment. \"We want that the Europe after Brexit - the Europe hit in its heart by terrorism - will relaunch the powerful ideals of unity and peace freedom and dreams dialogue and identity.\" For Ms Merkel the visit to Ventotene marked the start of a string of meetings with other EU leaders to discuss the post-Brexit EU.

As part of a \"phased approach\" Britain would just have to show \"sufficient progress\" on its divorce settlement in a first phase of negotiations and EU states could release a lock and agree to launch trade talks in a second phase. But that concession to Theresa May two days after she triggered a two-year countdown to withdrawal was accompanied by elements in the draft circulated by EU summit chair Donald Tusk that the British prime minister may find less palatable. They include an insistence that during a transition period likely to follow Britain\\'s departure in 2019 and before a free trade pact can be finalised the British must accept EU rules including budget contributions and judicial oversight that are some of the main reasons a majority voted for Brexit last June. They include an insistence that during a transition period likely to follow Britain\\'s departure in 2019 and before a free trade pact can be finalised the British must accept EU rules If Britain remains a part of the EU single market for a time after Brexit it would also have to respect all \"four freedoms\" which would mean accepting free immigration from the continent. The draft guidelines seen by Reuters after European Council President Tusk distributed them to the 27 other governments in the bloc on Friday may be somewhat revised over the next month before being endorsed by the 27 leaders at a summit on April 29. Among other elements in the eight-page document is a priority to settle legal uncertainty for EU expatriates living on either side of the new EU-UK frontier. It says rights acquired before a cutoff on the day Brexit takes effect should be retained. Responding to May\\'s warning that she might prefer to walk away without a deal the EU should be ready for such an outcome but will the document says work to ensure that does not happen as it would be in the interests of neither side. EU Council President Donald Tusk holds British Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit letter in Brussels. JUNE TALKS The guidelines will form the basis of a mandate for chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier. He expects to launch negotiations in early June giving him about 16 months to conclude the basics of a withdrawal treaty that can then be ratified by lawmakers on both sides in time for Brexit on March 29 2019. \"In these negotiations the Union will act as one. It will be constructive throughout and will strive to find an agreement. This is in the best interest of both sides\" the draft says. \"The Union will work hard to achieve that outcome but it will prepare itself to be able to handle the situation also if the negotiations were to fail.\" If the 27 leaders saw \"sufficient progress\" towards a withdrawal treaty then negotiations on a future trading relationship could start Over the past nine months EU leaders and officials have resisted British calls for immediate negotiations on a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement to replace Britain\\'s lost access to the EU single market by ensuring low or zero tariffs and harmonising regulations to encourage trade in services. Many have insisted Britain must first make good on a divorce settlement that will include it settling outstanding financial commitments - the EU has advanced a ballpark figure of €60 billion -\\xa0agreeing new border arrangements and clarifying the rights of EU expatriates on either side of the new frontier. Legally a trade deal cannot be signed until Britain has left and many on both sides believe that going by typical times to negotiate such accords it will take several years beyond 2019 before one is in place. In her trigger letter to Tusk May called for trade talks to move ahead \"alongside\" the divorce. In his draft guidelines Tusk proposed that if the 27 leaders saw \"sufficient progress\" towards a withdrawal treaty then negotiations on a future trading relationship could start. Some governments are firmer than others in refusing trade talks from the start so the guidelines could change. And there could be difficulties for Britain later in securing the agreement of the 27 as a group that progress was sufficient. The guidelines put no timeframe on how long a transition between Brexit and a new relationship should last. Many EU officials believe it could be between two and five years. But during that time when May hopes to win an election in 2020 where she will want to show she has delivered Brexit the EU will insist Britain should remain subject to the EU\\'s \"regulatory budgetary supervisory and enforcement instruments and structures\" -- effectively accepting existing EU rules and their enforcement by the European Court of Justice. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Interviewed on the BBC Newsnight programme a year after Britain voted to leave the European Union Andrea Leadsom was asked why the country lacked a coherent Brexit strategy and a stable government. \"You\\'ve got a negotiating position which is completely unclear ... we\\'ve got a political system which is unstable many believe our economy is unfair living standards are falling what can you point to now and say that\\'s going well?\" presenter Emily Maitlis had asked. Leadsom the leader of the House of Commons said the country needed to pull together. Andrea Leadsom was not happy about the BBC presenter\\'s line of questioning. Photo: Reuters \"It would be helpful if broadcasters were willing to be a bit patriotic. The country took a decision this government is determined to deliver on that decision.\" Britain launched its negotiations to leave the EU this week led by Prime Minister Theresa May who has been stripped of her authority by a failure to win a majority in a June 8 election she did not need to call. More than two weeks after the vote May\\'s Conservatives have still not managed to secure a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party a small Northern Irish group whose lawmakers will be needed to get legislation passed through parliament. Tim Farron the outgoing leader of the small pro-EU Liberal Democrats party said Leadsom should apologise for her \"sinister\" comments. \"This isn\\'t a George Orwell book\" he said. Leadsom sparked uproar in the weeks after the Brexit vote when running to be leader of the Conservative party she said the fact she was a mother meant she had a greater stake in the future than her childless rival May. Leadsom later apologised and withdrew from the race leaving May to be appointed prime minister. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 6th 09:36  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The offer which British newspapers valued at around €50 billion reflected the bulk of outstanding EU demands that include London paying a share of post-Brexit EU spending on commitments made before Britain leaves in March 2019 as well as funding of EU staff pensions for decades to come. A British government official said they \"do not recognise\" this account of the talks going on ahead of a visit by Prime Minister Theresa May to Brussels this coming Monday. €50 billion reflects the bulk of outstanding EU demands that include London paying a share of post-Brexit EU spending on commitments made before Britain leaves in March 2019 as well as funding of EU staff pensions for decades to come EU officials close to the negotiations stressed that work was still continuing ahead of May\\'s talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and his chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. But EU diplomats briefed on progress said the British offer was promising and that on the financial settlement the two sides were as one said \"close to a deal\". Nonetheless others cautioned that Britain had yet to make a fully committed offer and that essential agreement from the other 27 member states could not yet be taken for granted. The EU set the condition of \"significant progress\" on three key elements of a withdrawal treaty before it would accede to London\\'s request for negotiations on a free trade pact that could keep business flowing after Brexit in 16 months. It set a deadline of Monday for that progress to be made if EU leaders were to give a green light at a summit on December 14-15. On the issue of the rights of EU citizens in Britain EU negotiators are still pressing Britain to accept that European judges should have a final say on enforcing those rights. If the financial settlement which many British businesses have argued May should make in order to avoid a disruptive \"cliff edge\" departure from the single market is forthcoming the thorniest outstanding issue is that of the Irish border. Britain has yet to satisfy EU - including Irish - demands that it clarify how it would avoid a \"hard border\" with customs posts on land between Northern Ireland and the EU \"Ireland remains the most difficult issue\" a senior EU diplomat said after Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar avoided a disruptive snap election when his deputy resigned on Tuesday at the insistence of the party propping up his minority government. Britain has yet to satisfy EU - including Irish - demands that it clarify how it would avoid a \"hard border\" with customs posts on land between Northern Ireland and the EU. Many fear that would disturb the fragile peace in the British province. On the Brexit bill Juncker has estimated Britain would owe roughly €60 billion. EU officials say Brussels is willing to work with May to massage those figures in order to help her win backing from hardline Brexit supporters who have in the past insisted that Britain owes Brussels nothing. Britain\\'s Financial Times said London agreed to assume liabilities worth up to €100 billion but said net payments over many decades could fall to less than half that amount. The European Commission declined to comment. Britain\\'s Brexit ministry said \"intensive talks\" were continuing and the two sides were trying to find a way to \"build on recent momentum in the talks\" to take them to the next stage. Sterling rallied around 1% against the US dollar as investors took the reports as a sign that the risk of Britain leaving the EU without a deal which is widely seen as damaging to the economy had diminished. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Interviewed by The Big Issue magazine Norton said he feels the country is \"spiralling out of control\". He said: \"My heart breaks every morning. \"I get a Brexit update and like a lot of people I am slightly addicted in a perverse way to following this story. I digest everything. \"I feel like as an actor if you have a little bit of a voice you have a responsibility to use that voice. \"To a point. But every time I tweet about that I get people who are really angry \\'just stick to your job you are not a politician\\'.

On speculation that he might replace Daniel Craig as James Bond he said: \"It is such an iconic role and it is so important in this country. \"There are not many people you will find who don\\'t care about Bond.

In a significant move Britain proposed more flexibility for expatriates’ freedom of movement by offering EU citizens in the UK “guaranteed rights of return”. This means those lawfully resident in Britain before Brexit would be able to leave and freely return at a later date. Previous proposals only allowed a two-year window for this right. The ball is now in the EU27’s court to agree on reciprocal rights for Britons within the bloc. As things stand a UK national resident in Malta for example would be unable to relocate to Spain from April 2019 without having to apply for visas and permits as a non-EU citizen. Both sides confirmed they will carry on reimbursing certain healthcare costs for citizens under the EHIC (European Health Insurance Card) and S1 schemes. They also agreed to continue yearly inflation increases in State pension payments for nationals living abroad. One area still to be resolved is the potential ‘cliff-edge’ for British personal pension and insurance payments. When current EU ‘passporting’ rights for UK financial services companies expire on Brexit day these providers cannot legally make payments to Britons abroad. However with both sides having a mutual financial interest in resolving this issue it is likely to be addressed early in future negotiations. A former ‘red line’ area for Britain has been how much influence the European courts should have over UK law after Brexit. The EU has maintained that EU citizens must continue to be protected by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) while living in the UK post-Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May initially insisted that the UK would “take back control of our laws” post-Brexit and hold exclusive authority within its borders. However she has now offered more flexibility by signalling a future role for the ECJ in settling disputes on British soil. Crucially she has also offered to incorporate legal protections for EU citizens into UK law to ensure Parliament cannot restrict these rights. Long an issue of contention between the two parties the Prime Minister has now confirmed that Britain will pay its financial dues until 2020 reassuring the EU27 that they will not have to pay more or receive less as a result of the UK’s exit. However the actual figure required to meet these promises is unclear. So far she has only agreed to pay a divorce bill of around €20 billion up to 2020 falling short of the estimated €50-€100 billion payment expected by the EU. In her speech in Florence in September the Prime Minister requested a two-year transition period for Britain’s exit. She pledged that Britain would continue to follow EU rules until 2021 – including freedom of movement and paying into EU coffers – in return for uninterrupted access to the single market. The transition period is expected to be considered in the EU summit later this month where the EU27 will discuss whether ‘sufficient progress’ has been made to move negotiations beyond specifically divorce-related issues. Britain’s proposals have been welcomed as “a step forward” by EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. However he suggested “it will take weeks or maybe even months” before they can move onto the next phase of negotiation topics including trade arrangements. Britain has now made concessions in three key areas – accepting free movement of EU citizens paying its share of EU bills and maintaining the legal authority of the ECJ – which is widely seen as a positive step towards securing mutual agreement. Although there is still a long way to go Britons living in Malta can find reassurances here especially regarding healthcare and State pension payments. Amid so much future uncertainty however it is important to understand how you could be affected and be as prepared as you can possibly be.

Photo: Reuters  Brexit Secretary David Davis starts negotiations in Brussels today that will set the terms on which Britain leaves the European Union and determine its relationship with the continent for generations to come. Almost a year to the day since Britons shocked themselves and their neighbours by voting on June 23 to cut loose from their main trading partner and nearly three months since Prime Minister Theresa May locked them into a two-year countdown to Brexit in March 2019 almost nothing about the future is clear. Even May\\'s own immediate political survival is in doubt 10 days after she lost her majority in an election. Davis who unlike May has long campaigned to leave the EU will meet chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier a former French minister at the European Commission\\'s Berlaymont headquarters at 11am (0900 GMT). They are due to give a joint news conference after talks among their teams lasting seven hours. Officials on both sides play down expectations for what can be achieved in one day. EU diplomats hope this first meeting and a Brussels summit on Thursday and Friday where May will encounter - but not negotiate with - fellow EU leaders can improve the atmosphere after some spiky exchanges. \"Now the hard work begins\" Davis said adding he wanted a deal that worked for both sides. \"These talks will be difficult at points but we will be approaching them in a constructive way.\" Barnier a keen mountaineer spent the weekend in his native Alps \"to draw the strength and energy needed for long walks\". Davis\\'s agreement to Monday\\'s agenda led some EU officials to believe that May\\'s government may at last coming around to Brussels\\' view of how negotiations should be run. Sounding conciliatory Britain\\'s Boris Johnson said as he arrived at a meeting with fellow EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg that he looked forward to \"a happy revolution\" in relations that would be good for Britain and the rest of Europe. \"The most important thing I think now is for us to ... think about the new partnership the deep and special partnership that we want to build with our friends\" said Johnson who campaigned in last year\\'s referendum to leave the EU. David Davis will spearhead the UK\\'s negotiating efforts. Photo: Reuters WHICH BREXIT? May\\'s election debacle has revived feuding over Europe among Conservatives that her predecessor David Cameron hoped to end by calling the referendum and leaves EU leaders unclear on her plan for a \"global Britain\" which most of them regard as pure folly. While \"Brexiteers\" have strongly backed May\\'s proposed clean break with the single market and customs union finance minister Philip Hammond and others have this month echoed calls by businesses for less of a \"hard Brexit\" and retaining closer customs ties. With discontent in europhile Scotland and troubled Northern Ireland which faces a new EU border across the divided island Brexit poses new threats to the integrity of the United Kingdom. It will test the ingenuity of thousands of public servants racing against the clock to untangle 44 years of EU membership before Britain is out 649 days from now on March 30 2019. For the officials sitting down on Monday at least on the EU side a major worry is Britain crashing out into a limbo with no deal. For that reason Brussels wants as a priority to guarantee rights for 3 million EU citizens in Britain and be paid tens of billions of euros it says London will owe on its departure. With a further million British expatriates in the EU May too wants a deal on citizens\\' rights though the two sides are some way apart. Agreeing to pay a \"Brexit bill\" may be more inflammatory. Brussels is also resisting British demands for immediate talks on a future free trade arrangement. The EU insists that should wait until an outline agreement on divorce terms ideally by the end of this year. In any case EU officials say London no longer seems sure of what trade arrangements it will ask for. But Union leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron are also determined not to make concessions to Britain that might encourage others to follow. When 52 percent of British voters opted for Brexit some feared for the survival of a Union battered by the euro crisis and divided in its response to chaotic immigration. The election of the fervently europhile Macron and his party\\'s sweep of the French parliament on Sunday has revived optimism in Brussels. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain said on Monday it could not agree a divorce deal with the European Union without a framework pact on future relations throwing down the gauntlet to the bloc which also says it cannot move on talks until London does. Both sides are eyeing significant progress at an October 17-18 summit in Brussels but in different sequences - Prime Minister Theresa May wants to see the EU\\'s proposal for post-Brexit ties while the EU seeks a new offering from her on the Irish border. What is up in the air is timing - who plays their hand first and after several days of positive noises about movement at the next summit both sides are now tempering expectations. May\\'s spokesman repeated Britain\\'s line on Monday that Brussels should budge first and that \"there can be no withdrawal agreement without a precise future framework\". \"There\\'s a difference between people talking optimistically about a deal and a deal including both the withdrawal agreement and the future framework actually being agreed\" he said. The 27 remaining members of the EU might delay work on fleshing out their proposal for strong trade ties after Brexit and will instead focus on their own preparations this week including contingencies for a \"no-deal\" scenario - given the profound divisions within May\\'s camp over the terms of Brexit. Negotiations on ending four decades of Britain\\'s membership in the EU have entered their final stage more than two years after Britons voted narrowly for Brexit in a referendum. Top EU officials sounded upbeat last week about chances for a withdrawal deal as soon as next week\\'s summit. But London has yet to present in writing a new proposal for the biggest hurdle in talks now - how to avoid extensive post-Brexit checks along the 500 km of border between EU member state Ireland and Britain\\'s Northern Ireland province that will become the only EU-UK land frontier. EU officials and diplomats say the bloc will not put forward its proposal for future trade before reaching an agreement with Britain on an emergency fix that would keep the Irish border open - preserving a key aspect of a 1998 peace treaty that ended decades of sectarian bloodshed - regardless of how Brexit goes. \"Joint priority: ensuring the orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom to protect the rights of citizens investments and geographic indication (locally made products protected by EU law)\" chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Monday after meeting Italian prime minister. \"This is the basis of trust for an ambitious future economic and strategic partnership (with Britain).\" But Britain wants Brussels to first propose its vision of a future trade relationship. \"There remain big issues to work through\" May\\'s spokesman said. \"CARROT AND STICK\" Given May\\'s struggles in swinging her divided Conservatives behind her negotiating approach any final withdrawal agreement may well have to wait until a special EU summit in mid-November. Barnier was to present his \"Outline of New Relationship with the UK\" at the bloc\\'s executive European Commission on Wednesday. But EU diplomats and officials said on Monday the focus of their session would instead be on the EU\\'s own Brexit preparations including for a \"no-deal\" outcome. That could upset London by offering up dire examples of the potential collapse in transport and other economic ties in case the sides fail to agree on a managed divorce - although May\\'s government has itself released reports attesting to the likely disruptions of Britain crashing out of the EU. \"It\\'s a carrot-and-stick approach - we are trying to push them into a deal\" a senior EU diplomat said of the change of tone from talking up progress last week to returning this week to no-deal preparations. The EU insist Britain come to terms on its withdrawal treaty notably now on the Irish border \"backstop\" before Barnier enters into talks on a future trading relationship. The bloc\\'s negotiators believe abandoning this sequencing would allow Britain to stall on the Irish issue. They are only expected to present to member states their outlines for future ties early next week. London on the other hand has long been keen to do withdrawal and subsequent trade deals in parallel arguing that the solution on Ireland lies in future smooth EU-UK trade. Barnier\\'s boss European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker acknowledged at the weekend that it was hard to keep the two issues - Ireland and future trade - strictly separate. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters/Fabrizio Bensch.  German leader Angela Merkel ruled out further negotiations on Brexit on Tuesday but said efforts were being made to give Britain reassurances after Prime Minister Theresa May abruptly pulled a parliamentary vote at home because she faced defeat. With less than four months left until the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on March 29 May\\'s Brexit deal is floundering opening up prospects that run the gamut from a disorderly no-deal divorce to calling Brexit off. A day after pulling the vote in the face of ridicule from lawmakers May rushed to The Hague for breakfast with Dutch Prime Minister\\xa0 Mark Rutte and then to Berlin to meet Chancellor Merkel before a trip to Brussels. The message from the EU was clear: it will give assurances about how it will interpret the exit treaty but will not countenance reopening the text itself. In rainy Berlin a hitch with May\\'s car door briefly trapped her inside delaying her red carpet handshake with Merkel. According to two sources Merkel told her own German conservative parliamentary group on Tuesday that there would be no further negotiations on Brexit but efforts were being made to give Britain reassurances. May had informed Merkel that the deal would have been voted down and that it was in nobody\\'s interest for Britain to leave with no accord the sources said. \"The deal we achieved is the best possible. It\\'s the only deal possible. There is no room whatsoever for renegotiation\" European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said in an address to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. The British parliament will get its vote before Jan. 21 May\\'s spokeswoman said. If there is no satisfactory deal by then parliament will still be given a debate on the issue. The British pound which has lost 25 cents against the U.S. dollar since the 2016 referendum was down 0.5 percent at $1.2501 falling after a Sky news reporter said a vote of confidence in May\\'s leadership was about to be triggered. IRISH BORDER The most contentious issue has been the Irish \"backstop\" an insurance policy that would keep Britain in a customs union with the EU in the absence of a better way to avoid border checks between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. May\\'s critics say it could leave Britain subject to EU rules indefinitely. Juncker said neither side intended for the backstop ever to take effect but it had to be part of the deal just in case. As investors and allies tried to work out the ultimate destination for the world\\'s fifth-largest economy rebel lawmakers in May\\'s party said she had to go. \"If we can\\'t go forwards with her deal ... then I\\'m afraid the only way to change the policy is to change the prime minister and I really think it\\'s her duty to go\" Brexit-supporting Conservative lawmaker Steve Baker said. A confidence vote is triggered if 48 Conservatives write letters demanding one to the chairman of the party\\'s so-called 1922 committee Graham Brady. A Sky news reporter said some sources were confident that the 48 letters had been submitted but that Brady would not announce it while May was abroad. However other senior political editors said the threshold had not been reached. With little hope of substantial changes from the EU the options open to Britain range from a chaotic Brexit with no deal to risking the wrath of pro-Brexit voters by calling the whole thing off. Both May\\'s ruling Conservatives and the main opposition Labour Party have pledged to implement the results of the 2016 referendum in which British voters backed exiting the EU 52 percent to 48 percent. But a rising number of backbench lawmakers along with three of the four living former prime ministers say the only way out of the impasse may be a new referendum with an option to stay. A European court ruled this week that Britain could abandon Brexit with no consequences up until the moment it finally leaves. Former Prime Minister John Major said on Tuesday that Britain must revoke its divorce notice immediately. \"We need to revoke Article 50 with immediate effect. The clock for the moment must be stopped\" Major who also faced a revolt inside the Conservative Party over Europe said in a speech in Dublin. \"It\\'s clear we now need the most precious commodity of all: time. Time for serious and profound reflection by both parliament and people. There will be a way through the present morass there always is.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s government fought on Monday to defend its Brexit deal by outlining the legal basis for parliament to support its plan to leave the European Union but instead seemed to fan the flames of rebellion. May faces an uphill struggle to secure parliament\\'s approval in a vote on Dec. 11 when many Brexit supporters and opponents alike say they will reject her vision for leaving the EU Britain\\'s biggest shift in foreign policy in over 40 years. She has toured the country and television studios to try to sell her deal but a move to present her government\\'s legal advice to parliament seemed to backfire on Monday. With several lawmakers doubling down on their criticism of the deal the parliamentary speaker also said he would consider a request by the opposition Labour Party and other parties to consider launching contempt proceedings against May\\'s government for failing to release the full legal advice. It was a threat that one government source shrugged off as just a \"process row\". At a rowdy session of parliament Attorney General Geoffrey Cox outlined the legal advice he had given to the government including over a \"backstop\" arrangement to prevent the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and EU member state Ireland if a future UK-EU trading deal is not reached in time. \"This deal ... is the best way I firmly believe of ensuring that we leave the European Union on March 29\" Cox told parliament. \"This is the deal that will ensure that happening in an orderly way with legal certainty.\" But his words did little to soothe some of the deal\\'s most caustic critics in parliament where many Brexit supporters said the so-called backstop for Northern Ireland risked tying Britain into the EU\\'s customs union indefinitely. \"The legal summary document is worse than we feared: the backstop customs union is indefinite the UK would be a rule taker and the European Court (of Justice) is in charge of our destiny rather than the sovereign UK parliament\" former Brexit minister David Davis said. \"This is not Brexit.\" May\\'s Northern Irish allies the Democratic Unionist Party which prop up her minority government went further. Deputy DUP leader Nigel Dodds said: \"The overall context of this is ... a deeply unattractive unsatisfactory presentation and he (Cox) needs to therefore rather than recommend this agreement recommend that it is rejected.\" SHAKY VOTE Many lawmakers were also angry over being shown what they described as a summary not the full legal advice on May\\'s Brexit deal which her government had seen. The Labour Party and others including the DUP say that the vote is so important for the future of the country that lawmakers should be able to see any detailed legal warnings concerning parts of the withdrawal agreement. \"We have therefore been left with no option but to write to the speaker of the House of Commons to ask him to launch proceedings of contempt\" Labour\\'s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said. Parliament Speaker John Bercow said he would make a \"rapid decision\" on the request. The proceedings against the government for contempt of parliament could potentially result in one or more ministers being suspended or expelled from the House of Commons. Cox said he could not disclose all the advice for fear of it being \"contrary to the interests in the country\" going so far as to shout at Labour MPs that it was no use \"baying and shouting\" when he said he was trying to guard the public interest. \"That is all and it is time they grew up and got real.\" Monday\\'s angry session of parliament did not bode well for the Dec. 11 vote which will come at the end of five days of bruising debate starting on Tuesday. If she loses May could call for a second vote. But defeat would increase the chances of Britain leaving without a deal - a possibility that could mean chaos for Britain\\'s economy and businesses - and put May under fierce pressure to resign. Defeat could also make it more likely that Britain holds a second EU referendum three years after voting narrowly to leave the bloc. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Maltese translators could benefit once the UK leaves the European Union as they along with the Irish are seen as the most proficient in the English language. Malta’s membership in the EU brought with it a new industry: translation of EU documents. Apart from the Maltese working in Brussels and Luxembourg the sector now boasts several freelance companies employing hundreds of translation professionals on contract or freelance basis in Malta. The industry knows its genesis in the year 2000 when Malta negotiated the Maltese language’s status as an EU official language. The University of Malta opened a new post-graduate course for translators and interpreters gradually producing new professionals in the field. The main institutions in Brussels and Luxembourg now employ up to 300 Maltese translators legal revisers proof-readers and assistants. Read: \"We will not renegotiate\" Brexit EU executive tells Britain UK nationals would normally no longer be recruited to fill the English language posts PN MEP candidate Peter Agius the former head of the European Parliament’s office in Malta recently paid a visit to one of the companies offering such services. He said Brexit may have a good effect on this industry. Once the UK is out of the EU UK nationals would normally no longer be recruited to fill the English language posts in the EU institutions. This is expected to open up opportunities for Maltese and Irish nationals – normally best prepared for English translation proficiency better known as technical English. Dr Agius referred to European Parliament debates earlier on in the year confirming that English would remain an EU language after Brexit. “Scores of Maltese working in the EU institutions in policy-related fields started their careers in translation. Those choosing to move to more political jobs opened opportunities for other Maltese-speaking officials who would normally be Maltese nationals. “The Maltese language has opened up opportunities for a deeper integration of Maltese nationals into the EU institutions. “Although all EU officials work with the community interest in mind this undeniably helps to sensitise the institutions to the unique needs of an island member state like Malta” Dr Agius concluded. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Stock markets retreated yesterday with US-China tensions Brexit worries and a lingering US government shutdown taking their toll to a greater or lesser degree across the world\\'s trading platforms. The pound recovered against both the dollar and the euro a day after the UK government narrowly survived a no-confidence vote. Key European markets were around half a per cent lower in mid-afternoon while the Dow Jones index in New York was down around 0.4 per cent shortly after the opening bell. In Europe meanwhile \"political and economic risks weigh on sentiment\" said David Madden analyst at CMC Markets UK. British Prime Minister Theresa May scrambled to put together a new Brexit strategy yesterday with cross-party talks after MPs sparked political turmoil by rejecting her previous agreement with the EU. May reached out to rival parties shortly after surviving a no-confidence vote Wednesday hoping to hammer out a Brexit fix that she could present to parliament next week. Meanwhile after a tumultuous December for markets global equities have enjoyed a broadly strong start to the year largely thanks to optimism China and the US will resolve their trade row. But confidence took a knock Wednesday from a report that said US officials were carrying out a criminal probe into Chinese tech giant Huawei and could soon indict the firm over allegations of theft of trade secrets from its American business partners. Lawmakers have also introduced a bill to ban the export of American parts and components to Chinese telecom companies that are in violation of US export control or sanctions laws – with Huawei and fellow Chinese firm ZTE the likely targets. \"Huawei is effectively an intelligence-gathering arm of the Chinese Communist Party whose founder and CEO was an engineer for the People\\'s Liberation Army\" said Republican Senator Tom Cotton one of the bill\\'s sponsors. The developments follow the arrest last year in Canada of Huawei\\'s chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou who is the daughter of the company\\'s founder and faces extradition to the US on Iran sanctions-linked fraud charges. It also muddies the waters in trade talks between Beijing and Washington which looked to be on a positive course after officials held three days of talks earlier this month with both sides seemingly upbeat. There are meanwhile deepening worries about the impact of the US government shutdown as it moves towards a fifth week with Oxford Economics estimating it is slashing growth by $700 million a week. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Anna Soubry Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston said they planned to sit in parliament alongside eight former Labour MPs who also citing their opposition to Brexit have resigned from the main opposition party since Monday to form the new Independent Group. The trio of Conservatives who support Britain remaining in the European Union said in a joint resignation letter to Prime Minister Theresa May that Brexit had \"re-defined\" their party and was \"undoing all the efforts to modernise it\". \"The final straw for us has been this government\\'s disastrous handling of Brexit\" they added in stinging criticism of May\\'s leadership noting they could \"no longer act as bystanders\" to her EU exit strategy. \"Following the EU referendum of 2016 no genuine effort was made to build a cross-party let alone a national consensus to deliver Brexit.\" The resignations posed a fresh and embarrassing headache for the prime minister as she prepared to travel to Brussels later Wednesday for crucial talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. It also reinforced the view that Britain was plunging further into political turmoil as its MPs struggle to agree a divorce deal just five weeks before it is due to leave the bloc on March 29. The political impasse risks the country crashing out without an agreement with the rising uncertainty blamed for a string of car-makers and other businesses recently announcing job cuts and reduced investment in Britain. May said she was \"saddened\" by the resignations and thanked the MPs for their \"dedicated service to our party over many years\". She noted Britain\\'s membership of the EU has been \"a source of disagreement both in our party and our country for a long time\" but the MPs\\' move would not stop her delivering on the referendum result.\\xa0 \"Under my leadership the Conservative Party will always offer the decent moderate and patriotic politics that the people of this country deserve\" she added. - \\'Radical changes now afoot\\' -Earlier Wednesday an eighth MP quit the Labour Party in protest against its veteran socialist leader Jeremy Corbyn joining its own growing internal rebellion sparked by rows over Brexit and anti-Semitism. Joan Ryan told BBC radio that Corbyn had \"introduced or allowed to happen in our party this scourge of anti-Semitism. It has completely infected the party\". The shake-up of seats mean May\\'s centre-right Conservatives alone are now six votes short of a majority in parliament\\'s lower House of Commons. They can command a working majority of eight thanks to their confidence and supply arrangement for support from Northern Ireland\\'s 10 Democratic Unionist (DUP) lawmakers. Meanwhile The Independent Group now form the joint fourth-biggest bloc in the Commons with 11 MPs -- the same as the centrist Liberal Democrats with predictions of further defections to come. The new group sat squashed together on the opposition backbenches in the Commons during the prime minister\\'s weekly grilling but did not ask May a question. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said: \"There is clearly some very radical changes now afoot as both the Conservatives and Labour have been taken over by militant groups driving out more moderate MPs.\" - \\'Country\\'s interests first\\' -In their resignation statement the three former Conservative MPs who have voted against multiple elements of the government\\'s Brexit legislation blamed their decision on May\\'s \"dismal failure\" to stand up to the \"hard line\" European Research Group (ERG) of Brexiteers in her own party. The group \"operates openly as a party within a party with its own leader whip and policy\" they said. \"We no longer feel we can remain in the party of a government whose policies and priorities are so firmly in the grip of the ERG and DUP\" the lawmakers added. They noted that there was a wider dissatisfaction with the state of British politics with both the Conservatives and Labour moving \"to the fringes leaving millions of people with no representation\". \"We now feel honour bound to put our constituents\\' and country\\'s interests first\" they added.\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Three junior ministers penned a letter in the Daily Mail urging May to delay Brexit if she fails to win concessions from Brussels over the withdrawal terms. The warning comes after three more senior ministers published a similar letter over the weekend. \"We implore the government to take that step this week\" the ministers said in Tuesday\\'s letter. \"All of us were agreed that we couldn\\'t be part of a government that allowed the country to leave the EU without a deal\" one of the three culture and media minister Margot James told BBC radio. \"As D-day approaches I think we felt honour-bound to actually do something to help prevent such catastrophe.\" The letter was also signed by business minister Richard Harrington and energy minister Claire Perry. \"We must act immediately to ensure that we are not swept over the precipice on March 29\" they wrote. \"The way to do that is to seek a short extension to Article 50 to allow the negotiations to be completed the legislation to pass and for the panic that businesses face to subside.\" The Daily Mail said 23 Conservative \"dissidents\" secretly met on Monday to plot strategy. \\'Free debate\\' It said that as many as 15 ministers were \"said to be ready to resign\". May\\'s effective number two David Lidington told BBC radio that the British leader would hold a \"free debate\" with her cabinet members before addressing parliament on Tuesday afternoon. But he refused to confirm multiple British newspaper reports saying May would propose a short Brexit date extension if her EU divorce deal fails to win parliamentary backing by March 12. May has repeatedly pushed back another vote on her EU divorce deal after her first attempt to get it through parliament suffered a record defeat on January 15. \"I am not going to predict what the PM will say later today\" Lidington said. The rebel ministers are all backing a proposed parliamentary amendment that would force May to set a new Brexit date if she fails to get better terms on the disputed issue of the Irish border. \"The colleagues you talk about are good colleagues effective ministers and I think it\\'s important that the Tory party remains a broad church\" Lidington said when asked if the ministers who backed the delay amendment could be dismissed. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: AFP  Top EU officials are seriously considering delaying Brexit until 2021 as Brussels grows increasingly exasperated by the UK\\'s handling of the matter the Guardian reported on Sunday.\\xa0 The plans which would see the March deadline extended by a further two years are reportedly favoured by EU Council president Donald Tusk and EU Commission secretary-general Martin Selmayr. The Guardian quoted unnamed senior EU officials as saying they were unwilling to consider a short-term extension fearing that would just delay ongoing problems by a few months but were more receptive to a two-year moratorium.\\xa0 Reports of the EU\\'s plans came just hours after UK Prime Minister Theresa May sparked outrage by suggesting parliament may not be able to vote on her Brexit deal until March 12 just days before Britain is set to leave the EU. The decision increases the chances that MPs will themselves move to delay Brexit beyond March 29 to avoid a potentially disastrous situation where Britain exits with no agreement at all. May had held out the possibility of a vote this week but said Sunday she was still discussing with the EU possible amendments to the deal\\'s arrangements for the Irish border. \"As we\\'re continuing with those talks we won\\'t bring a meaningful vote to parliament this week\" she told reporters as she arrived at a summit of European and Arab leaders in Egypt. \"But that will happen by March 12. And we still have it within our grasp to leave the European Union with a deal on March 29.\" Since MPs rejected her withdrawal deal last month May has sought to address their concerns about the text\\'s \"backstop\" arrangement which is designed to keep the border with Ireland free flowing. She is meeting with European Council chief Donald Tusk and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the two-day summit in Sharm el-Sheikh and her team will also return to Brussels on Tuesday. But opposition politicians and pro-European MPs in London reacted with fury at what they believe is a deliberate strategy of delay. Labour\\'s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said her move not to hold a vote this week was \"the height of irresponsibility and an admission of failure\". \"Theresa May is recklessly running down the clock in a desperate attempt to force MPs to choose between her deal and no deal\" he said. \"Parliament cannot stand by and allow this to happen.\" \\'Run out of road\\'\\xa0May has refused to rule out leaving the EU with no deal despite the risk of huge economic disruption on both sides of the Channel. She says the only way to avoid this scenario is to support her deal -- but growing numbers of MPs believe that Brexit should instead be delayed. Three of her cabinet ministers on Saturday warned in a newspaper article that if there was no breakthrough this week then the House of Commons would vote for a delay. \"Beyond the next few days there simply will not be time to agree a deal and complete all the necessary legislation before March 29\" they wrote. May has promised to make a statement in the Commons on Tuesday and allow MPs on Wednesday to debate their own ideas for the way forward. Labour MP Yvette Cooper urged lawmakers to support her cross-party proposal to delay Brexit saying: \"How are businesses public services and families supposed to plan in this chaos?\" Sam Gyimah who quit as a junior minister in May\\'s government over her approach to Brexit said her latest decision was \"shocking\". \"We\\'ve run out of road. The meaningful vote can is now being kicked against the wall\" he tweeted. \\'Addition to the treaty\\' After rejecting the EU withdrawal deal that May spent almost two years negotiating MPs demanded she return seek changes to the Irish backstop. This plan would keep Britain in a customs union with the EU after Brexit if and until another way -- for example a free trade deal -- were found to keep open the border with Ireland. The EU has said it will not reopen the text but is looking at what \"guarantees\" could be given to reassure MPs that the backstop would be temporary. Earlier Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the government was still discussing various options. \"It could be a time limit it could be a unilateral exit mechanism\" he told the BBC -- citing two options Brussels has publicly rejected. He added: \"And it could be another legally powerful protocol or addition to the treaty that makes it clear that we would not be bound in the backstop indefinitely against our will.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain and the United agreed Monday to maintain how multi-trillion dollar financial transactions are carried out between the two countries after Brexit aiming to avoid market uncertainty when the UK leaves the EU. \"Market participants can be assured of the continuity of derivatives trading and clearing activities between the UK and US after the UK\\'s withdrawal from the EU\" said a joint statement by authorities in both countries. \"UK and US authorities are taking measures to ensure the UK\\'s withdrawal from the EU in whatever form it takes will not create regulatory uncertainty\" it added. The UK and US carry out trades of derivatives - securities whose value is based on an asset such as currencies stocks and commodities - worth a combined $2.4 trillion daily Bank of England governor Mark Carney told a press conference in London. British finance minister Philip Hammond on Monday said that \"the US and UK are fundamental to the smooth functioning of the world\\'s multi-trillion pound derivatives markets with around 97 per cent of the centrally cleared interest rate derivatives market located in London\".\\xa0 \"The action we have taken today with our partners in the US will ensure that markets can continue to thrive without disruption and is yet another example of the special relationship between our two countries\" he added. Carney meanwhile explained that while \"derivatives can seem far removed from the everyday concerns of households and businesses... they are essential for everyone to save and invest with confidence\". \"As host of the world\\'s largest and most sophisticated derivative markets the US and UK have special responsibilities to keep their markets resilient efficient and open\" Carney said.\\xa0 Derivatives trades pass through clearing houses or intermediaries between the buyer and seller. Chair of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission J. Christopher Giancarlo said London would remain \"a global centre for derivatives trading and clearing\" adding that the deal provides \"a bridge over Brexit through a durable regulatory framework\". With just over a month to go until Britain is due to exit the European Union British Prime Minister Theresa May has said that UK MPs will have a chance to vote again on her massively-disputed Brexit deal by March 12. After MPs rejected her withdrawal deal last month May is seeking ways to address their concerns about its most controversial element the so-called Irish backstop ahead of the UK\\'s planned EU departure on March 29. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

With time running out May pleaded for movement from Brussels to help get a Brexit deal over the line in time for Britain\\'s looming exit from the European Union - scheduled for March 29. British MPs overwhelmingly rejected the deal when it was first put to them in January - with many citing the controversial Irish \"backstop\" clause. A second parliamentary vote will take place on Tuesday. The backstop would keep the whole UK in a customs union with the EU in order to keep the land border between the UK\\'s Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland free-flowing. In an offer aimed at changing the dynamic the EU\\'s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier proposed that the British mainland could leave the bloc\\'s customs union after the divorce though Northern Ireland would stay in. However fearing for the integrity of the United Kingdom May has previously ruled out arrangements that would mean different rules applying in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK. Barnier\\'s new gambit was swifty rejected by Britain\\'s Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay. \"With a very real deadline looming now is not the time to rerun old arguments\" he tweeted. \"The UK has put forward clear new proposals. We now need to agree a balanced solution that can work for both sides.\" The brinkmanship comes with Britain three weeks away from crashing out of the EU after 46 years with very few arrangements in place. Fresh negotiations between British and EU envoys ended in acrimony on Wednesday and May still lacks the assurances she has been seeking to get her deal approved by MPs on Tuesday. \\'Moment of crisis\\' May told an audience of factory workers in the Leave-backing North Sea fishing port of Grimsby that Britain may never split off from the other 27 nations if Brussels fails to help her now. The deal \"needs just one more push to address the final specific concerns of our parliament\" May said. \"Because if MPs reject the deal nothing is certain. It would be at a moment of crisis.\" As it has no unilateral exit clause some lawmakers in May\\'s Conservative Party fear that the backstop plan would keep Britain trapped long-term in a customs union with the EU. May wants a written guarantee from Brussels that this will not be the case. EU officials say the backstop must stay in place until a new trade deal is signed between London and the bloc -- no matter how long that takes. EU ambassadors met in Brussels on Friday to discuss how they might proceed ahead of next week\\'s crucial events in London. Following the meeting Barnier said on Twitter that the EU would give the British mainland \"the option to exit the single customs territory unilaterally\". However \"the other elements of the backstop must be maintained to avoid a hard border\" said Barnier in reference to alignment between Northern Ireland and the EU-member Irish Republic. \"The EU will continue working intensively over the coming days to ensure that the UK leaves the EU with an agreement.\" Demands \\'impossible\\': Dutch PM Meanwhile Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said May was seeking \"impossible\" concessions from the EU. May has scheduled a potential series of parliamentary votes next week that could include one on Thursday asking the EU to grant London an exit day delay. But May said such a deferral would create \"continuing uncertainty\" ruin the business climate and potentially mean that Brexit never happens. \"If we go down that road we might never leave the EU at all\" she said. \"It would let down the more than 17 million people who voted to leave the EU and do profound damage to their faith in our democracy.\" A top member of the Conservative Party\\'s pro-Brexit hardcore also warned that there would be no deal done by the deadline without a substantive backstop change. \"If it is some very minor meaningless tweak then of course we will vote against it\" MP Mark Francois said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: AFP  British MPs this week finally have to decide how and when they want to leave the European Union with just days to go before Britain\\'s scheduled departure on March 29. They will vote again on Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s withdrawal deal and if they reject that will vote to either leave the bloc with no agreement or delay Brexit. Here are the key dates in what could be a momentous week: MONDAY MARCH 11\\xa0 May could go to Brussels to finalise any changes she has secured to the Brexit deal relating to the so-called Irish backstop. The EU has refused to reopen the text but is offering further guarantees about the operation of the backstop an arrangement to keep open Britain\\'s border with Ireland. The deadline is Monday night when May must put down a motion in the House of Commons to allow MPs to vote on the deal on Tuesday. TUESDAY MARCH 12The House of Commons votes again on May\\'s deal just over two months after rejecting it on January 15 by 432 votes to 202. May will open the debate from around 1245 GMT and votes are expected from 1900 GMT. WEDNESDAY MARCH 13\\xa0If the deal is rejected MPs will vote on whether Britain should leave the European Union on March 29 without any deal at all. THURSDAY MARCH 14 If MPs reject a \"no deal\" exit they will vote on whether to seek from the European Union a \"short limited\" delay to Brexit. May has mentioned the possibility of a three-month extension ending before the new European Parliament meets for the first time in early July. THURSDAY MARCH 21/22 EU leaders including May gather for their final summit in Brussels before Britain\\'s scheduled departure. FRIDAY MARCH 29 Britain leaves the European Union unless the process is formally delayed -- or revoked an option nobody is discussing. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 21st 07:34  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The pound rose yesterday as investors weighed the risks of another Brexit-themed week with many willing to bet money on another perhaps long extension to proceedings. In stock trading Frankfurt was under pressure from poor German data but other European equity markets reversed an earlier negative trend while Wall Street stumbled at the opening bell. “The pound is edging higher at the start of what could be a decisive week for the currency with Brexit once more at the front and centre of traders’ minds” said David Cheetham an analyst at XTB. “With the UK government asking for another extension... the most likely outcome seems to be that this will be granted by the other 27 EU members but the chances of a no-deal are creeping higher” he said. Prime Minister Theresa May will press ahead with her bid for a Brexit “compromise” with the Opposition despite a backlash from her own party as she attempts to prevent Britain crashing out of the European Union this week. Talks with the Labour Party are expected ahead of a crucial EU summit tomorrow that could see Britain leave the bloc as early as Friday if no further delay is agreed. Having failed three times to get her own withdrawal deal through Parliament Ms May has been locked in talks with Labour to find a modified plan that could command a majority causing anger within her own party. German data showing falling imports and exports in February spoiled the mood in the eurozone yesterday and added to concerns about the health of the eurozone’s biggest economy which is heavily-trade dependent. German imports fell 1.6 per cent month-on-month to 92.3billion euros while exports dropped 1.3 per cent to 110.9 billion federal statistics authority Destatis said. IG analyst Joshua Mahony called the date “sagging” and said that “with both exports and imports falling for the European powerhouse a worsening picture becomes apparent for the eurozone flagship economy”. Asian indices traded mixed but investors remain broadly upbeat after a strong US jobs report that eased concerns about the world’s top economy. The US created 196000 net new jobs last month beating expectations with moderate wage inflation easing pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. In commodities oil prices extended last week’s gains as an escalation of unrest in crude-rich Libya raised the prospect of a further tightening of supplies. Both main contracts are enjoying a rally thanks to output cuts by Opec and other producers led by Russia as well as sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.

Updated European leaders were poised to delay Brexit on Wednesday but questions remained over just how much longer to give Prime Minister Theresa May to deliver an orderly divorce - and what conditions to attach. French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in combative mood demanding Britain set out a clear path forward and dismissing reports the leaders had already decided to give May space of up to a year. But as May prepared to lay out her plan to her 27 colleagues other officials suggested they would indeed be open to pushing back Brexit for several months if Britain undertakes to hold European elections in late May. Without a postponement Britain is due to end its 46-year membership of the European Union at midnight on Friday with no deal risking economic chaos on both sides of the Channel. May has said she will need until June 30 to ratify the withdrawal agreement. European Council president Donald Tusk the summit host has instead proposed a \"a flexible extension\" and Germany\\'s Chancellor Angela Merkel also said the EU leaders might well back a delay \"longer than the British prime minister has requested\". But as he arrived Macron warned: \"For me nothing is decided nothing and in particular since I hear rumours not a long extension.\" He repeated his insistence that May must provide more guarantees that the delay would serve a useful purpose saying he wanted to hear \"what is the political plan behind it\". May agreed a divorce deal with the EU last November but MPs in London have rejected it three times forcing her to turn to the main opposition Labour party in a bid to find a way through.  As soon as possible But these talks are moving slowly and she is under intense pressure from hardline Brexit supporters in her Conservative party not to compromise. As she arrived May said she wanted to leave the EU \"as soon as possible\". \"I\\'ve asked for an extension to June 30 but what is important is that any extension enables us to leave at the point at which we ratify the withdrawal agreement\" she said. She said she still hoped to leave the EU on May 22 the last day before Britain must hold European Parliament elections. EU leaders have already agreed one delay to Brexit from March 29 to April 12 and Tusk has warned there is \"little reason to believe\" the British parliament can ratify May\\'s deal by June 30. A draft copy of the summit conclusions seen by AFP before the leaders sat down to finalise it said \"an extension should last only as long as necessary and in any event no longer than [XX.XX.XXXX].\" \"If the withdrawal agreement is ratified by both parties before this date the withdrawal will take place on the first day of the following month\" the draft says. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he expected EU leaders to delay Brexit for \"much more time\" than May asked on condition that it holds European elections. Britain has already reluctantly begun preparations for the polls setting the date for May 23 although officials insist they could still cancel it at the last minute. The draft conclusions say that if Britain fails to take part it will leave the bloc on June 1. If an extension is agreed Brussels will portray it as a concession to Britain with some members -- particularly France -- not keen to see the disruptive Brexit drama drag on much longer. EU members want to ensure that a semi-detached Britain does not seek leverage in Brexit talks by intervening in choosing the next head of the European Commission or the next multi-year EU budget. Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said that the issue was not so much the length of the delay as the reasoning behind it saying it had to have a proper justification. “Malta’s decision on what extension should be granted to the United Kingdom with regards to its withdrawal from the European Union will be based on Malta’s best interests and on the interests of the European Union as a whole.”Dr Muscat said the extension agreed should be a sensible one with clear committments. “An extension should not be granted to postpone the issue if no solution can be found.”  May will make her case to her colleagues before leaving them to discuss the length of the Brexit delay - and any conditions - without her. Britain was originally due to leave the EU on March 29. But Brussels agreed an extension after the British parliament rejected the withdrawal agreement negotiated with May. May\\'s ministers have begun cross-party talks with Labour on a compromise to get the withdrawal agreement through the House of Commons. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wants Britain to commit to remaining within the EU customs union an idea that many in Europe would be keen to accommodate. \"We would be generous in negotiating that understanding that the UK couldn\\'t be a silent partner in such an arrangement -- it would have to have a say in decisions being made\" Irish premier Leo Varadkar said as he arrived at the summit.

France\\'s Europe minister on Thursday defended President Emmanuel Macron\\'s opposition to granting a Brexit extension of more than six months saying it would have been seen as an attempt by the EU to keep Britain in the bloc. On Wednesday Macron led a group of EU countries that resisted a move by a majority of EU leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel to give Britain an extension of up to a year.\\xa0 British Prime Minister Theresa May had herself asked for a shorter extension until June 30. In the end the leaders gathered in Brussels settled on October 31 which May accepted. European Affairs Minister Amelie de Montchalin defended Macron\\'s unbending line which caused frustration among fellow EU leaders. \"A very long extension until December 31 or March 2020 as some were proposing... would have been seen by part of the public in Britain but also in other member states as an attempt by the EU to hamper Britain\\'s departure by delaying the decision for as long as possible in hoping that they will change their mind\" Montchalin told parliament. \"EU members or institutions cannot decide in Britain\\'s place to go against their democratic expression (referendum) in 2016\" she said echoing Macron who defended his opposition to a longer extension on the basis that he wanted to \"respect the British vote\". Jean-Louis Bourlanges an MP from the centrist pro-EU MoDem party was critical of the decision to give May more time than she had sought. Calling the July-October period \"essential\" for the new EU parliament that will be elected next month -- and which will include British MEPs if Britain is still a member of the EU on May 22 -- Bourlanges said it was \"unacceptable\" that a country \"that has decided to no longer be part of the club\" be involved in the process. \"I\\'m not blaming president Macron because I see how isolated he was\" Bourlanges said.\\xa0 Macron on Wednesday argued that tolerating a Brexit delay until October 31 was aimed at ensuring \"the proper functioning of the EU\". But an MP from his Republic on the Move (LREM) party Xavier Paluszkiewicz voiced scepticism. Paluszkiewicz said he was worried that hardline Brexiteers would run in the European elections to \"sabotage the work of the European Parliament and act like a veritable Trojan horse.\" \\xa0 Chinese scientists create monkeys with human brain genes Three-person baby born in medical \\'revolution\\' \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Northern Irish allies said Tuesday they would continue to oppose her Brexit deal and raised the prospect of delaying Britain\\'s EU exit by one year to allow more time for negotiations. \"We will not vote for an unamended or unchanged version\" the Democratic Unionist Party\\'s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson wrote in a commentary in the Daily Telegraph newspaper. The deal has already been overwhelmingly rejected twice in the House of Commons. The announcement by the DUP is a blow for May who earlier had seen the prospects of approval of the deal in a possible third attempt improve when Brexit hardliner Jacob Rees-Mogg declared on Twitter: \"The choice seems to be Mrs May\\'s deal or no Brexit\". Rees-Mogg a conservative MP heads the European Research Group of eurosceptic lawmakers. The group had so far voted against the deal. The group is opposed to a long extension to the Brexit deadline because it fears that could lead to no Brexit. But in reaction Wilson wrote: \"There are some colleagues who I admire greatly and who have stood firmly with us in defending Northern Ireland who now take the view that the withdrawal agreement even though it is a rotten deal is better than losing Brexit. To them I say that if the deal goes through we have lost our right to leave the EU. If we sign up to it we give away our right to leave to the whim and dictates of the EU. That is not Brexit.\" \\xa0 \\xa0 Venezuela declares holiday as new nationwide blackout hits Algeria army chief demands Bouteflika be declared unfit to rule \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Theresa May has been given a fresh indication of the difficulties she could face if MPs are given a vote over triggering Article 50 in order to start the Brexit process. Ministers are challenging a High Court ruling that Parliament must be given a say before the formal two-year process can be started by the government but if it comes to a Commons vote a number of MPs have indicated they would oppose the measure unless there are major concessions. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said his party would vote against Article 50 unless there was a guarantee that the final Brexit deal with the European Union is put to a fresh referendum. He insisted he respected the decision made by voters in favour of leaving the EU but said nobody should have a deal \"imposed\" upon them. Although the Lib Dems only have eight MPs they have more than 100 peers in the Lords which could spell trouble for the government if judges rule that a full act of Parliament is required before Article 50 can be triggered as the legislation would have to clear both Houses. Mr Farron said he believed the Lords would not get a vote either for or against Article 50 but would be able to move amendments. We have said we will vote against Article 50 if our red line is not met The Lib Dem leader said: \"We have said we will vote against Article 50 if our red line is not met and it is a single simple red line which is that we want to respect the will of the people and that means that they must have their say in a referendum on the terms of the deal. \"It is the only logical and it is the only democratic option on the table. There will be a referendum at the end of this process so that nobody would have imposed upon them something they didn\\'t vote for.\" He told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"We believe that what started with democracy last June - which we totally respect - must not now end up with a stitch-up with a deal being imposed on the British people that absolutely nobody voted for.\" MPs from other parties - including a Labour frontbencher - have indicated they would be prepared to oppose Article 50. Shadow Foreign Office minister Catherine West wrote on Twitter earlier in November that she would respect the wishes of her constituents who voted to Remain. \"I stand with the people of Hornsey and Wood Green and I will vote against Brexit in Parliament\" she said. Another Labour MP Helen Hayes said she would also be prepared to defy the Labour whip if necessary. She told Today: \"I had somebody in my surgery last week who was in tears because of Brexit and I see genuine distress amongst my constituents about what this path means. \"I would not be representing them if I voted to trigger Article 50 on the basis of no information from the Government about the path that they would then take us on.\" The government will challenge the judges\\' ruling at the Supreme Court in December arguing that prerogative powers could be used to trigger Article 50. An outline of the grounds for appeal published by the Brexit Department said the High Court was mistaken and should have accepted \"the Crown retains the power to give effect to the result of the EU referendum\" by taking the \"first step in the process\" by notifying that it is triggering Article 50. The government\\'s lawyers will argue that \"in any event the continued existence of the power to take that first step is clearly established and authorised by Parliament\". Brexit Minister David Jones said: \"Parliament voted by a margin of six to one to put the decision on whether to remain in or leave the EU in the hands of the British people. \"Now because they didn\\'t like the first answer Liberal Democrat and Labour MPs seek to put the question all over again in hope of a different answer. \"They are attempting to thwart and reverse the decision that was taken on June 23. Only the Conservatives can be trusted to respect the outcome of the referendum and make a success of Brexit.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Central banks are ready to intervene if Britain votes to leave the European Union (EU) at a referendum next week ECB Governing Council member Ignazio Visco was quoted as saying today. The prospect of the closely-contested vote which will help determine Britain\\'s future in trade and world affairs and also shape the EU has rattled markets around the world. \"A British vote in favour of leaving the European Union is the risk that worries us the most at the moment\" Ignazio Visco said in an interview with newspapers including Italian daily La Repubblica. \"We are keeping an eye on this risk day by day and all central banks not just the European Central Bank are ready to intervene with the conventional instruments they have: interest rates repos swaps\" said Visco who is also Bank of Italy governor. Officials told Reuters last week the ECB would pledge to backstop markets in tandem with the Bank of England if Britons vote to leave. Visco said the long negotiation process after an eventual \"Brexit\" vote would certainly have financial consequences but it was difficult to predict how serious they would be. Campaigning for the referendum has been suspended after a British lawmaker was murdered in her electoral district in northern England on Thursday. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain’s exit from the European Union will mean a worrying 15 per cent drop in the bloc’s annual budget from 2020 EU Regional Policy Commissioner Corina Cretu said yesterday. EU leaders are due to discuss the outcome of Britain’s June 23 vote to leave the EU at a meeting in Brussels today. Britain is a net contributor to the EU budget much of which goes to support farmers and poorer regions around the bloc. “Regional policy is the closest to the people. It is the most visible as it shows how European funds change their lives so from this point of view I’m worried because it’s clear that Britain’s exit will make the overall EU budget after 2020 fall by about 15 per cent” Cretu told Digi24 TV from Brussels. Cretu who is Romania’s commissioner also said the EU was engaged in “full talks over fund reallotments for other priorities than regional policy” post-Brexit adding: “We need to return to those values that formed the basis of the EU with responsibility and solidarity from everybody.” “At the end of the year we’ll have a revision of the multi-annual financial framework. I believe there will be voices especially from big contributing states who would want to reallot though I don’t think this is possible for this period.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The Premier League said Britain’s decision to leave the European Union will not harm the prestige of the world’s most popular domestic soccer competition but experts warned of long-term damage to football’s transfer system. The free movement of players around Europe together with huge television revenues raked in by Premier League clubs have made England the destination of choice for many of Europe’s top players. Last season according to Sky Sports 432 players from EU countries were registered to play in the 20-team Premier League. Although they will not be affected immediately Britain’s eventual exit could spell trouble. The Premier League said it would not try to second guess all the implications of Brexit until the dust settled on a seismic day for Britain on which Prime Minister David Cameron announced he would be standing down. “The Premier League is a hugely successful sporting competition that has strong domestic and global appeal” a spokesman said. “This will continue to be the case regardless of the referendum result” he added. Currently players from outside the EU have to meet certain requirements before being granted work permits such as having played 30 per cent of games in the two years prior to moving. The signing of young players could also be affected as FIFA’s rule that players aged under 18 cannot be transferred across borders would be applied to Britain. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May was fighting for survival after a failed election gamble undermined her authority and plunged the country into a major political crisis days before talks to leave the European Union start. May\\'s bet that she could strengthen her hand by crushing what she believed to be a weak opposition Labour Party backfired spectacularly on Thursday as voters stripped her Conservative Party of a parliamentary majority. The stunning outcome leaves May battling to unite different factions of her party and reliant on a handful of Northern Irish parliamentarians just nine days before Britain starts the tortuous process of negotiating its departure from the EU. Britain\\'s typically pro-Conservative press savaged May and questioned whether she could remain in power only two months after officially triggering the country\\'s divorce from the European bloc. Britain\\'s typically pro-Conservative press savaged May and questioned whether she could remain in power Britain\\'s best-selling Sun newspaper said senior members of the party had vowed to get rid of May but would wait at least six months because they were worried that a leadership contest could propel Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn into power. \"She\\'s staying for now\" one Conservative Party source told Reuters. May called the snap election to win a clear mandate for her plan to take Britain out of the EU\\'s single market and customs union so she could slash immigration. But her party is deeply divided over what they want from Brexit and the result means British businesses still have no idea what trading rules they can expect in the coming years. The British pound tumbled against the U.S. dollar and the euro after the election result.  National emergency German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she assumed Britain still wanted to leave the European Union and that talks must start quickly. German politican and EU executive member Guenther Oettinger said however that a weak British leader increased the risk negotiations would turn out badly. Elmar Brok a German conservative and the European Parliament\\'s top Brexit expert told the Ruhr Nachrichten newspaper talks would be complicated by May\\'s formation of a minority government. \"May won\\'t be able to make any compromises because she lacks a broad parliamentary majority\" he said. Less than a year after May was propelled into Downing Street following Britain\\'s surprise referendum decision to leave the EU party insiders were placing bets on how long she could last. \"Theresa May is certainly the strongest leader that we have at the moment\" lawmaker David Jones told the BBC. He said it was impossible to predict whether she would still be prime minister at the end of the year. Owen Paterson a senior Conservative lawmaker said \"let\\'s see how it pans out\" when asked about May\\'s future. \"It is not the outcome any of us would have wanted in the Conservative Party. But we are nine days off from the Brexit talks starting\" he told BBC Radio The Times newspaper\\'s front page declared \"May stares into the abyss\". It said Britain was \"effectively leaderless\" and the \"country all but ungovernable\". \"The Conservatives have not yet broken the British system of democracy but through their hubris and incompetence they have managed to make a mockery of it\" it said in an editorial. \"The task of restoring orderly government in order to make sense of Brexit is now a national emergency and it falls to them.\" The Telegraph newspaper said senior Conservatives including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson interior minister Amber Rudd and Brexit minister David Davis were taking soundings over whether to replace May. Fraught with risk After confirming on Friday that her top five ministers including finance minister Philip Hammond would keep their jobs May was expected to appoint a team that will take on one of the most demanding negotiations in British history. She said Brexit talks would begin on June 19 as scheduled the same day as the formal reopening of parliament. If she is to succeed in delivering the wishes of 52 percent of the public and take Britain out of the EU she must find a way to secure the full support of her party to pass legislation preparing for and enacting the departure. May will also need the support of the socially conservative pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which won 10 seats in Northern Ireland. The two parties are broadly politically aligned but it remains to be seen what price the DUP will demand for its support. Several Conservative lawmakers including Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson have also raised concerns about the DUP\\'s opposition to same-sex marriage. Davidson one of the few Conservatives to emerge as a winner from the election after she increased the party\\'s presence in Scotland said she had demanded and received \"categoric assurance\" from May that the policy would not change. One DUP lawmaker suggested support for May could come vote by vote making the job of governing fraught with risk. \"As I reflect on the results I will reflect on what we need to do in the future to take the party forward\" May said on Friday in a televised statement. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s spokesman dismissed that as \"speculation\" although many EU officials assume the reports were based in part on leaks from her own government. Phil Hogan Ireland\\'s member of the Commission said Britain had \"brought forward proposals that go very close towards meeting the requirements of the EU-27 member states\". Britain wants to start negotiations on the trade terms that will be put in place once it leaves the EU in 2019 but Brussels has demanded it first resolve three issues: settling its bill guaranteeing the rights of expatriates and explaining how the EU-UK land border will operate on the island of Ireland. Work was continuing on all three issues Barnier said and he hoped to be able to tell EU leaders at a summit in two weeks that \"sufficient progress\" had been made that they could launch negotiations on a future trade pact. May has been given an \"absolute deadline\" of Monday when she will meet Barnier and Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels to deliver offers in all three areas so that EU leaders can give approval at the Dec. 14-15 summit. Several EU diplomats told Reuters Britain had given a verbal commitment in recent days to pay a share of EU budget spending on pensions and undisbursed commitments after it leaves. \"Deal or settlement are not the words I would use\" said one envoy warning that a collapse in talks was still possible. \"The UK is moving\" said another. \"We finally in the 11th hour seem to have some traction and positive exchanges in the financial talks. But we\\'re still going through the financial issues line by line to explore potential movement and space.\" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson a leading Brexit campaigner who earlier this year said Brussels could \"go whistle\" for such a big sum told Reuters in Ivory Coast that he hoped Britain\\'s offer would \"get the ship off the rocks\" and launch trade talks. Irish trouble But some EU governments are concerned that London may push back harder on the other two issues. Brussels wants the EU court to have sway over the rights in Britain of EU residents and wants to hear London\\'s plans to avoid a hard customs border with EU member Ireland that could disrupt peace in Northern Ireland. Guy Verhofstadt point man for the European Parliament on a Brexit treaty which the legislature must ratify wrote to Barnier to complain that negotiations on guaranteeing citizens\\' rights had stalled and that some progress had even reversed. A third EU diplomat said issues involving \"sovereignty\" over citizens\\' rights and the border now seemed harder to crack than a month ago. He said: \"Where we now seem to be moving ahead on money other issues are proving more difficult than previously.\" There was concern he added that Britain was \"trying to sideline Irish concerns by moving on the money\" saying a split on this could still scupper any deal on trade talks next month. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told parliament in Dublin: \"Progress is being made but not that is sufficient ... Things are changing on a daily basis and are rapidly evolving.\" British and EU sources played down reports that negotiators had discussed hard numbers on the settlement. Both sides have always said that a final figure will depend on future variables and that their initial interest was agreeing a \"methodology\". Sources in the British government which wants any offer on its part to unlock a simultaneous pledge from Brussels of opening trade talks in the new year said it had not offered up any numbers to the EU only commitments that will be covered. Criticism among hardline Brexit supporters of such payments has been somewhat more muted in recent weeks and British media reported that May had won backing from her cabinet to pay more. Nigel Farage whose UK Independence Party had a big role in forcing last year\\'s Brexit referendum said paying the bill was a \"complete sell-out\" and urged May to walk away. \"It\\'s an eyewatering sum if it\\'s 55 billion\" said Andrew Bridgen a lawmaker from May\\'s Conservative party who unlike the prime minister campaigned for Brexit in the referendum. \"But as we know nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. \"It depends on what we get for it in terms of a trade deal.\" EU officials say Brussels is willing to work with May to massage the figures -- which in the end depend on future developments -- in order to help her win support at home. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  UK Prime Minister Theresa May hailed \"a new sense of optimism\" in Brexit talks telling parliament on Monday an agreement to move negotiations on to future trade ties is progress and will reassure those concerned Britain may leave with no deal. May weakened after losing her Conservatives\\' majority at a June election rescued an agreement last week to move the talks to unravel more than 40 years of union on to a second phase after easing the concerns of her Northern Irish allies over the future role of the border with EU member Ireland. But the discussion of Britain\\'s trade relationship with the EU after Brexit contains many pitfalls and could widen differences among her top team of ministers or cabinet over how Britain should look after it leaves the bloc. In a statement to parliament May took to task those who doubted that she could move the talks beyond the initial stage of agreeing terms on how much Britain should pay citizens\\' rights and the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. READ: Britain only fights a handful of cases every year at the maligned ECJ \"This is good news for people who voted leave who were worried we were so bogged down in the tortuous negotiations it was never going to happen\" she told parliament. \"It is good news for people who voted remain who were worried were going to crash out without a deal.\" May will head to Brussels on Thursday for a summit meeting at which she expects the leaders of the other 27 EU states to approve an assessment by negotiators that the sides have made \"sufficient progress\" to move on to phase two. Anti-Brexit protesters gathered outside the UK\\'s Houses of Parliament on Monday. Photo: Reuters/Peter Nicholls But she warned that the government will only pay a financial settlement if Britain and the EU secure a future trade deal. The deal to launch further talks looked in jeopardy a week ago when May was forced to abandon a choreographed meeting in Brussels intended to seal the deal after her allies in Northern Ireland expressed fears she was proposing a special status for the region - out of sync with the rest of the United Kingdom. READ: Half of Britons would back a second Brexit\\xa0referendum study finds After days of diplomacy there was a compromise - if no overall Brexit deal is secured Britain will keep \"full alignment\" with those rules of the EU\\'s single market that help cooperation between Ireland\\'s north and south. But those words have reverberated in both London and Belfast with Brexit minister David Davis saying they were more \"a statement of intent\" than a legally binding move. On Monday Davis told LBC radio his words had been taken out of context and denied he was backing away from the commitment which the EU described as \"a deal between gentlemen\". \"And it is the clear understanding that it is fully backed and endorsed by the UK government\" the European Commission\\'s chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters in Brussels. Davis\\' comments may have been aimed at members of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party which props up May\\'s Conservative minority government in parliament after the party expressed concerns about how alignment could work without Britain staying in the EU\\'s single market and customs union. Or he may have wanted to ease the fears of some campaigners for Britain to leave the EU who say the possibility of having to follow the bloc\\'s rules would mean that they would have Brexit in name only. But May said the commitments made in the first round of talks -- which includes a payment of 35-39 billion pounds over many years to meet EU obligations -- were necessary to sever ties with the bloc. \"In doing so we can move on to building the bold new economic and security relationships that can underpin the new deep and special partnership we all want to see\" she said. \"A partnership between the European Union and a sovereign United Kingdom that has taken control of its borders money and laws once again.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British households are their least confident since immediately after last year’s Brexit vote partly because of this month’s interest rate hike and further signs of a slowdown in the housing market a survey showed yesterday. A consumer confidence index produced by polling firm YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research a consultancy sank to 106.6 in November down sharply from 109.3 in October. It was the first fall since June although it remained above the 100 level above which consumers are considered to be feeling confident. All eight of the index’s underlying measures weakened and a score for household finances over the past 30 days sank to its lowest level since January 2014. Christian Jaccarini an economist at Cebr linked the fall to factors including the first interest rate hike by the Bank of England in over a decade and a slowdown in the housing market. “With these economic headwinds set to persist and the OBR forecasting weaker growth households are understandably worried” Jaccarini said referring to a sharp cut to Britain’s economic growth outlook by the Office for Budget Responsibility the government’s fiscal watchdog on Wednesday. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond announced measures to help the housing market in his budget statement also on Wednesday. The survey was conducted between November 1 and 21 and was based on responses from 5673 people. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  The European Union\\'s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said today he was concerned at the slow progress of Brexit talks while his British counterpart David Davis called for \"imagination and flexibility\" to move on. British officials arrived in Brussels hoping to push the EU towards talks about their post-Brexit ties which the bloc refuses to launch until there is agreement on London\\'s exit bill and other pressing \"divorce\" matters including the rights of EU citizens in Britain after March 2019. \"To be honest I am concerned. Time passes quickly\" Barnier told reporters as he welcomed Davis back for a new round of talks. The third formal session since the process began in June it is due to wind up on Thursday. READ: The Brexit brain drain has already started \"We must start negotiating seriously\" Barnier said. \"The sooner we remove the ambiguity the sooner we will be in a position to discuss the future relationship.\" He welcomed a series of proposals London made over the summer break but made clear they fell short of what EU leaders want to see before they will agree to open negotiations on the future free trade agreement the British government wants. Impatient with the structure of talks agreed among the 27 other states and now binding Barnier\\'s negotiators the British position papers made frequent reference to a future relationship with the EU rather than just the immediate task of bringing legal clarity for people and business when Britain leaves. \"The UK government has published a large number of papers covering important issues related to our withdrawal and our vision for a deep and special partnership\" Davis said. \"We want to lock in the points where we agree unpick the areas where we disagree and make further progress on the whole range of issues\" he added. READ: Have some imagination Britains tells EU negotiators\\xa0 To do that would require \"flexibility and imagination from both sides\" he said. But the EU wants to settle the major separation issues of ensuring expatriate rights agreeing a divorce bill and squaring the circle of the future Irish border before jumping into talks about post-Brexit ties with London. \"The EU 27 and the European Parliament are united. They will not accept that separation issues are not addressed properly\" Barnier said. \"I am ready to intensify negotiations over the coming weeks in order to advance.\" British officials took a relaxed view of Barnier\\'s implied criticisms noting it was a familiar line from the former French minister and dismissed a suggestion talks were going badly. No breakthrough expected The EU has already signalled that the slow progress so far has made talks about a new accord with Britain less likely to start after an EU summit in October as had been hoped. The EU and Britain seem far apart on agreeing how much London should pay the bloc on departure to account for previous commitments. The Irish issue is extremely delicate because of the history of political violence there as well as the complex economic consequences of Brexit. Dublin said today much of the future border arrangements between Northern Ireland and Ireland could be solved before Brexit talks enter the next phase. Neither side expects major breakthroughs this week in talks aimed at unravelling more than 40 years of union. Neither seems ready for major political concessions at this stage. An EU official said it was \"clearly worrying that we have major differences of core issues ... with very little time to land all this even if Britain moves\". Britain\\'s opposition Labour Party on Sunday offered an alternative to the policy pursued by Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May by saying it would stay in the European single market for a transitional period after Brexit. The British and German chambers of commerce together urged negotiators on Monday to start talks about future trading relations and particularly customs arrangements swiftly. Writing in Le Monde in his native France Barnier said the EU and Britain must remain allies for their common defence: \"The Union of 27 and the United Kingdom will have to join forces to stand up to common threats\" he said. \"The security of our citizens cannot be haggled over.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A number of insurers that write insurance in Britain operate from Gibraltar and from Malta. But if Britain loses access to the single market after Brexit Malta-based insurers will no longer be able to sell insurance into Britain. Gibraltar in contrast is a British overseas territory so those ties will continue. \"An application to re-domicile St Julians has been submitted to the Malta Financial Services Authority in order to protect the business and enable the insurer to continue trading with the UK\" Markerstudy said in a statement. \"The favoured proposal is to move the operation to Gibraltar.\" Markerstudy already has two insurance firms in Gibraltar focusing on UK business Markerstudy Insurance and Zenith Insurance.

European business federation BusinessEurope this week called\\xa0 on Britain to maintain as many EU regulations as possible after Brexit to limit disruption to trade and supply chains. Negotiators are meeting ahead of a June 28-29 EU summit to seek progress on outlining what kind of relationship should replace Britain’s EU membership after it leaves next March and after a status-quo transition period ends in 2020. “Regulatory alignment between the EU and the UK is of utmost importance to preserving value chains and avoiding non-tariff barriers to trade. Regulatory cooperation is paramount” the group which includes Britain’s CBI said in launching a new report. Also calling for rapid agreement between the two sides to avoid uncertainty and the risk of a “cliff edge” whereby Britain simply reverts to global trade rules BusinessEurope called for simplified customs procedures. It said small businesses with little experience of trade outside the EU Single Market would require special help from the authorities to cope with changes. “No free trade agreement to date has come close to solving the issues of regulatory divergence and this will be a challenge for both sides to address” the group said while adding that business wanted EU negotiators to avoid letting a deal with Britain unpick the rules of the Single Market. Negotiators aim to have a broad outline ready by late this year alongside a detailed treaty on how the initial departure will work. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The British parliament\\'s rejection of the Brexit agreement makes crashing out of the EU without a deal much more likely the bloc said Tuesday as it warned there is no more it can do. Lawmakers inflicted another crushing defeat on beleaguered Prime Minister Theresa May voting to reject the divorce deal even after she secured further guarantees from Brussels. Senior EU officials lined up to voice regret at the result and to hammer home the message that Brussels would not make any further concessions to help May win over recalcitrant MPs. If parliament fails to approve an accord the UK will crash out of the bloc without a deal on March 29 - unless a delay is agreed something the EU said it would be willing to consider. A spokesman for Donald Tusk the president of the European Council said he regretted the result but warned that from Brussels\\' viewpoint \"it is difficult to see what more we can do\". \"With only 17 days left to 29 March today\\'s vote has significantly increased the likelihood of a \\'no-deal\\' Brexit\" the spokesman said. The EU\\'s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier echoed the view saying there was nothing more Brussels could do. \"The EU has done everything it can to help get the Withdrawal Agreement over the line. The impasse can only be solved in the UK. Our \\'no-deal\\' preparations are now more important than ever before\" Barnier tweeted. \\'Uncharted waters\\' The message was repeated by a spokeswoman for European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. \"Given the additional assurances provided by the EU in December January and yesterday there is no more we can do. If there is a solution to the current impasse it has to be found in London\" the spokeswoman said. EU ambassadors will meet in Brussels on Wednesday morning to assess the vote the bloc\\'s contingency plans - and to discuss whether to grant a delay to Brexit if London asks for one.\\xa0An extension would need the backing of all 27 remaining EU countries \"We are in uncharted waters\" one EU diplomat told AFP. \"We are not talking about a situation where there are still good solutions - we have to choose between different suboptimal solutions.\" Shortly before the vote Barnier voiced disquiet at the tenor of the debate in the House of Commons warning MPs against the \"dangerous illusion\" that they could benefit from a transition period even without a proper divorce deal. \"Listening to debate in @HouseofCommons: there seems to be a dangerous illusion that the UK can benefit from a transition in the absence of the WA\" Barnier tweeted referring to the Withdrawal Agreement. \"Let me be clear: the only legal basis for a transition is the WA. No withdrawal agreement means no transition.\" \\'Buckle up\\' Transitional arrangements to wind down Britain\\'s involvement with the EU form part of the agreement - but would need the British and European parliaments\\' approvals to take effect. Some Brexit-supporting MPs argue that contingency measures announced by the EU that would come into effect in the event of no deal would effectively operate as a mini transition deal - a notion strongly rejected by Brussels officials. Attention will now turn to whether Britain will ask for a delay to Brexit - a question MPs would be asked to vote on in the coming days.\\xa0 \"Should there be a UK reasoned request for an extension the EU27 will stand ready to consider it and decide by unanimity\" Juncker\\'s spokeswoman said. An extension would need the backing of all 27 remaining EU countries.

The European Union\\'s chief negotiator Michel Barnier warned Tuesday it is \"day after day more likely\" that Britain will crash out of the bloc without an orderly withdrawal agreement next week. Barnier was addressing a think tank in Brussels the day after British lawmakers again failed to unite behind any alternative to the Brexit withdrawal agreement Prime Minister Theresa May signed last year. \"No deal was never our desired nor intended scenario. No deal was never my intended scenario but the EU 27 is now prepared. It becomes day after day more likely\" Barnier told the audience. \"Let\\'s not forget first that we have already an agreement we have already a deal and it was concluded by Theresa May and the British government and the European Council and European Parliament on November 25 last year four months ago\" he said. \"We tried to make sure that the UK could leave the EU on March 29 just as the UK had foreseen itself... If the UK still wants to leave the EU in an orderly manner this agreement this treaty is and will be the only one.\" Mick Jagger to undergo heart surgery: report Sea Watch rescue ship prevented from sailing by new Dutch government requirements \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s parliament on Wednesday holds a series of votes to seek an alternative Brexit solution as pressure mounts on Prime Minister Theresa May to resign if she wants her own unpopular plan approved. Three years after Britons voted to break the country\\'s near half-century bond with the European Union this week was supposed to see the endgame - but no clear end is in sight. Parliament has already twice rejected the deal forged by the EU and May - who personally favoured staying in the bloc before becoming head of a government tasked with steering Britain out of it. But House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said on Wednesday \"there\\'s a real possibility\" that May will try again to get her deal passed on Thursday or Friday. The price of failure could be high. May is still desperately short of votes and a third successive defeat would weaken her further. EU leaders have given Britain a new extended deadline of April 12 to get May\\'s deal ratified or find a new way out. Failure to do either could result in a no-deal divorce that could disrupt trade on both sides of the Channel and send the British pound plunging. Alternatively Britain could seek an even longer extension putting it in the bizarre situation of having to take part in European Parliament elections nearly two months after it was supposed to have left. 16 proposals The UK parliament decided to break the deadlock by giving itself the right to choose from a variety of alternatives to May\\'s plan. It will vote at 1900GMT on options that range from holding a second referendum to recalling the EU withdrawal notice and maintaining ties with the bloc. May\\'s own deal is not one of the 16 proposals submitted for debate to parliament speaker John Bercow. He will announce the ones that will be on the agenda at around 1530GMT. Time has been set aside on Monday for MPs to try and whittle down the most popular options to a final plan. \"It is very unlikely that today\\'s votes will reveal a majority for anything\" said Oliver Letwin a Conservative MP who is spearheading the initiative. \\'Better than not leaving\\' May will hope that none of the alternatives get majority support and that her own agreement ends up looking like the best option. Her government is banking on rebels who oppose the EU getting frightened by the prospect of Brexit being either overturned or watered down. She has already won the backing of Jacob Rees-Mogg - the ultra-conservative who heads the European Research Group (ERG) wing of her party that twice voted against the deal. \"I think we\\'ve got to the point where legally leaving is better than not leaving at all\" he told BBC radio on Wednesday. \"Half a loaf is better than no bread.\" But the Northern Irish coalition partners on whom May relies for support in parliament made clear that they would rather see Brexit extended by a year than vote for her plan. Other holdouts are making their votes contingent on May\\'s promise to step down after Brexit so another leader would negotiate the next stage of the process. \"If the prime minister announces a timetable of departure I think that\\'s going to swing a lot of people behind her deal we could get it over the line\" said Conservative MP Nigel Evans. May is due to meet with an influential group of Conservative party members in parliament at 1700 GMT. Rethink Brexit? European leaders are watching the entire process with concern. European Council President Donald Tusk urged EU lawmakers on Wednesday to remain open to a long postponement while Britain rethinks its stance. \"I said that we should be open to a long extension if the UK wishes to rethink its Brexit strategy which would of course mean the UK\\'s participation in the European Parliament elections\" Tusk said. He also pointed to the nearly six million signatures on an online petition in the past week asking the government to cancel Brexit. \"They may not feel sufficiently represented by UK Parliament but they must feel represented by you\" he told European Parliament members in a tweet. Tusk urges EU not to \\'betray\\' pro-Europe British voters Brunei to impose death by stoning for gay sex and adultery  \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May faces deadlock Thursday over a new Brexit plan after narrowly surviving a no-confidence vote sparked by the crushing defeat of her EU withdrawal deal. With the clock ticking May has appealed to opposition leaders to meet for cross-party talks before she presents an alternative proposal to parliament on Monday. But her opponents have set out a list of demands for cooperating - including ruling out the possibility that Britain would leave the EU in March without any deal at all. The embattled leader conceded the divorce terms she struck with the EU had been roundly rejected after MPs delivered the heaviest government defeat in parliament in modern British political history on Tuesday - 432 votes to 202. \"Now MPs have made clear what they don\\'t want we must all work constructively together to set out what parliament does want\" May said in a televised address to the nation on Wednesday evening after winning a no-confidence vote triggered by the opposition Labour party. She set out a schedule of cross-party talks that began immediately with meetings with the Scottish nationalist Welsh nationalist and the pro-EU Liberal Democrat leaders. \"We must find solutions that are negotiable and command sufficient support in this House\" she had told parliament earlier. But opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would only meet May if she could \"remove clearly once and for all the prospect of the catastrophe of a no-deal Brexit\". May said she was \"disappointed\" by Corbyn\\'s decision and stressed that \"our door remains open\". On Wednesday evening her spokesman said the possibility of a \"no deal\" was still on the table. Ian Blackford of the Scottish National Party (SNP) said his party would only participate if she were prepared to consider delaying Brexit ruling out a \"no deal\" and the option of holding a second referendum. May has flatly rejected a second vote. Late-night talks The prime minister is working to the tightest-possible deadline as Britain prepares to leave the bloc that for half a century defined its economic and political relations with the rest of the world. Her defeat sparked warnings from European leaders that the prospect of \"no deal\" had increased with the potential for huge economic disruption on both sides of the Channel. May must return to parliament on Monday with a Plan B that she and her team intend to negotiate with various MPs through the weekend. Her offer to meet with the opposition \"rings hollow without evidence of her readiness to compromise on the substance of Brexit\" the Guardian newspaper said pushing for a \"menu of options\" to be presented to parliament. Meanwhile the Daily Telegraph warned that parliament \"may be planning a betrayal\". \"After two-and-a-half years Plan B is to let parliament take over\" the Telegraph said. \"At least it is a plan; but is parliament capable of delivering on the referendum result or is this the start of a great betrayal of that vote?\" Divorce delay? May survived the no-confidence vote Wednesday thanks to the support of members of her Conservative Party and its Northern Irish allies in the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). But more than a third of the Conservatives and all 10 DUP members of parliament voted against her Brexit arrangements on Tuesday -- each for their own reason. May will therefore tread carefully as she tries to win over opposition lawmakers -- many of whom want to remain in the EU -- while also attempting to appease more hardened Brexit-backing coalition partners. She stuck to two key principles on Wednesday: limiting EU migration and pursuing an independent trade policy. Both points rule out Labour hopes of membership of an EU customs union or its single market. Yet she also hinted at the possibility of delaying Brexit. May said the EU would allow this \"if it was clear that there was a plan that was moving toward an agreed deal\". EU officials have said extending the negotiating period could be possible until the newly elected European Parliament meets in July. On Thursday the pound edged up against the dollar with dealers optimistic that Britain will not leave the EU without a deal in place despite May\\'s exit plan being thrown out by MPs. Blurred lines European leaders have repeatedly said they will not reopen the draft withdrawal agreement sealed at a special Brussels summit in December. French President Emmanuel Macron suggested the EU might be willing to tweak a few minor points -- but only if they did not alter the bloc\\'s existing position on trade and borders. \"We won\\'t just to solve Britain\\'s domestic political issues stop defending European interests\" he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was time for talks as long as London could present a clear and united position. And Irish Prime Leo Varadkar added \"that if the United Kingdom were to evolve from its red lines on the customs union and on the single market that the European Union could evolve also\". \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

And the threat is not just on paper. CPI director general Andrew Large told BBC that the industry relies on last-minute imports and that without a trade deal delays at the borders would roll over to production with stocks quickly wiped out. Guiseppe Munarie country operations manager for Sofidel (which makes toilet roll for a number of brands) explained to the BBC that although suppliers were building up stocks where possible it was possible that the supply chain would get caught short. He said that there were enough supplies for “several weeks” but neither he nor Mr Large were able to rule out what might happen in extremis assuming that extra stocks were not flushed out.

Seven MPs leaving the Labour party was always going to dominate the news cycle but given that the UK currently stands to exit the EU without a deal political journalists should be wary about getting sucked into ongoing speculation about further resignations and instead focus on the rapidly approaching cliff edge. Inside the “Westminster bubble” rumours of newly formed parties conflicts between MPs and private meetings with rival politicians no doubt excite most journalists who closely follow the hustle and bustle of day-to-day parliamentary life. But as the UK edges closer to leaving the EU without a deal these are atypical times and the media have an important role to play in the weeks to come. They help set the public and political agenda influencing how people view and understand politics which in turn puts pressure on politicians to respond to events and issues. This is not to suggest the processes and personalities of politics are unimportant. They clearly are and the media are right to prominently report the MPs leaving Labour and to discuss the implications of their decisions. But it is the extent to which these seven politicians continue to influence Brexit coverage that should be closely monitored. If a succession of MPs start to jump ship and join this new group of independent politicians then it should warrant prominent media attention. It could potentially change parliamentary arithmetic with a future vote on a Brexit deal or radically alter the political landscape if a snap election is called. But at the moment it doesn’t look like a mass exodus of MPs is imminent. Instead we may witness in the days and weeks to come a few MPs calling press conferences and making dramatic announcements about leaving their parties. Or we may hear thinly veiled threats from the usual political suspects about abandoning their parties if they do not see changes to their leaders’ Brexit positioning. But while political posturing and internal party strife may appeal to the news values of journalists on the ground it risks overlooking the far bigger story about how the parties and leaders are responding to the challenge of reaching a Brexit deal or governing without one after March 29 2019. That the media are often more preoccupied with personalities than policy is not necessarily a new or surprising observation at a key democratic moment. In my co-authored book Reporting Elections: Rethinking the Logic of Campaign Coverage we systematically reviewed more than 100 academic studies around the world in order to explore what stories typically make up the news agenda before people cast their vote. Overall we found that in many countries more than 40% of the TV news agenda – sometimes much more – was devoted to the processes of the campaign rather than coverage of the issues or the policy preferences of rival political parties. Longitudinal studies from the 20th century and into the 21st century suggest this trend may be increasing. The implications of focusing on the processes of politics rather than the policy choices of competing parties can be ideologically profound. It can shift public attention away from politicians resolving real-life issues and events and promote a more partisan or polarised culture of politics. From Corbynistas against Blairites to the May loyalists versus Hard Brexiteers the narrow Westminster lens can lead to broadcasters becoming fixated on party political conflict that pits big personalities against each other but does little to enlighten public understanding of complex issues. The evidence has long shown most people do not closely follow the political news cycle. Moreover studies have shown that many do not accurately recall political events and issues – and this is all too often a result of being confused by the language of Westminster politicians and journalists. So for example when it is reported that the “Malthouse compromise” could be the answer to the UK’s political impasse it would be hard to imagine most people being able to articulate what this represents let alone understand how it can unlock negotiations between the UK and EU. As the clock continues to tick down on the UK exiting the EU the media remain critical to the process. UK public service broadcasters in particular are legally obliged to report accurately and impartially with a mission to raise public knowledge and understanding of politics and public affairs. Broadcasters can choose not to be distracted by party political shenanigans and address the salient issues that concern most voters. They can independently explain to audiences the evidence about the impact of a no-deal Brexit the possible options the UK has in reaching a settlement with the EU or whether a second referendum is a realistic prospect. Needless to say none of this is necessarily easy or straightforward to explain. But unlike politicians caught up in internal party conflict or ideological dogma journalists have the power to bring more light than heat on fast changing events and issues.

Three years on from its vote on EU membership and the UK still has little idea what its future relationship with the EU might turn out to be. Under pressure from europhile members of her cabinet Theresa May has finally decided that running the Brexit clock down is in nobody’s interest. Instead she has now taken the perhaps equally disappointing decision to kick the Brexit can further down the road if politically necessary. Just how far down the road is itself not clear. If May’s withdrawal agreement does not pass on March 12 she has promised a vote on March 13 on whether MPs support a no-deal Brexit.\\xa0British politicians seem to be consumed with their own infighting rather than dealing with the real issue of negotiating a future working relationship with the EU And if that fails there will be another vote on March 14 on requesting an extension to the Article 50 negotiation process – thereby delaying Brexit. It remains unclear how long this would be for although EU sources have suggested 21 months as a plausible length for defining the future relationship between the EU and UK. In the meantime both consumers and businesses are paying the Brexit price. This is because in the presence of ongoing economic policy uncertainty the sterling exchange rate takes a hit as foreign investors become less willing to trust and therefore invest in the UK economy. To see this the following graph plots movements in economic policy uncertainty (which is calculated from newspaper reports regarding policy uncertainty from 11 UK newspapers) and the sterling exchange rate. The graph shows how uncertainty sky rocketed in the aftermath of the EU referendum of June 2016. As policymakers adjusted to the reality of the referendum result policy uncertainty declined and more so following from March 2017 when Mrs May triggered Article 50 in an attempt to enter “meaningful” negotiations with the EU. Nevertheless the never-ending negotiations have definitely taken their toll as evidenced from the visible spike in policy uncertainty in 2018 and early 2019. Rising policy uncertainty causes the pound to depreciate versus the US dollar. This in turn translates into inflation and adds pressure on the Bank of England to either raise interest rates (to combat inflation) or become less unwilling to stimulate the economy by cutting interest rates if a damaging no-deal Brexit becomes reality. Large swings in the exchange rate combined with higher policy uncertainty means that UK exporters face constant uncertainty over their earnings and future investments. This makes them less willing to invest. Not only does this deprive the economy of new jobs it also undermines the UK’s productivity prospects adding to the country’s well-known “productivity puzzle” (very weak productivity growth in the aftermath of the 2008-09 financial crisis which leaves little room for strong wage increases). In other words the ongoing policy uncertainty affects both ends of the economy: consumers who face lower incomes and export producers who prefer not to make productive investments because looming risk poses a threat to their profits. To counteract the adverse impact of increasing policy uncertainty on business investments and productivity one option the UK government has is to aggressively cut the corporate tax rate. This currently stands at 19% for the UK (and will be cut further to 17% in 2020). This is already much lower than the OECD average of 23.8%. Since the UK’s corporate tax rate is already a lot lower than its competitors without having much positive impact I am afraid that May’s government is running out of options to counteract the adverse impact of uncertainty. That is apart from dealing with the uncertainty itself. But British politicians seem to be consumed with their own infighting rather than dealing with the real issue of negotiating a future working relationship with the EU. There is little to suggest that if the Article 50 process is extended the uncertainty fog surrounding Westminster will lift. So merely extending Article 50 will do little to reassure businesses and consumers that there is light at the end of the Brexit tunnel. French statesman Charles de Gaulle famously said: “To govern is always to choose among disadvantages.” Delaying every decision instead fuels uncertainty and damages both your credibility and the economy.

Updated 5.15pm British Prime Minister Theresa May asked the European Union on Friday to delay Britain\\'s departure until June 30 while Brussels suggested that it might be best to postpone the split for up to a year. The competing visions of how to unwind Britain\\'s 46-year involvement in the European project will be hashed out again at an EU summit in Brussels on Wednesday and EU leaders have already reacted sceptically to May\\'s request. The current Brexit deadline of April 12 has already been pushed back once from March 29 because of the UK parliament\\'s repeated failure to back the deal May signed with the other 27 EU leaders in December. May\\'s formal request to EU Council president Donald Tusk said Britain thinks the delay \"should end on June 30 2019\" - the same date she asked for and was refused at the last EU summit last month. \"If the parties are able to ratify (the withdrawal agreement) this date the government proposes that the period should be terminated earlier\" May wrote in a letter released by Downing Street. A senior EU official said that Tusk\\'s own idea for a \"flexible\" 12-month extension \"will be presented to member states today\". But a source in French President Emmanuel Macron\\'s office said it was \"premature\" to consider the request without \"a clear plan\" from May about what she intended to do with the extra time. German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass said May still had \"many questions\" to clarify. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte - seen as one of May\\'s closer European allies - also said the letter \"doesn\\'t answer\" important concerns. \\'Political cover\\' May said Britain would start preparing for European Parliament elections in case it is still a member of the bloc when they begin on May 23. The idea is deeply unpopular with Britons who voted to quit the EU and chart their own future in a 2016 referendum whose arguments are still being waged to this day. Political analysts in London said May probably knew that her new deadline will be rejected because EU leaders do not think she can get her deal through parliament any time soon. May is under intense pressure from the right wing of her Conservative Party to pull Britain out of the bloc as soon as possible - with or without a deal. \"I think that Theresa May is looking for political cover because she is asking for an extension she knows she can\\'t get\" said King\\'s College European politics professor Anand Menon She wants Brussels to \"force her to do something else so that at least she won\\'t get accused of selling out.\" The first response from leading Conservative eurosceptics to the idea was very critical. \"If a long extension leaves us stuck in the EU we should be as difficult as possible\" Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg tweeted. \\'Fight to save Brexit\\' The other 27 EU nations must give unanimous backing to any deadline extension. Some EU leaders fear that Britain\\'s participation in the European Parliament vote will help boost the standing of anti-EU parties due to their popularity among Brexit-backing Britons. UK far-right leader Nigel Farage called on his supporters Friday to vote for his Brexit Party in the European election. \"The fightback to save Brexit has begun\" Farage tweeted. Unlikely breakthrough May\\'s team is currently negotiating with leaders from the main opposition Labour Party in a bid to find a compromise that can pass parliament in the coming days. Downing Street on Friday called the talks \"constructive and an ongoing process\". May\\'s letter said the talks\\' failure would likely see the two parties jointly produce several options that would be put up for a series of parliamentary votes. Labour is pushing May to accept a much closer post-Brexit alliance with the bloc that includes its participation in a customs union. May had previously dismissed the idea because it bars Britain from striking its own trade deals with global giants such as China and the United States. But analysts said it was not in Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\\'s political interests to help get May\\'s agreement over the line. \"If they come to an agreement that\\'s quite dangerous for him\" University of Nottingham political history professor Seven Fielding said. \"I would be surprised if he doesn\\'t walk away.\" Pro-Haftar forces pushed back near Libya capital: security source US revokes ICC prosecutor\\'s visa over Afghan probe \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

In delaying Brexit again British Prime Minister Theresa May has put off her own promised departure date - but the move risks reviving efforts by her furious colleagues to unseat her. May said last month she would step down once her EU divorce agreement was passed by the British parliament an offer she hoped would persuade her Conservative critics to back the plan. It failed and faced with the prospect of a \"no deal\" exit on Friday she has now agreed to delay Brexit potentially until October 31. Downing Street says she stands by her commitment to see through this stage of Britain\\'s exit and some colleagues say she is going nowhere. \"I don\\'t think we should be rushing to change our leader when there is a big task to be done\" Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC ahead of the summit. May herself told a Brussels press conference that she \"sincerely regrets\" the delay but \"we must now press on at pace with our efforts to reach a consensus on a deal\". But many of May\\'s Conservative MPs are livid that Britain is now likely to take part in European Parliament elections next month - something she previously said would be unacceptable. Brexit-supporting MP Peter Bone earlier noted May said she would not accept staying in the EU beyond June 30. \"If the prime minister intends to keep her word can we expect her resignation later tonight?\" he tweeted. May\\'s move to reach a compromise with the opposition Labour Party to find votes to replace those she has lost on her own side has also provoked accusations of \"surrender\". And Brexit anger aside a growing number of Conservatives - including ministers - are already making moves for the anticipated vacancy in the top job. Party challenge May has faced constant challenges since taking office following the historic 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU presiding over a divided party and since 2017 without a majority in parliament. More than 30 ministers have quit since the 2017 election with some - notably Boris Johnson - becoming the strongest critics of her European strategy. Her failure to get her EU divorce deal through parliament in recent months has left her authority in tatters unable to control legislation or even her own ministers. In a vote on the eve of the EU summit 97 Conservative MPs opposed May\\'s original plan to delay Brexit until June 30 and around 80 more abstained. EU leaders rejected this date after a lengthy discussion in Brussels but the new date of October 31 is shorter than some proposed. This potentially scuppers any MPs hoping to use an extension to replace May with someone who would play tougher with the EU. And there is no obvious way for May\\'s Conservative critics to replace her. She survived a confidence vote within her Conservative party in December making her immune for a year. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also tried to oust the government in January but May\\'s MPs rallied around unwilling to risk another election. None of those skills She has hinted she might voluntarily step down if she fails to get a Brexit deal through by June 30. But the pressure to quit might come earlier if the Conservatives do badly at local elections on May 2. Aides emphasise her determination to deliver Brexit but many believe it is May\\'s rigidity that is blocking any compromise deal with MPs. Professor Meg Russell of University College London\\'s Constitution Unit noted that leading a minority government requires a \"flexible nimble approach including the ability to compromise and to work cross-party\". \"Theresa May clearly has none of these skills\" she wrote. However her premiership has been marked by her dogged refusal to give up and few commentators would rule out the prospect that she tries to stay on for as long as possible.

Photo: Stefan Rousseau/Reuters  Britain is to adopt an interventionist approach to balancing its heavily services-based economy for the post-Brexit era aiming to reinvigorate industrial production and stimulate investment in technology and R&D. Unveiling her long-awaited ‘Modern Industrial Strategy’ yesterday Prime Minister Theresa May demanded closer collaboration within key industries in exchange for government support on regulation trade and research. The focus on industry and the shift to a governmental hands-on approach challenges the traditional Conservative laissez-faire ideology championed by former prime minister Margaret Thatcher. May asked businesses to work together to tackle industry-specific challenges citing examples of successful collaboration that have helped attract overseas investment from the likes of carmaker Nissan and enabled aerospace firms such as BAE Systems to develop a competitive edge. In return she pledged to reciprocate with ‘Sector Deals’ that address regulatory barriers look at how trade and investment deals could be used to increase exports and support the creation of new institutions to provide leadership drive innovation or boost skills. “The modern industrial strategy will back Britain for the long term: creating the conditions where successful businesses can emerge and grow and backing them to invest in the long-term future of our country” May said in an e-mailed statement prior to the announcement. Impending exit from the EU threatens to undermine the financial services sector The outline of the strategy was set out in a ‘Green Paper’ consultation document seeking input from industry. “Today’s Green Paper signals a more ambitious approach to securing growth and preparing for the inevitable pressures that will accompany Brexit” said Paul Everitt CEO of the aerospace trade body ADS. The government also listed 10 strategic pillars behind its strategy such as skills development and improved procurement. Since coming to office weeks after Britain’s vote to leave the EU last year May has pushed the once-unfashionable concept of industrial strategy to the top of her agenda creating a new government department to lead the project and chairing a top-level cabinet committee on the subject. It comes as Britain’s impending exit from the EU threatens to undermine the financial services sector with several banks planning to shift thousands of jobs abroad because they fear they will lose access to the EU market. May said last week that Britain would be withdrawing from the single market and seeking a free trade agreement with the EU instead – a path critics have described as ‘Hard Brexit’. “The idea that the government can have any reasonable strategy for British industry while recklessly withdrawing from the single market is laughable” said Don Foster business spokesman for the rival and pro-EU Liberal Democrat party. “It’s like the manager tying their team’s bootlaces together while telling them they have a plan to win the match.” Under the banner of building an economy that distributes wealth more evenly following decades of industrial decay in parts of Britain the plan seeks to protect the economy from the risk of leaving the EU and address a mood of disenfranchisement that drove many voters to back Brexit. The government said early work had been done on sector deals for a number of industries: life sciences ultra-low emission vehicles nuclear and creative industries. But it said it would work with any sector that could “organise behind strong leadership to address shared challenges and opportunities.” \\nmore Careers »  \\n Mar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Mixed sentiment has surrounded global markets this week as an approaching Brexit vote in June seems to have taken the biggest slice of market concerns. Investors have in fact highlighted the negative implications a Yes vote would have on the UK economy with the financial sector and universities primarily set to take the brunt. With earnings season in the US approaching an end over 75 per cent of companies in the S&P 500 have beaten earnings estimates following analyst downward revisions in estimates. With oil prices having stabilised in recent weeks and the FED keeping rate hikes on hold US high yield debt has enjoyed ongoing rallies on the back of significant undervaluation in the asset class during the peaks of the oil crisis and recession fears. Affairs in Europe are looking better of late despite France still struggling to regain momentum. German and Italian PMI’s (Purchasing Managers’ Index) last week beat expectations supporting the increase in consumer confidence issued by recent surveys in the Eurozone. The Brexit vote is no doubt keeping consumer confidence subdued at least until a clearer outcome path is known. Recent talks on Greek debt relief have also had a positive impact on the yield on Greek sovereigns whereby the 10 year yield as at yesterday tightened by a good 55 basis points. As a rule of thumb tighter yield spreads are positive for bond prices. One would have expected disappointing manufacturing data out of China last week to have a negative domino effect on US and European equities. The pair however stood firm to date and performed well this week thanks to stable oil prices. The fears of a Brexit as soon as June has subdued the potential of consumer confidence to regain momentum. A yes vote as stressed by investors could see the Sterling depreciate by estimates of over 20 per cent. Not only would the currency take a hit the UK’s financial sector has over 250000 jobs reliant and exposed to ongoing relationships with the European union. Nonetheless UK Gilts have recovered to tighten by 24 basis points over the past 2 weeks despite the release last week of negative services PMI in the UK indicating the sovereign is possibly recovering from being oversold in recent weeks on market fears of a yes vote. Patience will be key to the risk-on investor over the coming weeks. Should the UK remain a part of the EU oversold UK assets could see significant upside potential with the sterling at the foreground of any potential gains. Meanwhile fading interest rate hike expectations in the US complimented by an improving energy sector allows for further upside in US high yield. Energy high yield issues account for over 13.5 per cent of the Merrill Lynch US High Yield Index which year to date has returned over six per cent. The risk-on investor may well get ready to source an attractive entry point as the energy sector improves. Any considerations however should wait until a Brexit vote outcome is known. Regardless of the correlation between US high yield and the UK if any a yes will vote will surely trigger a renewed wave of volatility that could affect all risky asset classes.

Photo: Reuters  Whoever has studied economics has encountered the ‘Minsky moment theory’ named after economist Dr. Hyman Minsky who had noted that in times of stability traders tend to inflate asset prices by leveraging their positions with the consequence that markets shift towards a bearish mode while a dash for the exit puts pressure on asset prices which shift towards a plunge. After the bubble bursts the debt burden due to leverage remains and can depress activity for a long time. Undoubtedly last Thursday’s Brexit vote was one of the most important events over the past years and some sort of correlation with the theory is surely unquestionable. After the bubble bursts the debt burden due to leverage remains and can depress activity for a long time. Last Thursday’s Brexit vote was one of the most important events over the past years and some sort of correlation with the theory is unquestionable.Despite polls throughout the campaign having indicated a neck to neck race the percentage of undecided voters was still significant and it seemed that markets were betting that those undecided voters would ultimately be conditioned by uncertainty and shift towards consensus voting to remain. Odds at leading betting agencies were certain the remain campaign would win with odds at the remain front at 1.13 against 8 for a leave vote 88 per cent chance and 12 per cent respectively.Interestingly - and to some market participants surprisingly enough - the build-up until Thursday evening was strong implying that market participants were building-up their positions possibly also through leverage. In fact during the week markets in Europe spiked by just over 4.5 per cent (Dax) while the Sterling rallied by 2.4 per cent in confront of the Dollar. Ironically enough the Sterling continued to gain ground late on Thursday evening when Nick Farage the (UKIP party leader and one of the most prominent Brexit campaigners) stated that the ‘remain’ would win by a thin margin. A turnaround commenced throughout the night and the ‘Minsky moment theory’ kicked-off with a major sell-off which led to a rapid and impulsive collapse in market-clearing asset prices a sharp drop in market liquidity and a move to cash. The Sterling crashed to 11 per cent the FTSE 100 8 per cent while in Europe the Euro Stoxx 50 plunged by 10 per cent as investors dashed to safety. In my view the recent sell-off has created opportunistic trading positions and this was witnessed over the past days in which markets gained considerable momentum. That said uncertainty on how the transition of exit will take place is still at elevated levels and thus investors should act with caution when dipping into the current attractive valuations. Despite contingency plans are surely in place this was also highlighted by the Bank of England their trigger and their implications are still unclear and thus volatility is imperative.Last Friday’s sell-off relevance to the ‘Minsky moment’ is surely a mild momentum when compared to the crisis way back in 2008. That said as the exit terms are yet to be determined let us not assume that this will be a plain sailing exit. So sit back and relax the ride could get interesting.This article was issued by Jordan Portelli Investment Manager at Calamatta Cuschieri.

Photo: Darrin Zammit Lupi  Malta's tourism industry is not expected to feel the Brexit pinch for at least a few months as the majority of Britons planning to visit the island had booked their trip prior to their country's EU referendum.\\xa0This view was expressed by a number of operators and Tourism Minister Edward Zammit Lewis at a conference about the impact of Brexit on Malta's tourism industry. The conference was organised by the Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association. \\xa0 News of Britain's referendum decision to leave the EU led to a dramatic fall in the value of the sterling against the euro within hours of the referendum result being announced. The fall \\xa0meant a more expensive trip for British tourists traveling to the eurozone. However both Air Malta's deputy Chief Commercial Officer Joe Galea as well as the minister argued that Britons were not renowned as being last-minute travelers and that an expected drop in arrivals would likely be delayed. On the other hand university lecturer Alfred Quintano cautioned that Malta in recent years had already become a more expensive destination and that a Brexit might make the situation even worse. Alpine Group Chief Investment officer Nicholas Zahra\\xa0said this could be more of a shock than a crisis. He said that Malta's recent tourism successes had been driven by the political situation in North Africa Middle East and Turkey. Malta's biggest threat could come when the situation in these countries improved he said. MHRA deputy president George Micallef said Malta could be hit by the open skies directives which had brought cheaper flight prices.The Malta Business Bureau's John Vassallo said that Brexit had brought about uncertainty in the regulatory framework of the UK and this might lead to an exodus of multinational firms from which Malta could benefit.On his part Tourism Minister Edward Zammit Lewis said that the devaluation of the Sterling would not give a competitive advantage to other destinations which were in the same boat and also facing the same challenge. \\xa0Malta was in touch with British operators to mitigate longer-term exchange rate effects through a focused marketing campaign he said. Dr Zammit Lewis said that Malta could also seek to maintain certain rights which British tourists enjoyed as EU citizens through bilateral agreements.MHRA president Tony Zahra delivered the concluding address. He noted that Malta's dependence on the UK sector had gone down from 70 per cent of total arrivals about 30 years ago to 30 per cent at present. However he warned that Malta could not afford to lose its national airline as otherwise it would have lost a major tool at its disposal to take remedial action in difficult times. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Stock markets around the world rebounded for the second day yesterday as fears about last week’s Brexit vote eased and investors wagered central banks would ultimately ride to the rescue with more stimulus. Oil prices rallied and Wall Street was sharply higher turning positive for the year. Britain’s FTSE 100 recovered all its post-Brexit losses to close at the highest level since April. UK and European banks a focus of concern since Britain shocked global markets by voting to leave the European Union extended a recovery from two days of trading that had knocked almost 40 per cent off shares in Barclays and RBS . An index of major European banks was up for the second straight day but the gains could not come close to offsetting losses in the first two trading sessions after the referendum. Still stock markets in Frankfurt Paris and London all gained more than two per cent . “While the initial panic from Brexit appears to have eased a huge amount of uncertainty remains which could continue to weigh on sentiment for a while” said Craig Erlam from online brokerage Oanda. The S&P financial stocks index  which was hit the most since the referendum was up 1.13 per cent. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 216.17 points or 1.24 per cent to 17625.89 the S&P 500 gained 27.9 points or 1.37 per cent to 2063.99 and the Nasdaq Composite added 73.82 points or 1.57 per cent to 4765.68. Sterling the other big victim on Friday and Monday was last up 1.4 per cent at $1.3522 against the dollar to recover a full 4 cents after Monday’s 31-year low. Markets face a prolonged period in limbo while a new UK prime minister is selected and officials come to grips with the possible scenarios for Britain’s departure. At the heart of the recovery are expectations that major central banks will go easier on monetary policy in anticipation of another hit to global growth from Europe. The US 30-year Treasury yield approached record lows in a scramble for long-dated bonds on bets of more unconventional stimulus measures from major central banks. “There are very reasonable expectations from central banks globally especially from the US Federal Reserve the ECB and the BOE to provide more liquidity guidance and clarity to support markets” said Stephen Woods chief market strategist for Russell Investments in New York. The first Federal Reserve policymaker to comment since the vote Governor Jerome Powell said Brexit had shifted global risks “to the downside” reinforcing expectations the Fed will not hike US rates this year and could even cut. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

PHOTO: REUTERS  European Union governments agreed a common Brexit negotiating plan yesterday and renewed their insistence that they would not open talks on a post-Brexit trade deal until London agrees to settle what it owes the Union. Ministers from the 27 other EU states met in Brussels to sign off on a common strategy and mandate the EU executive in the form of chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier to launch talks on their behalf after Britain’s June 8 election. The strategy and mandate were adopted unanimously officials said. Barnier said he expected to sit down with British officials for the first time in the week starting Monday June 19 and to report to EU leaders on the talks during a summit on June 22-23 exactly a year since Britons shocked the Union by voting to leave in a referendum on June 23 2016. Several ministers stressed their priorities are to provide legal clarity for EU citizens in Britain before they find themselves living outside the EU in March 2019 and to agree how to calculate what London owes Brussels before departure. EU leaders agreed last month on a phased structure of talks under which the free trade agreement which British Prime Minister Theresa May wants with the EU would only be discussed after a first phase of talks makes “significant progress” on issues such as citizens’ rights and the budget. “It’s clear that in this matter on the finance issue if we get stuck then we will not get onto ‘phase two’ what should come afterwards between the European Union and Great Britain” Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said on arrival. His Dutch counterpart Bert Koenders told reporters: “It’s very British to know that if you’re part of a club and then you leave you have to settle your accounts.” Barnier’s British counterpart Brexit Secretary David Davis told a weekend newspaper that his threat to walk out without a deal with the EU was serious. Barnier said that was “not my option” and he did not want to think about such an outcome which EU officials say would create a chaotic legal limbo. Deal or no deal the EU treaty stipulates that Britain will be outside the bloc on March 30 2019. May and her Conservative government have said they will meet their obligations but challenge the idea that Britain might have to pay tens of billions of euros to the EU to cover its share of existing financial commitments. Britain wants to launch talks on a future trading relationship as soon as possible. Barnier said there was no plan to “penalise” Britain and that the two-stage approach whereby trade talks could start early next year was needed to avoid confusion. Settling the first phase of talks would “build trust” between the sides. Several ministers stressed the unity among the 27. Some including Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz said the other net contributor countries must pay no more into the EU budget after Britain left. Germany’s European Affairs Minister Michael Roth underlined the need to get started to contain the damage from what he said was a “lose-lose situation” for both Britain and the EU. “We have two years. The clock is ticking” Roth told reporters. “We have to get down to work.” (Reuters) \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain and the European Union on Monday reached a landmark deal on a transition phase that will last for nearly two years after the historic Brexit divorce next year EU negotiator Michel Barnier said. The two sides also agreed on a \"backstop\" solution for the thorny issue of the future of the Irish border just weeks after Prime Minister Theresa May said no British premier could ever accept such an idea. After an \"intensive\" weekend of talks in Brussels Barnier said the two sides were \"in agreement on a large part\" of the divorce treaty governing the terms of Britain\\'s departure after four decades of membership. \"We have reached an agreement on the transition period\" Barnier told a press conference with Davis. The transition will begin on Brexit day -- March 29 2019 -- and last until December 31 2020 and during that period Britain \"will no longer participate in the European Union decision-making process\" Barnier said. \"Nevertheless it will preserve the benefits the advantages of the single market and the customs union... and will therefore be required to respect all the European rules just like all member states do.\" Davis told the news conference that the transition deal \"gives the certainty demanded by businesses and citizens across Britain and the European Union.\" Both sides wanted the transition deal in place so that it could be signed off by EU leaders at a Brussels summit later this week allowing the unlocking of talks on the future British-EU relationship in April. The purpose of the transition period is twofold: to give businesses and citizens time to adjust to life after Brexit and to give Britain and the EU more time to agree on a trade deal. Britain also agreed in principle to the EU\\'s \"backstop\" plan for the status of the Irish border under which British-ruled Northern Ireland would remain part of the EU\\'s customs union if there is no better idea. The thorny issue will however require further talks to be fully resolved the two sides said. The EU insists that any divorce deal must ensure there is no \"hard border\" between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland saying it could compromise the 1998 peace accord that ended decades of sectarian violence in the British province. Several weeks ago May said \"no UK prime minister could ever agree\" to the plan saying it would compromise Britain\\'s constitutional integrity and effectively draw up a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. The idea was also deemed \"unacceptable\" by the pro-British party in Northern Ireland that props up her government. \"We agreed today that the backstop solution must form part of the legal text of the withdrawal agreement\" Barnier said. The remaining 27 EU countries say Britain must agree to terms on Northern Ireland before it will sign off on the final version of their divorce agreement and advance to trade talks in April. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney who met Barnier in Brussels said on Twitter on Monday that \"Brexit negotiations are moving forward.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The European Union\\'s existing system of market access for foreign financial firms is not perfect but can work for Britain after it leaves the bloc next year the EU\\'s financial services chief said on Tuesday. The so-called equivalence system is based on Brussels granting access to the EU for banks insurers and asset managers from outside the bloc if the bloc deems their home rules to be similar enough. But Britain has said equivalence is too one-sided and wants a bespoke trading deal for banks based on mutual recognition or the UK and EU accepting each other\\'s rules. Valdis Dombrovskis European Commission Vice President and responsible for financial services said that equivalence was a pragmatic solution for Britain after Brexit. \"Equivalence is not perfect neither for firms nor for supervisors\" Dombrovskis told the CityWeek conference at the Guildhall in London in the heart of the City. \"But we should not let perfect be the enemy of good. Equivalence has proven to be a pragmatic solution that works in many different circumstances and it can work for the UK after Brexit as well.\" EU leaders agreed in March that \"improved\" equivalence could form part of future trade negotiations with Britain for financial services. Britain and bankers have seized on this as a sign that a more bespoke type of trade deal is now more likely. But Dombrovskis said that equivalence is applied to a country that is systemic for the EU - Britain is the biggest financial centre in Europe - then there should be more \"granularity\" when deciding if rules are similar. Catherine McGuinness political leader of the City of London the historic \"Square Mile\" financial district said after Dombrovskis\\' speech that a mutual recognition deal would be best for Britain and the EU. \"Clearly we have work to do\" she added. START REPAPERING Britain and the EU have agreed in principle on a \"standstill\" transition deal from Brexit Day in March 2019 to the end of 2020 but it won\\'t be ratified until October or later. British regulators have said banks should be allowed to use the transition period to take more time to implement Brexit plans. But Dombrovskis said that until ratification financial firms in Britain who need to continue serving EU customers after next March should continue with plans for new hubs in the bloc in case there is no transition deal from next March. \"As Vice President in charge of financial stability my message is that all parties – firms and supervisors - need to continue their work to prepare for all scenarios\" Dombrovskis said. \"Our current discussions confirm that companies can alleviate the main risks by repapering contracts and adapting operational models\" he added. Repapering refers to moving accounts of customers from Britain to existing or new hubs in the EU27. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Britain’s economy unexpectedly picked up speed in the last three months of 2017 according to data which showed that the prospect of Brexit was still weighing on the economy but not as heavily as once feared by investors. Gross domestic product grew at its fastest pace of 2017 rising by 0.5 per cent from the third quarter and beating the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists that growth would remain at 0.4 per cent. But the Office for National Statistics said the big picture was one of a slower and more uneven expansion in the world’s sixth-biggest economy as it approaches its departure from the EU in March next year. In 2017 as a whole growth was 1.8 per cent compared with 1.9 per cent in 2016 the slowest since 2012. For comparison the International Monetary Fund expects growth of 2.4 per cent in the eurozone last year. Investors took the data as a sign that the Bank of England might move more quickly towards only its second interest rate hike in more than a decade. Sterling added to its recent strong rise against the US dollar and climbed against the euro. The Bank of England said last month it expected the economy might have slowed slightly in late 2017. The BoE’s rate-setters are due to announce their next decision on borrowing costs on February 8. Britain has been helped by the recovery in the world economy last year They raised rates for the first time since 2007 in November. Most economists have said they expect the next rate hike in late 2018 but some think it could come as soon as May. Britain’s economy grew more weakly than other big rich nations for much of last year as the impact of the 2016 Brexit vote pushed up inflation and many businesses turned cautious ahead of Brexit. However Britain has been helped by the recovery in the world economy last year which is expected to carry on in 2018. Finance Minister Philip Hammond described the figures as excellent underscoring the resilience of the economy. BoE Governor Mark Carney said on Friday Britain could start to grow more quickly later this year if there is clarity about its future relationship with the EU. While recruitment agencies letting agents and office management firms helped boost growth companies which relied on spending by consumers had a much slower fourth quarter. Manufacturers who have prospered from demand spurred by the recovery in the global economy also grew strongly. Separate data published on Friday showed personal insolvencies hit a three-year high reflecting the financial strain on many households. Given the strength of global growth Britain’s would have grown by about 2.5 per cent in 2017 were it not for the Brexit vote Kallum Pickering an economist with Berenberg said. Compared with the same period in 2016 growth between October and December slowed to 1.5 per cent its weakest pace since the first quarter of 2013 and down from growth of 1.7 per cent in the third quarter. The Reuters poll had pointed to growth of 1.4 per cent. Last Friday’s data showed Britain’s dominant services sector grew by 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter gaining pace after growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter the ONS said. Industrial output slowed to show growth of 0.6 per cent from 1.3 per cent in the third quarter after the Forties oil pipeline Britain’s biggest was closed for more than two weeks in December after the discovery of a crack. Britain’s construction sector shrank by one per cent its worst quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2012. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Almost 190 peers are listed to speak over the two days of second reading where the principle of the Bill will be considered. Debate on the Bill on Tuesday is expected to end after the 94th speaker Conservative Baroness Morris of Bolton before resuming on Wednesday. The upper chamber\\'s red benches were packed as debate started. Lords Leader Baroness Evans of Bowes Park said it was an honour to open the debate on such an important Bill. Some suggest that this House will ignore the referendum or attempt to use the Bill to frustrate the Brexit process. I don\\'t share those concerns. \"This Bill ensures we have a functioning statute book on the day we leave\" she told peers. \"It is about providing certainty and continuity for people and businesses. It is about ensuring people\\'s rights are upheld and legal protections are maintained. It is vital to a smooth and orderly exit from the EU. My Lords this Bill is not about revisiting the arguments of the referendum. \"Not for the first time there has been much speculation about what might be expected from Your Lordships\\' House as we consider this Bill. Some suggest that this House will ignore the referendum or attempt to use the Bill to frustrate the Brexit process. \"I don\\'t share those concerns. I am keenly aware of the collective sense of responsibility felt across this House to our important constitutional role and I am confident noble Lords will take a constructive approach to our deliberations.\" Labour former transport secretary Lord Adonis proposed a rare motion of regret that the Bill did not provide for a second referendum on the terms of the final Brexit deal. The final say should rest with the people once they see the terms proposed by the government Pointing out there were more peers due to speak than in any other debate in the chamber\\'s 800-year history he said: \"It is symbolic and it is because of the magnitude of the issue at stake that I move this motion. \"Just the first say on Brexit was given to the people so the final say should rest with the people once they see the terms proposed by the government.\" Lord Adonis added: \"The Prime Minister promises a deep and special partnership with the European Union when actually we are leaving the union and undermining our deep and special partnership. \"We are told that frictionless trade will arise amazingly from the setting up of thousands of trade barriers where they currently don\\'t exist. \"And on the future of Ireland where Parliament ought to tread with especial care given the tragedies of recent decades the Government says it intends continued regulatory alignment when its stated policy elsewhere is to discontinue alignment and promote regulatory dealignment. \"The House needs to reconcile rhetoric and reality in all these areas.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Ever since Britain voted to leave the EU nineteen months ago some of the world\\'s most powerful finance companies in London have been searching for a way to preserve the existing cross-border flow of trading after it leaves the bloc in 2019. Officials from the European Union\\'s executive told British financiers in meetings in recent weeks that they won\\'t agree to a deal that would allow finance companies to operate in each others\\' markets without barriers because Britain has said it will leave the single market according to two people who attended the meetings. The plan proposed that Britain and the EU would allow cross border trade in financial services on the condition that each side preserve regulatory standards in line with the best international standards. This model would be maintained by close co-operation between regulators and financial policymakers. The proposals are the most detailed so far on how a long-term agreement on financial services with the EU may work after Brexit with papers setting out how a pact could be structured and policed and it has been endorsed by Britain\\'s Brexit minister David Davis. But EU officials are dismissive of any trade models that would see Britain retain similar levels of market access while leaving the single market regime. \"They have made it very clear to us that this is unacceptable to them\" said one senior British finance executive present at one of the meetings. \"This was our best and frankly only proposal. We don\\'t have a plan B.\" Britain\\'s vast financial services looks set to be one of the most divisive areas in the Brexit negotiations with Britain demanding a generous deal while the EU refuses to shift from its insistence that Britain\\'s red lines -- such as ending the free movement of workers from the EU -- make that impossible. Britain is currently home to the world\\'s largest number of banks and hosts the largest commercial insurance market. About six trillion euros ($7.47 trillion) or 37 percent of Europe\\'s financial assets are managed in the UK capital almost twice the amount of its nearest rival Paris. And London dominates Europe\\'s 5.2 trillion euro investment banking industry. But unless it can secure a trade deal for all its geographic proximity Europe\\'s largest financial capital will end up adrift with the same access to the EU as other countries like Singapore. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

European Union leaders will express concern on Friday over a lack of progress in talks with London on how to avoid reimposing controls at the border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after Brexit. Leaders of the 27 countries that will remain in the EU after Britain leaves next year will take stock of negotiations on a withdrawal agreement and on a political declaration on what future relations with London should look like. A draft document outlining conclusions of their European Council meeting in Brussels singles out the lack of an operational arrangement for the Irish border called by EU leaders a backstop solution. The backstop solution has been agreed in very general terms in December but there has been no consensus since on how to put it in place in practice by Brexit day in March 2019. \"The European Council expresses its concern that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for Ireland/Northern Ireland\" the draft conclusions seen by Reuters said. Britain and the EU want to keep a free flow of people and goods over the border without returning to checkpoints symbols of the three decades of violence in Northern Ireland that was largely ended by a 1998 peace deal. But finding a practical solution for customs checks needed for what will become an external border of the EU after Brexit has so far proven elusive. EU leaders will insist on Friday on \"the need for intensified efforts\" to find a solution without which the whole withdrawal agreement or a deal on a transition period until the end of 2020 cannot take shape. Time is running out because unless a final agreement on the withdrawal treaty the transition period and a political declaration on future relations are agreed at an EU summit in October there won\\'t be enough time for parliaments to ratify the treaty in Britain and the remaining EU countries before March 2019. \"Work must also be accelerated with a view to preparing a political declaration on the framework for the future relationship\" the draft conclusions of the Friday meeting said. \"This requires further clarity from the UK as regards its position on the future relationship.\" EU officials have complained that Britain is not telling them what it wants from a future relationship makings talks very difficult. British Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to overcome differences on Brexit within her Conservative Party and has clashed with parliament over what powers it should have over the final deal. Wary that a withdrawal treaty might not be agreed in time time the EU leaders said governments should brace for the worst. \"The European Council renews its call upon Member States and all stakeholders to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes\" the draft said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Lloyds Banking Group plans to operate three subsidiaries in continental Europe after Britain leaves the EU according to a source familiar with the matter in a sign of how Brexit is fragmenting a banking industry long concentrated in London. Lloyds Britain\\'s biggest mortgage lender was widely expected to manage its continental business from one new subsidiary in Berlin. But executives now plan two further hubs to service customers across the European Union the source told Reuters. One is likely to be in Frankfurt and the location of the second is yet to be confirmed the person said. The plans by Lloyds - an institution more than 250 years old that has always concentrated its operations in Britain - shows how Brexit is forcing banks to upend history and business models to guarantee they can continue selling their products in Europe. They are part of a wider trend that is seeing lenders distribute their post-Brexit resources among a number of cities on the continent rather than basing the bulk of operations in one place as they have for decades in London. Swiss bank UBS said in March it would pursue a \"decentralised\" model in line with moves by Goldman Sachs Bank of America and JPMorgan. Such plans will incur greater costs and complexity as each subsidiary needs to be capitalised and licensed by regulators. They run counter to the expectations among many executives and analysts following Britain\\'s 2016 vote to leave the EU that banks would each choose one main continental hub to replace London with Frankfurt Paris and Dublin the frontrunners. A spokesman for Lloyds declined to comment. Earlier this year separate sources told Reuters that Lloyds would house its main European subsidiary in Berlin after converting an existing Bank of Scotland branch that Lloyds inherited following the HBOS takeover a decade ago. SINGLE MARKET The plan to run three continental units has partly been prompted by new British regulations that have already forced UK banks to carve up balance sheets into individually capitalised \"ringfenced\" and \"non-ringfenced\" entities ahead of a January 2019 deadline. The rules are aimed at insulating bank depositors from riskier trading activities and protecting taxpayers from having to backstop troubled banks once deemed \"too big to fail\". To comply with the rules following Brexit Lloyds needs a second subsidiary to support its non-ringfenced euro bond trading business the source said. That subsidiary is likely to be set up in Frankfurt the source said which is home to Europe\\'s biggest euro bond trading market outside London and offers the bank the best chance of running a smooth service to clients following Britain\\'s expected exit from the EU single market on March 29 next year. The Frankfurt subsidiary will not need a full banking licence but Lloyds has applied to Germany\\'s financial markets regulator for the requisite investment firm licence the source added. Lloyds is also seeking to establish a third subsidiary in an as yet unconfirmed location to support its Scottish Widows \"closed-book\" insurance business which include premium-paying policies from customers based across the European Union. All three subsidiaries will need to be capitalised individually the source said but the total pool of capital needed is not expected to be large compared with the size of the group\\'s overall balance sheet. Earlier this year Reuters reported the ultimate size of the pool of capital carved out to capitalise the Berlin subsidiary was expected to run to the \"low hundreds of millions of pounds\" representing less than 1 per cent of the bank\\'s overall capital. Lloyds already employs around 300 people in Berlin including a full management team finance risk and human resources staff. It expects to shift no more than a handful of staff from Britain to complement the existing workforce the source said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: AFP  Malta would agree to the UK’s request for a Brexit extension providing the request was justified and would help lead to an orderly exit Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said on Friday.\\xa0“The ball is in the UK’s court after its Parliament voted against the present deal with the EU. It also voted against leaving the EU without a deal. So the current situation means the UK needs to either accept the deal or not exit the EU at all” the Prime Minister said in a statement.He said the European Union would not change its position because it would not compromise over the principles it was built upon: “It is not a case of stubbornness by the EU but a case of being realistic.”Dr Muscat explained that there were a number of challenges for the UK if given an extension. “Primarily the EU treaties are clear: the UK will be expected to organise the European Parliament elections in May even though these will not have any relevance in the long-term. It is also clear that the UK cannot have a veto on an EU budget that it will not be part of.” EU leaders on Friday called for clarity from Britain before considering any delay to Brexit after a series of chaotic votes by MPs just two weeks before the deeply divided country is due to leave the bloc. Quitting the EU after 46 years on March 29 remains the legal default unless EU leaders unanimously grant Britain an extension with the issue likely to dominate a March 21-22 EU summit in Brussels. The length of any possible delay will depend on the outcome of another parliamentary vote on the twice massively rejected Brexit deal struck by Ms\\xa0May with EU leaders. The government said it would ask for a \"technical\" delay until June 30 to pass necessary legislation if MPs finally approve the deal next week. If MPs vote against it for a third time the government has warned it will be forced to seek a much longer delay. \"It is very clear that the next steps the next proposal on how to move forward must come from Britain\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel\\'s spokesman Steffen Seibert said in Berlin on Friday. French President Emmanuel Macron\\'s office said that if the current deal is rejected again \"a clear and new alternative plan\" must be presented or else Britain would have to leave the EU with no agreement. The British government is hoping that talk of a long delay to Brexit will persuade hardliners in May\\'s own Conservative Party and its ally the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to get behind her deal. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Spain was standing between Theresa May and a Brexit deal as it threatened to derail an EU summit on Sunday if it does not get new assurances on having a say in the future of Gibraltar. As talks among Spanish British and EU officials continued on Saturday Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he was ready to thwart his British counterpart May\\'s hopes of seeing EU leaders sign off on promises of close ties with London after Britain leaves the bloc in March if he did not get his way. EU diplomats and officials said there was still no clear breakthrough on Saturday morning hours before some of the other leaders must set off for Brussels ahead of Sunday\\'s breakfast summit - few will be happy if plans change. Brussels diplomats and representatives of other governments across Europe said they did not believe Madrid would upset the careful choreography of Sunday\\'s summitry when May and her 27 EU peers will fly in for a couple of hours in the morning. But they also heard strong words from Spanish ministers that left them unwilling to call Sanchez\\'s bluff without further talks. On a visit to Cuba Sanchez said he had yet to receive assurances that any future decisions on Gibraltar would be decided in direct talks between London and Madrid. \"The guarantees are still not enough and Spain maintains its veto to Brexit. If there is a deal then it will be lifted\" he said when it was already late on Friday in Europe. \"If there is no deal... the European Council will most likely not take place.\" Spain can expect its European allies to swing more clearly behind its 300-year-old claims to sovereignty over \"The Rock\" a British naval base on its southern coast that is home to some 30000 people whose economy faces major questions after Brexit. But demands that extensive treaty documentation recently agreed between Brussels and London be tweaked to give Spain a bigger say over its implementation in regard to Gibraltar face resistance from Britain and EU allies who are wary that the whole edifice of the long-negotiated deal might unravel. \\'Proud people\\' Diplomats said there was no doubting the passion behind the Spanish arguments when advisers to the 27 EU leaders met in Brussels on Friday to prepare the summit: \"The Spanish are very proud people and this is absolutely important for them\" one participant in the talks told Reuters. \"We have to have a solution. I am quite sure we will have one.\" Some in Brussels stress that Sanchez is fighting a regional election in Andalusia the province that abuts Gibraltar next weekend and may want to play up the issue for home consumption. For him to force the cancellation of the summit or drag it out beyond the morning would incur the wrath of his peers. May is due to meet EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker on Saturday at 6pm (1700 GMT) and diplomats say that should be the moment they confirm that the Gibraltar issue is settled. May will then meet summit chair Donald Tusk. In Germany a government spokesman was confident a solution would be found in time for Sunday\\'s summit. Berlin had earlier said there could be no more technical negotiations at the summit and that Chancellor Angela Merkel could skip it if all the texts are not ready in advance. The biggest obstacle to the Brexit accord overall is the vehement opposition in the British parliament. Without its approval Britain could leave the bloc on March 29 without an agreement to mitigate economic and legal disruption. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Santa made a lacklustre attempt to deliver his traditional end of year rally yesterday as world stocks squeezed out a third day of gains and the pound and the euro both stayed firm after the latest bout of Brexit drama. UK Prime Minister Theresa May's survival in a late night no-confidence vote has not changed the markets' questions on Brexit but along with tentative signs of truces in the US-China trade war and Italy's budget feud it was enough to keep them jolly. The Nikkei and other Asian stocks had pushed roughly 1 percent higher and Europe enjoyed a largely uneventful morning. Even the long-awaited confirmation that the European Central Bank was ending its quantitative easing programme did little to rouse activity. The euro rose 0.2 per cent to $1.1390 having largely traded in a $1.16 and $1.12 range since August. That made the dollar a touch softer while the pound was up for a second day at $1.2665. Short-dated Italian bond yields – which move inversely to price – hit their lowest in six months after the country's government confirmed it would cut its deficit goal for 2019 potentially end-ing months of wrangling with Brussels. Two-year Italian bond yields tumbled to 0.51 per cent which took them back to where they were before a late May eruption of tensions triggered the worst day for short-term Italian debt in 25 years. Italy’s five-year and 10-year government bond yields dropped to their lowest level in 2 1/2 months while the closely watched Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread improved to its tightest since the start of October. On Brexit Ms May was heading to an EU summit in Brussels after her confidence vote win. Markets reckon Ms May’s continued premiership for now makes a “no deal” Brexit less likely at the margins. The pound was trading at $1.2670 as the first US trading started. In Asia gains were concentrated in Chinese shares with Chinese blue-chips up 1.5 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gaining 1.1 per cent. Japan's Nikkei stock index ended 1 per cent higher while Australian shares gained 0.1 per cent. Markets are slowly becoming less pessimistic about the chances of a Sino-US trade deal after a slew of news this week pointed to easing tensions between the two. In the commodities markets oil prices steadied under pressure from high inventories but buoyed by a drawdown in US crude stockpiles and the indications that the US-China trade war may be easing. Copper which is highly sensitive to China's fortunes also rose to a one-week high in the metals market at it approached $6200 a tonne although it remains badly beaten having lost almost 15 per cent this year. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The European Union\\'s 27 national ambassadors will try on Thursday to finalise an outline declaration of future ties between the bloc and the United Kingdom ahead of a planned summit on Sunday. Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29 but the sides must yet approve a divorce deal and the accompanying outline of their new ties in the future. EU leaders hope to rubber-stamp the accord at Sunday\\'s summit. British Prime Minister Theresa May failed to close all the gaps with the EU side in talks in Brussels on Wednesday and said she would return on Saturday hoping a last-minute intervention will be enough to push the accord over the line. Britain\\'s disputed territory of Gibraltar is the biggest sticking point with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez digging his heels in before a local election in Andalusia. Raising the stakes German diplomats told their EU colleagues in Brussels that Chancellor Angela Merkel would not come to Brussels on Sunday for any further negotiations meaning a text must be ready beforehand. \\'Nitpickers\\' One diplomat said that was a message aimed as much at Britain - where May\\'s plans have come under heavy fire from within her ruling Conservative Party - as at the bloc\\'s own \"nitpickers\" such as Spain or France which has sought more assurances of future access to Britain\\'s rich fishing waters. France and other countries have also asked for better guarantees that Britain would not be able to place products on the EU\\'s single market after Brexit at lower prices due to undercutting labour competition or labour standards. From her side May must also decide on a potential extension of a transition period after Brexit which the bloc said could last until the end of 2022 at the latest. Britain was also seeking frictionless trade in goods after Brexit which the EU does not allow without also following its rules on the free movement of people and services. The ambassadors of the other 27 EU member states were due to meet at 1000 GMT in Brussels to work on the outline declaration. This declaration running above 20 pages has yet to be agreed and published. It is due to form a package with Britain\\'s withdrawal agreement nearly 600 pages of a legal treaty that was published last week and prompted several of May\\'s ministers to quit. Pressure often builds up ahead of sensitive EU summits and the bloc is also known for sometimes missing its self-imposed deadlines. Diplomats warned however that the longer the Brexit deal remained unfinished the bigger the risk it could unravel. \"It may just be posturing on both sides everyone wants to look like a real fighter\" one diplomat said on Thursday. \"But they should keep in mind not to rock the boat too much.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

There is still time to find a solution to Britain\\'s exit from the EU German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Tuesday voicing optimism on a political deal over the tricky \"backstop\" that has stymied progress. Speaking to Japanese and German business leaders in Tokyo Merkel stressed that \"on the one hand time is pressing\" and businesses using \"just-in-time\" delivery processes could not afford lengthy customs procedures. However she added: \"From a political point of view there is still time. Two months is not a long time but there is still time and this should be used by all sides.\" Britain is poised to leave the EU at the end of March following a 2016 referendum. Merkel acknowledged the issue of the unpopular Northern Ireland backstop provision was \"complicating\" Brexit talks. The backstop is intended to ensure there is no return to a hard border with Ireland but Brexit supporters fear it will keep Britain tied to EU customs rules. She said the issue with the backstop was a \"problem that is precisely defined and therefore one should be able to find a precisely defined solution\". \"But this solution depends on the question of what the future relationship between Britain and the EU will be like and what type of trade deal we sign with each other\" added the chancellor.

Photo: Luke MacGregor/Reuters  George Soros the billionaire who earned fame by betting against the pound in 1992 said that a British vote tomorrow to leave the European Union would trigger a bigger and more disruptive sterling devaluation than the fall on Black Wednesday. Soros used Quantum Fund in 1992 to bet successfully that sterling was overvalued against the Deutsche mark forcing then-prime minister John Major to pull the pound out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). Soros in an opinion piece in The Guardian newspaper said that in the event of a British exit or Brexit the pound would fall by at least 15 per cent and possibly more than 20 per cent to below $1.15 from its current level of around $1.46. “The value of the pound would decline precipitously. It would also have an immediate and dramatic impact on financial markets investment prices and jobs” Soros who is 85 said in The Guardian. “I would expect this devaluation to be bigger and also more disruptive than the 15 per cent devaluation that occurred in September 1992 when I was fortunate enough to make a substantial profit for my hedge fund investors.” Soros ranked as the world’s 23rd richest person by Forbes magazine with a fortune of $24.9 billion said the Bank of England would not cut rates after a British exit and that there would be few monetary policy tools left to ease a recession or a fall in British house prices. He also pointed to the “very large” current account deficit in the United Kingdom and said a post-Brexit devaluation would be unlikely to improve manufacturing as trading conditions would be too uncertain to undertake new investments or hire workers. Hungarian-born Soros said the scale of the sterling devaluation would compare with 1967 when then-prime minister Harold Wilson devalued the pound to $2.40 from $2.80. Speculators Soros said would be eager to exploit a Brexit situation to profit. “Today there are speculative forces in the markets much bigger and more powerful. And they will be eager to exploit any miscalculations by the British government or British voters” Soros said. “Brexit would make some people very rich – but most voters considerably poorer” Soros said. Members of Britain’s ‘Leave’ campaign say some bankers big companies and politicians are trying to scare British voters with overblown warnings about the financial and economic impact of a Brexit. Justice Secretary Michael Gove one of the leading members of the Vote Leave campaign dismissed Soros’s warning saying that the billionaire had advocated British membership of the eurozone. “The truth is that economic forecasters like George Soros have got things wrong in the past. They were the people who argued that we should join the single currency; the single currency as you know has brought economic misery” Gove told BBC radio. Opponents of EU membership say Britain could prosper if it cut itself free from what they portray as a doomed German-dominated project in excessive debt-funded welfare spending. The world’s biggest banks including Citi and Goldman Sachs will draft in senior traders to work through the night following Britain’s referendum on EU membership set to be among the most volatile 24 hours for markets in a quarter of a century. A vote to leave the EU tomorrow would spook investors by undermining post-World War II attempts at European integration and placing a question mark over the future of the UK and its $2.9 trillion economy. Citi Deutsche Bank JPMorgan Goldman Sachs HSBC Barclays Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds are among those banks planning to have senior staff and traders working or on call in London as results start to dribble in after polls close at 2100 GMT according to sources. “British voters are now grossly underestimating the true costs of Brexit” Soros said. “Too many believe that a vote to leave the EU will have no effect on their personal financial position. This is wishful thinking.” Polls and surveys indicate British opinion is so divided that the outcome is too close to call. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Confidence in prospects for the global eco\\xadnomy has been dented following Britain’s vote to leave the European Union with a growing view that monetary policy is a fading force and many governments now need to borrow and spend Reuters polls showed. Broad worries about political risks are also on the rise everywhere and not restricted just to Brexit’s repercussions and a failed coup in Turkey. The US is entering a period of heightened uncertainty too leading up to November elections. The overarching worry is this more dangerous phase is coming at an unwelcome time when central bankers don’t have anywhere near the clout they had after the collapse of Lehman Brothers to deal with another major economic or financial downturn. “Given how fragile the global economy is nearly eight years after the start of the global financial crisis the last thing it needed was the type of jolt provided by the UK’s Brexit vote” wrote Janet Henry global chief economist at HSBC. “We suspect fiscal policy will likely have a larger role to play in many countries from here.” Reuters polls of over 500 economists across Asia Europe and the Americas reveal downgrades or at best no change to growth forecasts compared with previous months as well as an incrementally weaker inflation across most countries. Even in the US where most of the economic optimism has been focused in the developed world there has been a slight downgrade to the growth outlook and no discernible rise in inflation expectations despite a hot job market. The outlook for global growth this year has held at three per cent but was trimmed by 0.1 percentage point to 3.2 per cent for 2017 weaker than the 3.4 per cent forecast last week by the International Monetary Fund. The G20 finance ministers and central bankers are meeting in China this weekend with repercussions from Brexit and dwindling policy options expected to dominate talks. Given how fragile the global economy is the last thing it needed was the type of jolt provided by the UK’s Brexit vote Concerns about the inability of major economies to generate any amount of inflation have driven financial markets through wild gyrations over the past year despite the fact that US stocks are now near record highs and sovereign bond yields are near record lows almost everywhere. Expectations for further easing from the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan as well as the European Central Bank have calmed financial markets somewhat and are likely to reinforce the existing trend toward higher equity and bond prices as the extra cash has to go somewhere. Most economists polled from around the globe said developed economies that can should now ramp up their fiscal spending as Canada and Japan have done recently. Asked which countries need to opt for some form of fiscal expansion in the next six months most economists chose major European countries many of which are currently pursuing austerity measures. Germany was the top pick. Growth across much of the rest of the world is forecast to be uninspiring. Britain’s economy is expected to slide back into recession in the coming year following its vote to leave the EU pushing the Bank of England to cut interest rates and restart its printing presses next month. With a still-subdued economic outlook for the largest economies in the eurozone and the added uncertainty of Brexit the European Central Bank is likely to extend and alter its asset purchase programme possibly by September. The Bank of Japan in an attempt to boost inflation is expected to ease policy later this month. That would double up with Shinzo Abe’s plan for a fresh round of fiscal stimulus following an election win in the upper house. Emerging market economies are not expected to fare much better either. South Africa looks to remain gripped by weak growth and persistently high inflation while Brazil in a much worse kind of mess is predicted to escape recession next year. China’s economic growth is expected to cool to 6.5 per cent this year and 6.3 per cent in 2017 even as the government steps up fiscal spending and the central bank loosens policy further to prevent a sharper slowdown. India is one of the few exceptions in emerging markets with a stable outlook and is likely to maintain a faster growth rate than China over the next few years. “India has settled into a comfortable stride. Growth looks impressive even if that’s not always matched by feelings on the ground” wrote Pranjul Bhandari chief economist India at HSBC. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  European Union leaders will endorse a stiff set of divorce terms for Britain at a summit today rejoicing in a rare show of unity in adversity but well aware that may start to fray once negotiations begin. Meeting for the first time since British Prime Minister Theresa May formally triggered a two-year countdown to Brexit in late March the 27 other EU leaders will lose little time over a lunch in Brussels in approving an 8-page set of negotiating guidelines hammered out by their diplomats over the past month. Those will bind Michel Barnier their chief negotiator to seek a deal that secures the rights of 3 million EU expats living in Britain ensure London pays tens of billions of euros Brussels thinks it will be owed and avoids destabilising peace by creating a hard EU-UK border across the island of Ireland. They also rule out discussing the free trade deal May wants until they see progress on agreeing those key withdrawal terms. \"Before discussing the future we have to sort out our past\" summit chair Donald Tusk said as leaders gathered. In a mark of how last year\\'s Brexit vote has called into question the unity of the United Kingdom itself leaders will also offer Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny a pledge that if Northern Ireland which voted against Brexit ever unites with his country it will automatically be in the EU. The leaders may spend more time in discussions including with Barnier on what criteria they may use to judge come the autumn whether he has made sufficient progress to warrant a start on trade talks. They may also talk about how to manage a transition after Britain leaves in 2019 to a new relationship likely to take many more years to finalise. That decision on what is \"sufficient\" is the kind of debate that can poison relations as the 27 seek to protect national interests. Also contentious will be which countries scoop the prizes of hosting two EU agencies set to be moved from London. With most of the 27 offering to house the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and several wanting the European Banking Authority (EBA) Tusk and EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker will propose criteria for making the choices to avoid unseemly rows. \"We need to remain united as EU 27\" Tusk said. \"It is only then that we will be able to conclude the negotiations which means that our unity is also in the UK\\'s interest.\" \"We are remarkably united\" one national leader who will be at the table told Reuters. \"But then it\\'s always easy to be united on what you want before you start negotiating.\" DIFFERENCES Among possible differences the priorities of poor eastern states are to secure residency rights for their many workers in Britain and British money for the EU budget; Germany and others set store by a smooth transition to a new free trade agreement. Unwonted unity has been forged by the shock of Brexit; it breaks a taboo and raises fears of further break-up at the hands of nationalists like French far-right leader Marine Le Pen. She will contest her country\\'s presidential election run-off on May 7 though few expect her to beat centrist Emmanuel Macron. The EU sees it as vital that Britain not be seen to profit from Brexit to avoid encouraging other states to follow suit. However some officials are also voicing concern that the process of weaving maximalist demands into the negotiating text could risk souring the atmosphere with May who expects to start talks shortly after the UK election she has called for June 8. Senior officials in Brussels believe the risk of a breakdown in talks that could see Britain simply walking out into chaotic legal limbo in March 2019 has diminished since May wrote to Tusk on March 29 in terms recognising she would have to compromise. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel facing her own election in September warned Britain this week against lingering \"illusions\" of how much access it would retain to EU markets. And some diplomats fear the tone of EU negotiating demands could sound too aggressive and create a popular backlash in Britain that might then make it hard for May to agree a deal. \"These are legally solid arguments\" one said noting for example a demand Britain not only lose the EMA and EBA but also pay the moving costs. \"But we don\\'t want to sound too punitive.\" Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said: \"They are maybe not any more in our family but they are still our neighbours so we should have respect for each other.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The European Union told Britain today to spell out what it will pay Brussels for when it leaves the bloc in 2019 or face more delay in talks on future trade ties that are vital for British business. After negotiations in Brussels the first in a month Brexit Secretary David Davis said during a news conference with his EU counterpart Michel Barnier it was time for \"political discussions\" to break a deadlock that has left both sides frustrated about a lack of progress. \"Political\" talks has in the past been code for Prime Minister Theresa May addressing fellow EU leaders directly over the heads of Barnier and the EU executive in order to square a circle in which Brussels will not address the future without a firm line from London on settling what the EU sees as past debts and May will not settle without assurances about future trade. May is due at a Brussels summit on Dec. 14-15 but EU officials insist that any breakthrough must be agreed at lower level first and weeks in advance to let the other 27 members agree a joint position. Progress in December is important for May as businesses seek clarity by the new year when many will take investment decisions dependent on conditions after Brexit. A British budget due on Nov. 22 will however complicate the task for May in persuading hardline Brexit supporters of any need to meet Brussels\\' demand for tens of billions of euros to cover liabilities incurred in 44 years of EU membership. Barnier stressed that he was not looking for a number from London but for a clearer undertaking than May gave in September on how far Britain would \"honour its obligations\". \"It is absolutely vital if we are to achieve sufficient progress in December\" Barnier told reporters adding not all details had to be settled but there needed to be \"sincere and real progress\". The clarifications should come within the next two weeks Barnier said: \"If that\\'s not the case then we will continue and that will pull back the opening of discussions on the future.\" \"POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS\" He said progress had to be made on all three key issues of the divorce talks - the money the rights of EU citizens in Britain and how to avoid a \"hard border\" with EU-member Ireland. Davis said both sides made substantial technical progress on all the issues that need to be addressed. \"This is now about moving into the political discussions that would enable both of us to move forward\" he said. British discussions with other national governments do not appear to have breached the unity of the 27 for now. And German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron the bloc\\'s most powerful leaders have taken a particularly tough line on the money issue in Brussels. The EU executive has said Britain will owe it around 60 billion euros when it leaves. London has challenged the legal reasoning behind that but has not offered its own figure. One thing that was clarified on Friday was exactly when Britain would leave the Union. The EU had previously defined \"Brexit hour\" as \"midnight\" on March 29 2019 exactly two years after May triggered the process. But it was unclear whether that meant midnight in Brussels or London. May and Barnier made statements on Friday stating that Brexit will happen in London at 11 p.m. (2300 GMT) on Friday March 29. That will be midnight in the EU capital. Davis repeated the declaration made by May in September in Florence that EU countries will not need to pay more or receive less for the remainder of the current EU long-term budget ending in December 2020: \"The UK will honour the commitments we made during the period of our membership\" he said. Barnier said both sides moved ahead on citizens\\' rights and that Britain gave \"useful\" clarifications on a process through which EU citizens could obtain a \"settled status\" but the EU needed reassurances on how such a system would work. He said issues related to family reunification the right to export social security benefits and the role of the European Court of Justice still need work. On the problems of avoiding a \"hard border\" between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland Davis and Barnier said more work must be done. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

After more than 13 hours of speeches for and against the legislation which May says is essential for Brexit but critics describe as a Conservative government power grab lawmakers voted 326 to 290 in favour of moving the EU withdrawal bill or repeal bill to the next stage of a lengthy lawmaking process. Many fell in step with the government which said a vote against the legislation would force Britain into a chaotic exit from the EU rather than a smooth departure as the country would lack laws and a regulatory framework to steer the process. May weakened by the loss of her majority in a June election now faces a battle against politicians who want to force amendments to the bill first in the lower house of parliament and then in Britain\\'s unelected upper chamber. \"Earlier this morning parliament took a historic decision to back the will of the British people and vote for a bill which gives certainty and clarity ahead of our withdrawal from the European Union\" May said in a statement. Brexit protesters outside Westminster. Photo:: Reuters \"Although there is more to do this decision means we can move on with negotiations with solid foundations and we continue to encourage MPs (lawmakers) from all parts of the UK to work together in support of this vital piece of legislation.\" Her justice minister urged lawmakers to back the bill and signalled that the government would listen to the concerns of lawmakers despite describing some of their criticism as being \"exaggerated up to and beyond the point of hyperbole\". The bill seeks largely to \\'copy and paste\\' EU law into British legislation to ensure Britain has functioning laws and the same regulatory framework as the bloc at the moment of Brexit to offer some reassurance for companies. Referendum rift But the often impassioned debate in the 650-seat parliament underlined the rifts exposed by last year\\'s EU referendum not only in Britain\\'s main parties but also in the country. The opposition Labour Party had called on its lawmakers to vote against the bill if the government failed to make concessions. But seven rebelled with some saying they had to respect the demands of their pro-Brexit voters. \"This is a deeply disappointing result\" said Labour\\'s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer. \"This bill is an affront to parliamentary democracy and a naked power grab by government ministers ... It will make the Brexit process more uncertain and lead to division and chaos when we need unity and clarity.\" The government has defended the bill by saying it will allow Britain to become \"masters of our own laws\" but it also gives ministers wide-ranging powers to amend laws to make them work domestically often by interchanging the word \\'EU\\' for Britain. But lawmakers both in Labour and May\\'s governing Conservative Party expressed fears the government would make substantial changes to legislation without consulting parliament - a charge the government has denied. Despite the victory for a government now dependent on the support of Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party to secure a working majority ministers will face attempts by both Conservative and Labour lawmakers to change the bill. Some want assurances that the government will not misuse its power others want to make sure the protections of certain workers rights are also written into the bill before allowing it to move to the unelected upper house of parliament. The process is expected to take months to complete and both houses should agree the final wording before it can be passed. \"Labour will seek to amend and remove the worst aspects from the bill as it passes through parliament\" Starmer said. \"But the flaws are so fundamental it\\'s hard to see how this bill could ever be made fit for purpose.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British and EU chief negotiators laid out their opening positions in a first full round of Brexit talks that confirmed some common ground on how Britain will leave the European Union but little compromise on key disputes. David Davis and Michel Barnier said on Thursday that four \"constructive\" days of \"robust\" talks between their respective teams in Brussels had helped \"build trust\" and explain many of the details of their competing visions for a divorce deal. But they also confirmed \"fundamental divergence\" on how to protect the rights of expatriate citizens stranded by Britain\\'s walkout and a stalemate on settling London\\'s EU accounts. Barnier complained the British had yet to give their arguments for disputing a bill Brussels puts at tens of billions of euros. With talks finally under way 13 months after Britons voted to leave due to concerns about immigration and sovereignty Davis echoed Barnier\\'s impatient catchphrase \"the clock is ticking\". The Brexit secretary said British officials would work \"at pace\" for a deal to avoid a disorderly exit in March 2019. But Barnier the former French cabinet minister who is chief negotiator for the European Commission said London must start explaining how it sees a financial settlement with Brussels or there would be no opening of discussions which Britain hopes for by the end of the year on a future post-Brexit free trade deal. British officials question the EU\\'s argumentation but said it was far from clear they would produce a counterproposal in detail in the coming weeks on how much they are willing to pay. Davis was asked whether Britain would now agree with the EU that whatever the final \"Brexit bill\" would be it would mean a net payment from London to Brussels and not vice versa as some British ministers have suggested. He refused to answer however referring only to a government statement last week that Britain would settle rights and obligations to the EU after Brexit. Barnier acknowledged that as positive and British officials say it was meant to remove a bone of contention this week. Prime Minister Theresa May weakened by an election upset last month seems unwilling to risk a public backlash by accepting it will definitely pay Brussels but negotiators now take it as read. The EU side has stressed it is not aiming to put forward a figure soon - the Commission has offered a ballpark number of €60 billion that Britain ridicules - but wants to agree a \"methodology\" on how it will be calculated ideally by October. Citizens\\' rights On citizens rights negotiators on both sides told reporters that British rejection of the EU insistence on the rights of 3 million Europeans in Britain being guaranteed by recourse to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) remains a major sticking point though there are several other differences on what rights they can get. \"We are now moving in the same direction\" Barnier said of the citizens\\' rights dimension. \"But there is a fundamental divergence on how to guarantee those rights.\" A chart drawn up by negotiators broke down 44 topics raised in the two sides\\' offers on expats. Of these exactly half 22 were marked green for agreement and 14 were red. As well as rejecting ECJ oversight - seen in London as \"judicial imperialism\" - Britain wants to limit rights granted to future children or spouses and to subject those it will give permanent residency to criminal records checks both areas where the EU either disagrees or at least has some concerns. Britain demands that its million or more citizens living on the continent be entitled not just to stay in the country they are in but move residence freely around the bloc. However this is resisted by the EU which notes that Britain wants to strip residency rights from their citizens if they spend two years living in the EU. There are also differences on mutual recognition of social security and welfare payments. Irish question Davis and Barnier said discussions on efforts to limit the impact on peace in Northern Ireland from a new UK-EU border with the Irish Republic showed a common will. The EU asked Britain to provide more detail on how it foresaw its pre-EU Common Travel Area with Ireland continuing to operate after Brexit. Noting the week had delivered progress on settling a range of other loose ends such as Britain\\'s withdrawal from the Euratom nuclear monitoring body and how to deal with ongoing EU court cases involving Britain Davis said: \"All in all the ... negotiations have given us a lot to be positive about.\" Barnier stressed he was still expecting \"clarification\" from London on many issues at the next round of talks in late August. He must now report back to the other 27 EU governments whom he must keep on board through the complex negotiations. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Today is an important step on the road to delivering a smooth and orderly Brexit and forging our deep and special future partnership. https://t.co/PSaATiA17n Updated at 1pm The European Union agreed on Friday to move talks forward with London on Britain\\'s exit from the bloc as leaders warmed to the British premier but there was little clarity on trade issues and Austria warned the Irish border issue remained a \"riddle\". On the second day of a summit in Brussels leaders said that \"sufficient progress\" was made after a deal on citizens\\' rights the Irish border and Britain\\'s outstanding payments giving negotiators a mandate to move onto the main phase of talks. \"EU leaders agree to move on to the second phase of Brexit talks. Congratulations PM Theresa May\" European Council President Donald Tusk who chairs EU summits said on Twitter. Leaders said that \"sufficient progress\" was made after a deal on citizens\\' rights the Irish border and Britain\\'s outstanding payments Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said those talks would likely formally start in March. A day after she suffered a defeat in parliament over her blueprint for quitting the EU May won applause from her peers on Thursday evening. She said she was on course to deliver Brexit and urged them to speed up the talks to unravel more than 40 years of membership. But several hours later as leaders reconvened European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Italy\\'s Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni warned that the hardest decisions were still to come as Britain tries to extricate itself from rules agreed over years in the bloc. Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern went further saying even a primary school student could see that the \"first phase\" deal on the Irish border would come back to haunt the talks because it was impossible for Britain to leave the bloc\\'s single market while avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. \"There cannot be any border controls between Northern and southern Ireland there cannot be border controls between Northern Ireland and the UK but there can between UK and the EU\" he said. \"So our primary school students can see that there is a riddle to be solved.\" As May left to return to London - she did not join the other 27 leaders for further discussions on Brexit and the eurozone - she said she was eager to move on. The next more decisive phase of the negotiations will further test her authority by exposing the deep rifts among her top team of ministers over what Britain should become after Brexit The EU is willing to start talks next month on a roughly two-year transition period to ease Britain out after March 2019 but has asked for more detail from London on what it wants before it will open trade negotiations from March of next year. Ireland\\'s Prime Minister Leo Varadkar cautioned that there were \"quite divergent opinions\" on how a new relationship and transition would look. EU officials are divided over whether Britain should continue to receive the full unfettered economic benefits of EU membership during a transition after it leaves even if it loses political representation in Brussels. A British government official said the prime minister was approaching the next phase which will discuss a transition period as well as the terms of the future trading relationship \"with ambition and creativity\". German Chancellor Angela Merkel gave her stamp of approval but cautioned time was running out. \"We made clear that Theresa May has made an offer that should allow us to say that we have seen sufficient progress\" she told reporters. \"Nevertheless there are still a lot of problems to solve. And time is of the essence.\" Tusk will call May on Friday to update her. May weakened after losing her Conservative Party\\'s majority in a June election has so far carried her divided government and party with her as she negotiated the first phase of talks on how much Britain should pay to leave the EU the border with Ireland and the status of EU citizens in Britain. But the next more decisive phase of the negotiations will further test her authority by exposing the deep rifts among her top team of ministers over what Britain should become after Brexit. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

While delivering one of his many erudite speeches in the late 1980s President Emeritus Ugo Mifsud Bonnici then minister of education referred to Malta as having enjoyed a telescoping of history. As a much younger man I listened to him explain further how global events had always left their footprint on our archipelago with occupiers always being whoever was dominant on the world stage during any particular period. That much is true but there are also instances where our history seems to have been very much in anticipation of and a key determinant to global events. Being a nation that wakes up every day in the firm belief that we are the centre of the world I am quite convinced that many if not most will agree with me outright even without reading what I have to say. After all ‘we are small in size but big in heart’ ‘punch above our weight’ and ‘have an important role to play’ etc. For the benefit of those who require some pseudo-historical nudging before they can accept the obvious let me start by going with the universally acknowledged fact (another term for cliché) that Valletta the 2018 demi-European Capital of Culture was the precursor of the modern day European Union. Bringing together the ruling houses of the major European countries of the day the Order of Saint John had its Spanish who were divided into the Castille and Aragon langues with the latter also catering for the always-want-to-be-separate Catalonians. The Order also included France Italy and Germany. The enemy then was the Ottoman Empire (now Turkey) but I shall refrain from expounding on that and drawing modern-day parallels for reasons of political correctness and sensibilities. The first city built to house a union of Europeans was Valletta What more do I need to say? The first city built to house a union of Europeans was definitely Valletta and Brussels would eventually just play the copycat centuries later. And what you are probably asking does Valletta have in common with Brexit and what’s this about a ‘first’ Brexit? There my friends lies the heart of the matter (apologies to Graham Greene). The devil lies in the detail and there is one such detail which proves how far ahead of its time Valletta was way back in 1566 when being a mere demi-capital of culture was not in its grandiose plans. To make sure it would be a true forerunner if not outright blueprint of today’s European Union Valletta had already had its first Brexit. When the Knights of Saint John (of so many places) first arrived in Malta in 1530 all in disarray after having been unceremoniously kicked out of Rhodes they were made up of eight langues one for every point of their cross. The eighth never-mentioned langue was… yes English. In Northwest Street (Triq il-Majjistral) Birgu subsequently rebaptised Vittoriosa prior to being abandoned by the Knights one can still find the Auberge d’Angleterre. The building served many purposes in the past including as a local library for many years after its 1988 restoration and now as a local health centre. Valletta on the other hand does not have an Auberge d’Angleterre as one was never built. Between 1530 and 1566 the 16th-century Brexit occurred with Henry VIII taking time between wives to pull England out of the Order and out of the Catholic religion in general. Building a whole auberge for just the one remaining knight Sir Oliver Starkey even if he was very close to the man who gave his name to the city was a bit over the top. English interests in the Order were still kept alive however just in case. No way could it have been the French entrusted with handling English interests so an Anglo-Bavarian langue was established in the Auberge de Baviere. Little did it matter that there were no Anglos left – their influence had to remain and the alphabet determined that ‘Anglo’ had to come before ‘Bavarian’ in the name of the langue. And there you have it. Not only was Valletta the precursor and prototype of today’s European Union but it’s planners also had the foresight to anticipate the Brexit black spot thus accentuating the beauty of Valletta’s European Union character then and now. No surprise then that Brexit negotiations and dealings will be at their most intense while Valletta is a capital of European culture. It could not have been otherwise.

Updated 2pm British Prime Minister Theresa May signalled on Thursday she would consider extending a so-called transition period \"for a matter of months\" after Britain leaves the European Union a move her critics say is a betrayal of Brexit. Less than six months before Britain quits the EU in its biggest shift in policy for more than 40 years Brexit talks have stalled over how to deal with their only land border between the British province of Northern Ireland and Ireland. At an EU summit in Brussels while the mood was more upbeat about the willingness for a deal to ease Britain\\'s exit several leaders and diplomats said May had offered nothing new to strike the kind of breakthrough needed to move forward. The problem centres on a so-called backstop - an insurance policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland a former focal point for sectarian tensions if a future trading relationship is not in place in time. Extending the transition period could mean that if a future partnership is not ready a backstop which so far has been unpalatable to the British side would not have to be triggered. But even an extension will not get rid of the EU\\'s insistence that such a backstop must be agreed to secure a deal.\\xa0A French official said any extension would come with conditions attached \"A further idea that has emerged and it is an idea at this stage is to create an option to extend the implementation period for a matter of months and it would only be a matter months\" May told reporters on the second day of the summit. \"But the point is this is not expected to be used because we are working to ensure that we have that future relationship in place by the end of December 2020.\" A senior British government official tried to play down the significance of May\\'s consideration of such an extension saying it had only \"come up in negotiations in recent days\" and that it was one of several options to help move the talks on - something London desperately wants to see. And a French official said any extension would come with conditions attached - it would not be automatic it would be decided closer to the time and that it would have to be agreed by the leaders of the 27 other EU nations probably unanimously. \"TRUST\" May has tried to use the summit in Brussels - once seen as the stage for a possible breakthrough after more than a year of talks - to offer a softer tone to her EU counterparts after another such meeting last month ended in acrimony. Before leaving them to dine on Wednesday May called for cooperation. \"The last stage will need courage trust and leadership on both sides\" she told leaders according to an official. Her plea was met by some understanding of her predicament. May\\'s plans have been criticised by all sides at home -\\xa0Brexit campaigners accuse her of making Britain a vassal state EU supporters say they offer the worst of all worlds and others have expressed frustration over the lengthy talks. She also faces a rebellion from her parliamentary partners Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party which has threatened to vote against her government\\'s budget if she concedes to the EU\\'s demands over the backstop. They say the proposal would tear Northern Ireland from the rest of Britain. Diane Dodds an EU lawmaker from the DUP said the extension did not ease her party\\'s fears. \"All very well but this doesn\\'t do anything to actually change the backstop ... Therefore it does not address any concerns it offers no reassurance.\" With a crucial vote in parliament on any deal May who lost her Conservative Party\\'s majority in an election last year risks a damaging defeat. That could trigger a leadership contest a so-called no deal Brexit and even a new election. The parliamentary vote and May\\'s political struggles were the focus of much of the other EU leaders\\' dinner late on Wednesday an aide to French President Emmanuel Macron said. But a senior EU diplomat was more blunt. \"There is nothing. We have nothing. For now we have a no-deal\" the diplomat said adding leaders were waiting for Britain\\'s budget due to be presented to parliament in late October to be passed. With the talks stalled and little prospect of a quickening of pace anytime soon many Brexit supporters and even critics of Britain\\'s departure are airing their frustration over an exit which some campaigners had said would be the easiest deal ever. And the suggestion - first made by EU negotiators - that Britain could stay firmly in the EU\\'s sphere for longer than the 21 months expected has fired up those who already say Britain has already given up too much in the negotiations. \"Many Conservative MPs (lawmakers) are making clear to the government that we won\\'t support legislation seeking to prolong transition and large payments for no good reason\" said John Redwood a Conservative Brexit supporter. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Arch eurosceptic Nigel Farage led a hundred anxious Brexit backers Saturday through the mud of England\\'s industrial northeast towards London demanding certainty that Britain leaves the EU this month. The 270-mile (435-kilometre) march from Sunderland to the capital\\'s parliament will conclude on March 29 - the date Britain was scheduled to pull out of the European Union after nearly half a century. But lawmakers\\' refusal to back the divorce deal Prime Minister Theresa May struck with Brussels has put Britain\\'s divorce from the EU in some doubt. May will try this week to push her pact through the divided House of Commons for a third time.Nigel Farage If it is approved the prime minister will ask the remaining 27 EU leaders to sign off on a Brexit deadline extension through June to allow parliament to pass the necessary legislation. Another rejection of the deal and May will be forced to seek a longer delay that some EU leaders have said could last through the end of next year. \"Sunderland is very symbolic. It was the Sunderland result on the night of the (2016 Brexit) referendum that made us think -- wow this is going to happen\" Farage said before setting off on the march in a brand new pair of sneakers and trench coat. \"I believe we are witnessing a betrayal. I think we are witnessing in terms of our nation\\'s democratic history one of the saddest chapters.\" Farage was a poster child of the pro-Brexit effort whose calls for barriers to migrants and sovereignty from EU rules struck a cord in working-class cities such as Sunderland. He resigned as leader of the populist UK Independence Party (UKIP) after the 2016 vote and now heads a new Brexit Party in the European Parliament. \"The country is actually united around \\'Let\\'s get on with this\\'\" he told AFP. \"The overwhelming majority say \\'Let\\'s end this agony\\'.\" \\'Democratic vote ignored\\'\\xa0 Some Britons who voted to stay in Europe hope an extension will give London a chance to negotiate much closer ties than those in May\\'s current deal. Others will try to use the time to force another Brexit referendum that could overturn the first one\\'s result. Such talk is anathema to Farage and his supporters. \"We are a little forgotten by the politicians\" retired banker Christopher Treggelis said. \"My democratic vote has been ignored\" pensioner Steve Coward added as the group set off along their North Sea route for the town of Hartlepool some 20 miles to the south. Organisers are providing meals and accommodations to \"core marchers\" for a one-off payment of £50. \"I\\'m taking to my second right which is to protest peacefully about the parliament ignoring my democratic vote\" said Coward. The marchers brandished Union Jacks and signs reading \"Democracy\" and \"Liberty\". Some said that any economic pain caused by the breakup would be short-lived and worth the benefits of greater independence. Sunderland store owner Janice McBeth said she was sure \"this country will thrive\" down the line. \"I’m not naive - it might be difficult a few shortages trade barriers\" she said. \"But it will be sorted out.\" The march is designed to echo similar processions witnessed in England\\'s northeastern coalfields in the 1930s that saw workers protest poverty and the closure of a big shipyard. The Jarrow March of 1936 was the most famous. A few hundred reached London and were treated as heros once they returned home. Sunderland has been shaken in the past month by news that Nissan is ending production of its luxury Infinity models -- a reversing a decision to build a new sports utility vehicle -- at the local plant. Farage admitted that he intends to cover just a third of the trek to London. \"Unfortunately I have a European summit to go to one or two things like that\" he told the BBC. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: AFP  If as expected Theresa May loses the Brexit “meaningful vote” on January 15 the UK government will have three days to prepare a “plan B” and present it to parliament. MPs would then have the chance to scrutinise this plan. As the UK’s withdrawal date of March 29 is written into UK law time is of the essence. There are six possible options for the prime minister at this stage. Since postponing the first vote on the withdrawal agreement in December May has sought reassurances from the heads of the other 27 member states about the UK’s future relationship with the bloc and the nature of the so-called “Irish backstop” to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. While such discussions could continue should May lose the vote the timescale makes this unlikely. If the assurances the prime minister has sought from Brussels in the four weeks since December are not sufficient to get the deal through parliament it’s unlikely she would be able to make significant further progress within three days that could revive the deal. Many EU member states have insisted the text of the agreement cannot be changed at this stage. There is equally unlikely to be sufficient time to agree an alternative deal based for example upon a Norway plus or a Canada model.   Read more: Four options for UK trade after Brexit   Rather than focus on the nature of a new type of deal the prime minister may ask the EU for more time to restart negotiations extending the two-year article 50 deadline which governs the UK’s withdrawal process. This would need the approval of other member states and MPs but it could potentially avoid the hard deadline of March 29. Even if such an extension were to be agreed it’s unclear what changes to the existing deal would be acceptable to the EU27 who have consistently refused to discuss options to alter the text. Any further negotiations would also have an added complication by overlapping with the next European parliamentary elections scheduled for May. To overcome the deadlock in parliament May has the option of suggesting another referendum or public vote – albeit this is something she has previously ruled out. Here multiple options exist. One could be a referendum on the basis of the current withdrawal agreement – asking the public a simply yes/no “do you support this deal?” If accepted this may give legitimacy to a deal that allows the UK to leave the EU on March 29. However if May’s deal is rejected in a public vote as well as in parliament it would be very difficult to resurrect it in any form. Others including the People’s Vote campaign have proposed a public vote which includes the option of remaining in the EU – though Brexiteers would argue this is an attempt to overturn the result of the 2016 referendum. Another way of gauging the public’s opinion without being seen to overturn the initial referendum result would be to call a general election. Political parties would be able to present competing Brexit proposals and the public could choose between these. It would also give the Conservatives a chance to change the arithmetic within the House of Commons theoretically making it easier (assuming they won an election) for the new parliament to pass May’s deal at a second attempt.   Read more: What happens if parliament rejects a Brexit deal?   An election in itself would not solve the issues generated by parliament rejecting the deal. If the next parliament didn’t immediately seek to extend article 50 it would still face the same March 29 deadline. Under British law there must be a minimum of 25 days between the dissolution of parliament and the general election. If the election were to be called immediately after the vote on January 15 the earliest a government could be in position is February 11 (even that would assume an unprecedented weekend election). This would leave the new government just 46 days to obtain parliamentary support for a solution to avoid Britain exiting the EU without a deal. In December 2019 the European Court of Justice ruled that Britain could unilaterally revoke article 50 without affecting its membership of the union providing there was a genuine intention to remain a member of the EU. This could not simply be used as an extension mechanism and would commit the UK to remaining part of the EU. However this would be unpopular with MPs who have promised to respect the result of the referendum and is unlikely to gain a majority of support in parliament. If May loses the January 15 vote and none of the above options materialise the UK will leave the EU at on March 29 without a deal and with no transition period. This date can only be altered if parliament explicitly votes to do so. Amid all the uncertainty one thing is clear: each scenario presents its own questions and problems. In many ways these are the same questions that have been left unanswered since the 2016 referendum. For example how can the UK talk of following the homogeneous “will of the people” given the different options discussed during the referendum campaign and the variety and complexity of issues that influenced voters’ decisions? Far from resolving the issue of Britain’s membership of the EU the questions raised by the referendum result must be explored and answered before the UK can agree upon a new relationship with the EU.

European leaders moved Wednesday to head off British Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s bid to rewrite the Brexit divorce deal warning they will not budge.\\xa0 Having thrown out the exit deal May negotiated with the EU divided British lawmakers voted Tuesday to send her back to get an Irish border \"backstop\" clause removed. May seized on this as a chance to prevent Britain crashing out of the European Union on March 29 without an agreement on the terms of the split vowing to return to Brussels to demand changes to the text. But even she admits she faces a formidable challenge convincing Brussels to re-open an accord that took 18 excruciating months to conclude and European leaders are so far united in dismissing any such manoeuvre.\\xa0 \"It\\'s an extraordinary situation when a prime minister and a government negotiates a deal and then goes back and during the ratification process votes against their own deal\" Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney told RTE radio. \"That\\'s like saying in a negotiation \\'Well either you give me what I want or I\\'m jumping out of the window\\'.\" In Brussels ahead of a keenly anticipated speech by EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker frustrated officials including Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier insisted the remaining 27 EU members were united.\\xa0 A spokesman for EU Council President Donald Tusk swiftly insisted the Brexit deal was \"not open for renegotiation\". Echoing earlier warnings from French President Emmanuel Macron and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz German leader Angela Merkel\\'s spokesman said reopening the deal was \"not on the agenda\". And Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar insisted \"renegotiation is not on the table.\" The \"backstop\" written into the negotiated deal is seen by EU leaders as an insurance policy against disrupting the Irish peace process.\\xa0 It could legally lock the UK into EU trade rules indefinitely in order to keep the Irish border free-flowing. Guy Verhofstadt who heads the European Parliament\\'s six-member Brexit steering group said the backstop clause was \"absolutely needed\" and there was hardly room to change the deal. Going further group member Philippe Lamberts was scathing. \"Saying you\\'re against the backstop is like saying you\\'re against bad weather. You might not like it but you can\\'t change it\" he said. Lamberts said May\\'s eurosceptic rivals would have to decide whether they were prepared to accept cosmetic changes to the divorce paperwork to avoid a \"no deal\" Brexit and a border in Ireland. \"Of course the UK does not want to build border posts the EU will have to do it but it won\\'t be the fault of Europe\" he said. \"There\\'s no question of calling into question the integrity of the single market to resolve problems inside the British Conservative Party.\" \\'Throw of the dice\\' London stocks rallied and the pound rebounded slightly after suffering heavy losses on fears of Britain leaving the EU without a deal. Carolyn Fairbairn who heads the Confederation of British Industry lobby group said: \"Renegotiation is a throw of the dice. It must succeed or fail fast.\" Tuesday night\\'s parliamentary amendment called for the backstop to be replaced with \"alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border\" - vague wording that did not pin May to any approach. Also Tuesday MPs backed a non-binding measure that \"rejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement\". But they threw out another plan seeking to oblige May to request a delay to Brexit if no new deal with the EU emerges by February 26. \"I agree that we should not leave without a deal. However simply opposing no-deal is not enough to stop it\" May told MPs. Corbyn meeting She said parliament\\'s approval of the backstop amendment gave her the \"mandate\" to \"seek to obtain legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement\". May promised to give MPs a chance to vote on February 14 on what happens should she fail to win a new agreement. The prime minister was due to talk to Tusk and Varadkar on Wednesday and meet opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to discuss the way ahead. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Europe mounted an emergency summit Wednesday to decide how long a Brexit delay to grant British Prime Minister Theresa May - and under what conditions. Without a postponement Britain is due to crash out of the European Union at midnight on Friday under a \"no-deal\" Brexit that could trigger economic chaos. \\xa0 May wants to postpone Brexit from April 12 to June 30 to arrange an orderly departure - but the European leaders gathered in Brussels for a summit are expected to offer her a longer delay of up to a year. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told the parliament in Berlin before setting out for Brussels that the leaders might back a delay \"longer than the British prime minister has requested.\" \"I am of the opinion the German government is of the opinion that we should give both parties a reasonable amount of time\" she said. EU Council president Donald Tusk hosting the summit said the evidence of recent months gave EU leaders \"little reason to believe\" that British lawmakers will ratify the Brexit withdrawal treaty before May\\'s preferred June 30 date. \"In reality granting such an extension would increase the risk of a rolling series of short extensions and emergency summits creating new cliff-edge dates\" he said reflecting concern in EU capitals. \"One possibility would be a flexible extension which would last only as long as necessary and no longer than one year\" he said. According to a draft copy of the summit conclusions that EU leaders were to negotiate later in the day they were to agree to an extension to allow May time to ratify the withdrawal agreement. EU elections in doubt  \"Such an extension should last only as long as necessary and in any event no longer than [XX.XX.XXXX]\" the draft reads. The other 27 EU leaders will thrash out what date to fill in the blanks on Wednesday. \"If the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified by both parties before this date the withdrawal will take place on the first day of the following month\" the draft seen by AFP says. If Britain is still in the European Union when EU parliamentary elections begin on May 23 it must take part in the vote. \"If the United Kingdom fails to live up to this obligation the withdrawal will take place on 1 June 2019\" the draft warns. If an extension is agreed Brussels will portray it as a concession to Britain with some members - particularly France - not keen to see the disruptive Brexit drama drag on much longer. May insists she still wants to quickly ratify the withdrawal she agreed with EU leaders last November but which has been rejected by British lawmakers and to leave before the EU polls. \\xa0 In Paris an aide to President Emmanuel Macron said France was open to solutions.\\xa0 \"We\\'ve never been closed to the idea of finding an alternative solution to \\'no deal\\' within certain limits and not at any price\" the Elysee source said. Semi-detached Britain But while Merkel said he agreed that the delay should be \"as short as possible\" she added it \"should be long enough to create a certain calm so we don\\'t have to meet every two weeks to deal with the same subject.\" And Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said: \"The Netherlands is open to a longer delay.\" The French source said a 12-month extension \"seems too long\" and other Brussels diplomats told reporters that - after May makes her presentation - the other 27 leaders would debate to find a consensus position. EU members want to ensure that a semi-detached Britain does not seek leverage in Brexit talks by intervening in choosing the next head of the European Commission or the next multi-year EU budget. Britain was originally due to leave the EU on March 29. But Brussels agreed an extension after the British parliament rejected the withdrawal agreement negotiated with May.

Read the original article. The 2016 EU referendum resulted in a marginal victory for Brexit and a divided nation. After two years of negotiations politicians and voters seem further divided. The final decision may now be put back in the hands of voters in another referendum. So how could such a referendum produce an outcome to settle the debate? Or at least could we design a referendum that will not be perceived as an effort to overturn the 2016 decision? The answer is not easy and different designs lead to different outcomes. As we however argue while certain designs favour consensus others may lead to further divisions. Consider the three available options on a scale running from anti to pro-EU. The two options of remaining in the EU or exiting without a deal lie at the two extremes of the scale. Leaving the EU with the negotiated deal lies somewhere between. This would make a two-option referendum controversial so a three-option vote might be preferable. However that raises the question of how you get a meaningful mandate. We argue that a “Borda count” (named after the 18th-century mathematician Jean-Charles de Borda) should be used in this three-way referendum. On polling day voters rank the three options marking their favourite with a “1” their second favourite with a “2” and their worst option with a “3”. For each ballot the rule assigns 2 points to each voter’s first option 1 to their second and 0 to their third. The option with most points wins. With a Borda count if an option is supported by a majority the rule delivers it (as any other reasonable rule would do). If no single option is supported by a majority the Borda count in the particular setting works well. As we will argue it would most likely deliver the option that would have also won in a two-way referendum against either alternative. This would guarantee a certain degree of consensus. In the case of Brexit we think you can divide voters into four groups: 1) “No-deal supporters” want to leave the EU without a deal. If not possible they would rather leave the EU with a deal rather than remain. 2) “Remain supporters” want to remain. If not possible they would rather leave the EU with a deal than crash out of it. 3) “Deal/no-deal supporters” want to leave the EU with a deal. Their second preference is to leave the EU without a deal and their worst option is to remain. 4) “Deal/remain supporters” also want to leave with a deal but they would rather remain in the EU than crash out of it. Consider that none of the options is ranked first by at least 50% of voters. A Borda count in a three-way Brexit vote would most likely deliver the “deal” option. While this might sound like a terrible result to some in the absence of a clear majority it’s actually the least divisive option. That’s because in the absence of at least 50% of “no-deal” or “remain” supporters accepting the deal would also win against both other options in two-option referenda. Consider a “deal” versus “no deal” referendum: “deal” and “remain supporters” vote for the deal “no-deal supporters” oppose it. Since “no-deal” supporters are not a majority “remainers” and “deal supporters” give the victory to the “deal”. Similarly in a “remain” versus “deal” referendum “no deal” and “deal” supporters give the victory to the “deal”. The desirable feature of the Borda count is precisely this: it delivers the consensual “deal” option in a divisive scenario where no option is supported by a clear majority. Of course it would also deliver a victory for any of the three options if one were supported by a clear majority. Hence while it gives both “extreme” options (“remain” and “no deal”) fair chances it delivers a “moderate” soft Brexit in the absence of a clear majority. The above features make the Borda count a credible design that treats all options equally. It’s a design that parliamentarians could get behind as momentum builds towards holding a referendum. And should such a referendum happen this neutral design could help deliver a result voters can trust. We think that any other system would fail to produce a result that can truly resolve this question. A first-past-the-post three-option referendum would obviously fail to promote consensual options. It could give the victory to one of the extreme outcomes with 34% of the total vote – with the other two options tying at 33%. Others propose a two-question referendum in which question one repeats the original EU referendum question and question two asks voters to choose a preferred type of Brexit. This has similar properties to the Borda count. However if you repeat the original referendum question on the new ballot you invite criticism that you are simply rerunning the 2016 vote which risks perpetuating Brexit divisions. The Borda count is more neutral: it treats all options equally. In this context there are also problems with using a transferable vote system as supported by Conservative MP Justine Greening. As with the Borda count voters return a simple ranking. If there is no alternative ranked first by a majority the option that got the least first preferences is eliminated. These votes are then allocated to the two other options following the second ranked option. In the polarised scenario at hand if there is no majority for one of the “remain” or “no-deal” options to guarantee those options a straight win the “deal” option would most probably have the least first preferences. Hence the transferable vote would eliminate the moderate option first and one of the extreme options would win. This is in our view an undesirable feature of this system since as we previously established the moderate option would most likely win against both other options in a two-way referendum. That’s why we think the three-way Borda count vote is the best option for finding a way out of this Brexit mess.

No one was hurt in the incident but it was an unwelcome reminder of the 30 years of violence during the Troubles and reinforced the fact that peace is fragile. At the same time as this attack was taking place the British government was reported to be considering whether to “amend” the Good Friday Agreement in an attempt to solve the Brexit deadlock. By amending the agreement to guarantee an open border the government could avoid having to commit to a backstop in the Brexit bill – and get the bill through parliament. In the face of massive backlash the government denied the claims that it wants to change the Good Friday Agreement though this is not the first time that its commitment to this agreement has been questioned in the Brexit process. Whether the Good Friday Agreement needs amending is not a question that ought to be driven by the British government’s Brexit strategy. Our research shows that this is a question that should be driven from the bottom up by the needs and concerns of the population in Northern Ireland. Peace agreements are always the result of long and difficult bargaining processes and the process leading up to the Good Friday Agreement was no exception. They are always compromise documents signed by representatives of the warring parties – leaders of governments and opposition groups. The provisions necessary for the warring parties to lay their weapons are not necessarily popular among the population in whose name the agreement is signed. Yet peace agreements need local support to work. As part of an Attitudes for Peace research project we conducted a public opinion survey in Northern Ireland around the time of the Brexit referendum (between May and July 2016). The survey provides a unique window into people’s attitudes towards the Good Friday Agreement at that crucial time. It shows that despite the agreement’s shortcomings it generally has widespread support. Importantly the survey also shows that people of Northern Ireland continue to be concerned about a return to the violence of the past and that society continues to be divided along communal lines. The British government using the Good Friday Agreement in the Brexit process is unlikely to soften those divides. Among the 800 survey respondents 89% felt that the peace agreement was necessary to end the conflict and 84% felt it reflected the will of the people of Northern Ireland. Asked whether they were satisfied with the peace process 74% agreed. Though about half of the respondents expressed some concern that the agreement had not been implemented properly – which is likely to have grown in the last two years given the absence of a functioning power sharing government – the survey showed generally positive attitudes to the agreement in both communities. For example among both Catholics and Protestants there is strong support for power sharing and the agreement’s aim to eliminate differences in employment rates between the two communities. Reflecting the major fault lines of the conflict the survey shows that one of the divisive issues in the agreement – although overall strongly supported – is the provision stating that Northern Ireland should remain part of the UK if the majority of the population so wishes. The architects of the Good Friday Agreement never sought to resolve the political differences that led to the conflict directly. Instead the hope was that a return to peaceful politics and political discourse would in time lead to coexistence and reconciliation. The concern today is that Brexit is emphasising the divisive issues of the Troubles. Brexit negotiations and the idea that the peace agreement is “up for grabs” has the potential to deepen divides. The most obvious divides remain physical. The Catholic and Protestant communities are highly segregated especially in poorer and urban areas. Nothing has come to represent communal divisions more than the interfaces and so-called peace walls several of which were built since 1998. The walls are supposed to come down by 2023 but the survey shows that the share of the population that still finds them necessary (38%) is just as big as the share supporting their dismantlement (40%). This demonstrates people’s insecurity and fear of a return to violence. The survey shows that people were particularly supportive of the security brought by disarmament – in both communities. Indeed the vast majority wants to move on from the conflict. The survey also highlights people’s fear of renewed violence. A large minority saw political violence (41%) and the risk of new armed conflict (36%) as a big problem. The majority of respondents do not support violence as a political means though the survey does show support for violence under certain circumstances. When probed some respondents said that political violence is justified to defend oneself “if the government turns repressive or violent” (29%) “if the security forces become too powerful” (22%) and “if the state treats some groups more favourably than others” (15%). The Good Friday Agreement is a pillar for the peace in Northern Ireland. It has been hailed as a model for peace agreements which in many ways is reflected in the overall high levels of support it enjoys. Yet peace is still fragile in Northern Ireland threatened both by communal divides and persistent violence. Whether or not these problems can be solved by amending the Good Friday Agreement is debatable. However any discussions on the issue should be motivated by efforts towards greater reconciliation the normalisation of relations between the two communities and reducing violence not power politics in London Dublin or Brussels.

The United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29 yet little is clear: There is so far no full exit deal rivals to Prime Minister Theresa May are circling and some lawmakers are pushing for a rerun of the 2016 referendum. Michel Barnier the EU\\'s chief negotiator said on Monday that a Brexit deal was possible \"within six or eight weeks\" if negotiators were realistic in their demands. Brexit supporters in May\\'s Conservative Party who want a more distant relationship with the EU last week circulated a 140-page draft alternative Brexit plan. But Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg head of the pro-Brexit European Research Group which led the work on the alternative plan said the full document would not be published. \"The truth is that we reconsidered\" he added. An influential Brexiteer in May\\'s party Steve Baker said on Monday that 80 or more of her lawmakers are prepared to vote against her Brexit plan. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Sterling slid to a three-year low against the euro on Monday after Prime Minister Theresa May set a March deadline for the formal departure process from the European Union to begin sending British shares to a 16-month high. May told her Conservative Party\\'s annual conference on Sunday that she was determined to move on with the process and win the \"right deal\" in a move to ease fears inside the party that she may delay the divorce. May said she will invoke Article 50 no later than the end of March next year referring to the EU\\'s Lisbon Treaty that formally puts the divorce proceedings between the EU and Britain in place. This means she kicks off the negotiations process before the French and German elections next year and implies the two-year Brexit clock triggered under Article 50 will wind down by March 2019 a year before Britain\\'s next general election. While the March deadline offers some clarity to the process and underpinned stocks many in the market worry that the government\\'s stance points to a so-called \"hard Brexit\" that would see the UK left outside the single market in favour of strict controls on migration. Though the economy has shown resilience post-referendum fears of a slowdown in business investment and the wider economy will undermine the pound and the focus turns to possible further easing by the Bank of England in the coming months. Sterling fell 1 percent to $1.2845 its weakest since early July and not far from the 31-year low of $1.2798 struck on July 6 just days after the June 23 referendum on EU membership. It hit a three-year low against the euro . \"For market participants the key soundbite was that regaining control over EU immigration into the UK would be the priority ahead of membership of the single market\" said Shilen Shah bond strategist at Investec Wealth and Investment. \"Sterling has the potential to come under further pressure given the probable stalling of foreign direct investments.\" Investors worry a \"hard exit\" from Europe\\'s single market or what the Royal Bank of Canada dubbed as \"Smexit\" -- or single-market exit -- will drag Britain into a recession and blow out its ballooning current account deficit already among the highest in the developed world. A wider current account gap and slowing foreign investments tends to be a drag on the currency. \"May\\'s stance is a reminder that uncertainties related to \"Smexit\" turbulence could be costly for the economy in the short run\" said Sam Hill RBC Capital Markets senior economist. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The European Union will be taking a \"fair and pragmatic\" approach on the Brexit issue European Union Affairs Minister Louis Grech said this afternoon. He was speaking at the end of a General Affairs Council informal meeting held at the Grandmaster\\'s Palace in Valletta. His remarks were made hours after the UK Supreme Court upheld an earlier ruling which said that the British Government could not trigger Article 50 of the EU Treaty \\xa0to end its membership without the approval of the House of Commons. Addressing a joint news conference with European Commission first vice-President Frans Timmermans Mr Grech noted that the forthcoming informal EU summit to be held in Valletta on February 3 would be an important step to discuss the way forward on the future sustainability of the the bloc. Asked if the Maltese presidency would be taking a harsh approach Mr Grech said the way forward was to be \"fair and pragmatic\".\\xa0 Commenting on the outcome of the informal meeting Mr Grech said that the two over-arching objectives of both the Maltese Presidency and the Commission were the \"viability and sustainability\" of the European project and the restoration of people\\'s trust in the EU. On his part Mr Timmermans pointed out that it was the UK which would be requesting to leave the EU. \"We can only start talks once Article 50 is triggered. This is in their hands. The Supreme Court ruling implications are purely for the UK government to clarify\" he said. He remarked that Brussels would seek to get the best possible deal for the remaining 27 states while trying to minimise the harm on both sides as much as possible. Apart from Brexit the informal ministerial meeting led by Mr Grech on behalf of the Maltese Presidency also touched on the issue of migration which is one of the Maltese priorities. Mr Grech said that doing nothing was not an option but he acknowledged that there were diverging views on the after within the bloc. He said Malta\\'s aim would be to find a shared solution to the problem to end this human tragedy. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The option is an extreme scenario under consideration by some Wall Street firms if the terms of an exit currently a matter of speculation leave financial services companies in Britain unable under their current set-ups to do business inside the EU according to discussions Reuters had with several US banks and their lawyers. The scenarios being studied by task forces at US banks underscore the extent to which the London operations of non-European banks are linked to business on the continent. In particular focus are the banks’ market operations as trading of most European securities is regulated at the EU level but conducted by many investment banks mainly out of London. The five largest US banks employ 40000 people in London more than in the rest of Europe combined taking advantage of the EU “passporting” regime that allows them to offer services across the bloc out of their British hubs. Having to reorganise business in order to set up new continental European outposts – which US banks say is a worst-case scenario that they are being forced to consider – would be so costly that it would make some rethink their commitment to the bloc altogether. “The costs may lead some banking groups to reassess how important Europe is in the context of their global business and what sort of presence they wish to maintain post-Brexit” said Edward Chan a partner at the law firm Linklaters which has been advising banks on contingency arrangements. If Britain were to remain a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) which gives Norway Iceland and Liechtenstein access to the EU’s single market its financial companies would retain passporting rights for EU countries although Britain would have no say in the formulation of EU rules. But if Britain quit the EEA UK-based firms wanting to operate in the EU would face an “equivalence” test to prove to Brussels that their home rules are as strict as those in the EU. Leading Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson has said Britain could create a “Britzerland” based on Switzerland’s bilateral treaties with Brussels. However Swiss financial institutions do not enjoy passporting rights within the EU and Swiss investment banks like their American peers base most of their EU operations in London. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

European shares fell to their lowest level in more than two months today hit by a sell-off in cyclical stocks and widespread unease in markets over a possible British exit from the European Union. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 1.4 percent at 1289.95 points by 1137 GMT after hitting its lowest since early April and extending the previous session\\'s 2.3 percent drop. The STOXX Europe 600 was trading 1.5 percent lower after setting its lowest in more than two months. European shares came under further selling pressure following a risk-off pattern in global markets as investors positioned for central bank meetings this week and a referendum on Britain\\'s EU membership set for June 23. One poll out after the market closed on Friday gave the \"out\" campaign a 10 point lead though two subsequent polls over the weekend painted a mixed picture over which side will win. Bookmakers still believe that the referendum is likely to result in a vote to remain in the EU although the probability of an \"in\" vote has dropped 10 percentage points from last week. Before then the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of England Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Japan are all expected to hold monetary policy steady against a backdrop of caution heightened by the Brexit issue. \"We\\'re in uncharted territory in front of the Brexit vote and then there\\'s also the Fed this week. So the wall of worry is quite high at the moment. All the banks are a little bit lower and they\\'re the ones which are likely to get hit\" said Zeg Choudhry managing director at LONTRAD. \"For the next two weeks you\\'ve got to be slightly mad if you\\'ve not got your money in defensive stocks.\" Cyclical stocks - sensitive to economic shifts - were the top fallers with the auto and bank sectors down 2.0 and 1.6 percent respectively. Commodity stocks also came under pressure with miners down 1.6 percent and oil and gas shares down 1.3 percent. Brent crude prices dipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in a week hit by a darkening economic outlook.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said he was worried about the future of the Premier League and the damage it could suffer as Britain prepared to face the consequences of leaving the European Union (EU). \"The way in which England will leave the European Union will dictate the future of the Premier League\" Wenger told British media. \"If the league becomes less attractive the broadcasters will offer less money for the rights club revenues will decrease and the Premier League will suffer the consequences. There lies the problem.\" Last month\\'s vote by Britons to leave the EU has left the world\\'s fifth-biggest economy facing deep uncertainty about its growth prospects and its attractiveness to investors. Despite the Premier League\\'s 5.14-billion-pound ($6.72-billion) domestic television rights deal set to kick in from August Wenger feared that broadcasters would offer less money in the longer term as a result of Brexit. \"We thought that one day the best players from Real and Barca would say: \\'I also want to go to England because everyone is over there.\\' All of that is now uncertain and Brexit is a spanner in the works... not in the very short term but in the long term yes\" Wenger said. \"The players will see their wages come down a bit and the competition with Germany for example will be stronger\" added the Frenchman who has an economics degree. \"But that was one of the risks of the job and that worries me less. England still has a good amount of financial resources. There is a margin in terms of the money that will come in again this year.\" Wenger believes the English clubs\\' spending during the close season will be affected after the pound fell to its lowest level in more than 30 years following the vote. He dismissed a suggestion that footballers should be given exemption from any freedom of movement restrictions within Europe if they were introduced. \"A lot of jobs are international. Why should we prioritise football? When a rule exists it should apply to all professions otherwise there will always be demands that are made\" the 66-year-old Wenger said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

European summits are held behind closed doors and in another world much of the information filtering out would be disseminated informally by aides. But in the age of Twitter and Facebook a new breed of European leader has made it a point to communicate their thoughts to the world via brief messages. Monitoring Twitter is almost a mandatory job at EU summits where the age of the twitterati means that political positions and pointed comments are disseminated publicly by the leaders themselves.  And yesterday’s EU summit the first after the British vote to leave the EU was no exception. Our very own Prime Minister is one of the more renowned twitterati at EU summits sometimes going so far as to tweet the dinner menu. Joseph Muscat was one of the first off the blocks at 11.30am noting the disconnect between the Brussels apparatchiks and ordinary citizens when emphasis was being placed on Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty – which outlines the exit terms for member states. “Talk of Art50 irrelevant for vast majority of Europeans. Fact that EU talking only about this rather than real issues says it all” Dr Muscat tweeted a message he later reiterated in front of the cameras before entering the summit.  Opposition leader Simon Busuttil in Brussels for the European People’s Party summit also hit the Twitter deck calling for “calm clear-thinking not knee-jerk reactions” in response to Brexit. But in a bout of domestic political bickering he also lambasted the Prime Minister: “Why is Joseph Muscat all over Twitter passing snide eurosceptic remarks when he just said it would be suicidal to leave?” The tweet elicited an immediate tweetsponse from the Prime Minister’s spokesman Kurt Farrugia. He called on Dr Busuttil to “get up to speed” on people’s realities: “EU for people not for legalisms. He [Dr Busuttil] simply does not get it.” EU for people not for legalisms. He simply does not get it The petty bickering aside Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite another prominent member of the European leaders’ twitterati club laid out her views prior to the summit. In a short message Dr Grybauskaite tweeted: “Keep calm & face the #Brexit challenge.” The tweet reflected the call she made later in front of television cameras for unity among the remaining 27 member states. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

GlaxoSmithKline plans £275 million of new investments at three drug manufacturing sites in Britain signalling its confidence in the country despite last month’s vote to leave the EU. Britain’s biggest drugmaker which had argued against Brexit before the referendum believes the UK remains an attractive place for making medicines thanks to a skilled workforce and relatively low tax rates. The country’s so-called patent box boosts profits from patented innovations by halving the rate of corporation tax. This tax relief which favours pharmaceutical companies has come under fire in recent days from the opposition Labour Party. GSK said yesterday it was investing in sites at Barnard Castle in the north of England Montrose in Scotland and Ware north of London. It plans to increase production of next-generation respiratory drugs and biotech medicines. The vast majority of these products will be exported. “It is testament to our skilled UK workforce and the country’s leading position in life sciences that we are making these investments in advanced manufacturing here” said chief executive Andrew Witty. Business minister Greg Clark said GSK’s move was a clear vote of confidence in Britain and demonstrated that “there really is no place better in Europe to grow a business”. The company has a large part of its global research and manufacturing cost base in Britain even though nearly all its sales are generated overseas. Witty who is retiring next year had said before the vote that Britain should remain in the EU due to fears that Brexit could disrupt Europe’s unified system for drug regulation and hamper access to top scientific talent. Despite this the company which will be helped by recent falls in sterling has concluded that the country remains a good place to do business. Britain accounts for nearly half of GSK’s worldwide research and development and around a third of its manufacturing. It has a total of nine UK manufacturing sites employing some 6000 staff. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Signs that Britain’s economy is slowing as it prepares to leave the European Union hardened yesterday as official data showed a surprise drop in industrial output and construction in February and a mixed performance for trade. Sterling slid to a one-week low against the dollar after industrial output dipped 0.7 per cent in February worse than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists which had pointed to a 0.2 per cent increase. Output fell 0.3 per cent in January. A surprisingly large goods trade deficit – albeit distorted by imports of high-value goods like gold and aircraft – and a slump in construction added to evidence that Britain’s economic growth rate peaked towards the end of last year. Britain’s National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated that yesterday’s data suggested growth in the first three months of 2017 would slow to 0.5 per cent from a robust 0.7 per cent in the last three months of 2016. There are already signs that rising inflation caused in part by the pound’s post-Brexit vote tumble is crimping spending by consumers the main drivers of the economy just as Prime Minister Theresa May begins Britain’s EU divorce talks. Underlining the caution among households mortgage lender Halifax reported the weakest house price growth in nearly four years and a survey of recruiters showed staff were nervous about switching jobs ahead of Brexit. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney speaking at Thomson Reuters’ London office yesterday said he would keep a close eye on whether consumer demand weakens in line with the central bank’s expectations. “Today’s deluge of UK economic data was fairly disappointing and adds to the evidence that the economy has lost some momentum during Q1” said Ruth Gregory economist at Capital Economics. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggested manufacturing was not making up for a consumer spending slowdown as some econo- mists had hoped following the pound’s drop. Output in manufacturing a component of industrial output which accounts for about 10 per cent of Britain’s gross domestic product unexpectedly fell 0.1 per cent following a one per cent fall in January disappointing against forecasts for a 0.3 per cent rise in the Reuters poll. British manufacturing had a mixed performance in 2016 with economic growth driven mostly by the much larger services sector and consumer spending. A closely-watched business survey on Monday showed British manufacturing lost some of its momentum in March as export orders grew more slowly and demand for consumer goods faltered against a backdrop of rising inflation pressures. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  London remains the globe\\'s most attractive financial centre extending its lead over New York despite Britain\\'s looming departure from the European Union a survey found today. Britain\\'s departure from the trading bloc has led to some politicians and economists predicting London will lose its pre-eminent status as a financial centre but there are few signs of that happening yet. London was placed first followed by New York Hong Kong and Singapore in the Z/Yen global financial centres index (GFCI) which ranks 92 financial centres on factors such as infrastructure and access to high quality staff. New York was 24 points behind the British capital the biggest gap between the two since the survey started in 2007. New York\\'s ranking fell 24 points from last year the largest fall among the top contenders a dip the survey\\'s authors said was \"presumably due to fears over US trade\" New York\\'s ranking fell 24 points from last year the largest fall among the top contenders a dip the survey\\'s authors said was \"presumably due to fears over US trade\". Since becoming US President in January Donald Trump has pulled out of a planned trans-Pacific trade agreement and is pursuing a more isolationist economic policy. Britain\\'s most powerful financial lobby group TheCityUK cautioned against complacency and called for clarity on its transitional arrangements for leaving the EU which will apply beyond April 2019 when Britain is due to formally leave. \"Absent this many firms have already started to activate their contingency plans and others will undoubtedly follow suit if these aren\\'t confirmed as soon as possible - and by the end of this year at the very latest\" said Miles Celic chief executive officer of TheCityUK. Since the survey was conducted in June talks between Britain\\'s Brexit minister David Davis and his opposite number at the European Commission Michel Barnier have become increasingly acrimonious. The past two months have also seen a pick-up in the number of banks saying they plan to set up new EU subsidiaries after Brexit with most major U.S. British and Japanese banks saying they will establish units in Frankfurt or Dublin. Frankfurt has moved up to 11th in the table from 23rd a year ago and Dublin has moved to 30th from 33rd.

Major disruption to flights between Britain and the European Union from March 2019 is looking increasingly likely as Brexit talks proceed Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O\\'Leary warned today. Airlines say they would need a new deal to replace the current \"Open Skies\" arrangement by September or October next year to be able to provide scheduled flights in the months after Britain leaves the EU. But O\\'Leary said initial signs from Brexit talks were not promising and that likely EU demands for any new deal - including oversight by the European Court of Justice - would likely be unpalatable to London. \"It\\'s odds against a deal being done in advance of Christmas 2018 because it is in the Europeans\\' interest to not have a deal done... and all hell will be kicking off over here in the UK\" O\\'Leary told journalists at a briefing in London. O\\'Leary was speaking after talks with British Transport Secretary Chris Grayling which he described as \"a very good meeting\". O\\'Leary said Grayling was increasingly conscious of the need to conclude an aviation deal before the end of 2018. However he said did not share Grayling\\'s optimism that a deal would be straightforward. \"We believe the French and the German airlines in particular are actively negotiating against any favourable deal\" O\\'Leary said. O\\'Leary has been warning since January that a failure by London and Brussels to agree a new bilateral aviation deal by late 2018 could lead to a total freeze on flights between Britain and the European Union. He said that without a deal on aviation Ryanair would move dozens of planes currently in Britain to bases in other EU countries to continue flying. Britain formally began negotiations to leave the European Union in June but little progress has been made towards an agreement on issues such as citizens\\' rights which are first on the agenda before sectoral issues like aviation are discussed. O\\'Leary an outspoken critic of the British decision to leave the European Union has warned of the uncertainties caused by the vote ever since the referendum in June 2016 and said that a deal looked no more likely now than it did then. \"We\\'re 12 months down the road and we\\'re no closer to an agreement\" O\\'Leary said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Lloyds Banking Group aims to get its Berlin branch ready for business in Europe by the end of the year ahead of Britain leaving the European Union according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Lloyds this month filed an application with Germany’s financial regulators to convert its local branch into a subsidiary the person said which will enable it to keep its continental operations within the EU unaffected by Brexit. The move is more than a formality and will require Lloyds to inject capital into the business to underpin its activities. The amount will depend on the ultimate size of the Berlin business but is expected to be in the low hundreds of millions of pounds the person said representing less than one per cent of the bank’s overall capital. Banks are taking steps to ensure their European operations can continue to sell across Europe should Britain leave the EU without a trade deal. IG Group Holdings a British online financial trading company said yesterday it plans to create a subsidiary in Dusseldorf. While banks are acting now large-scale staff moves will likely come only later. In Lloyds’ case the Berlin outpost is set to remain small. It currently employs about 300 staff and that is expected to rise by just a handful. Reuters reported last February that Lloyds Britain’s largest mortgage lender was examining steps to turn its branch in the German capital into a subsidiary. It is the only major British retail lender without a subsidiary in another EU country. Frankfurt has been the preferred base for US banks preparing for EU trading after Brexit with Morgan Stanley Citi and JPMorgan so far choosing the city which hosts the European Central Bank. For Lloyds Berlin’s appeal is that it already has the bank’s main European branch with a full management team in place including the finance risk and human resources staff. The bank is still expecting to transfer only a handful of jobs to the new subsidiary the person said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

And his latest scathing criticism of Prime Minister Theresa May is fueling speculation he will eventually mount a leadership challenge.\\xa0 Johnson writing in the Daily Telegraph compared the negotiating plan that led to his resignation as May\\'s foreign minister to entering battle under a \"white flag\" of surrender to the EU. Reuters political correspondent Will James said the stakes were especially high for the prime minister at the moment because Brexit is so close. \"It\\'s less than seven months away now and that means that everything that is undecided that\\'s putting pressure upon her position has to be decided within a very short space of time. The question is what are the terms of that departure and of course will she still be in charge when we do.\" Johnson\\'s regular columns have kept him in the public eye. This one was timed to coincide with parliament\\'s return from summer recess this week. Downing Street issued a rebuttal claiming the strategy the party adopted was the only credible one out there. The public acknowledgment of Johnson\\'s attack may be evidence of how legitimate a threat he and other party rebels are. The European Union isn\\'t happy with Prime Minister May either.\\xa0 \"If you\\'re on the European Commission\\'s side what they see is Britain trying to cherrypick access to the single market -- the best bits of the single market. That\\'s something that if they let Britain do that who else is going to ask next? So for Theresa May she\\'s really plotted a path inbetween those two factions and is now feeling the force of their anger on both sides\" James said.\\xa0 But for Brussels May\\'s departure could be disastrous. Johnson\\'s on record as suggesting the UK should negotiate more like Donald Trump. And Trump he said would \"go in bloody hard.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  British firms are keeping a lid on pay and automating more production while some shoppers faced with rising prices are switching to cheaper products the Bank of England said yesterday. The findings came in a report from around the country that showed Brexit is hurting households mainly through the weaker pound. Businesses serving British consumers are suffering compared with export-focused manufacturers as the weaker exchange rate and higher inflation following last year’s vote to leave the European Union feeds through the economy. Last week BoE governor Mark Carney said Britain’s economy was suffering from uncertainty and higher prices caused by the referendum decision in June 2016 and the central bank cut its forecasts for future growth and wages. Wednesday’s report by the BoE’s regional staff – which fed into last week’s forecasts – showed businesses planned to offer pay awards of between two and three per cent despite growing recruitment difficulties. Business investment remained modest with unspecified “uncertainty” weighing on longer-term plans “Overall employment intentions remained modest” the BoE said. “Growth in manufacturing (employment) intentions was stable and was dampened by a stronger focus on productivity improvements and automation over job creation” it added. The BoE forecast last week that economic growth would slow to 1.7 per cent this year and 1.6 per cent in 2018 while wages are seen rising by two per cent and then three per cent. After unexpectedly outperforming other big advanced economies last year in 2017 Britain had its slowest first half of the year since 2012. Firms reported prices for goods and services rose at the fastest pace in four years in line with official measures of inflation and consumer spending growth slowed. “Some contacts ascribed this to increased caution among consumers and to consumers trading down to cheaper products or brands” the BoE said. Sales at consumer services businesses grew at their slowest pace in over four years while manufacturing exports saw their fastest expansion since 2011. Business investment – which the BoE hopes will offset some of the damage to consumer spending - remained modest with unspecified “uncertainty” weighing on longer-term plans. The agents’ report on contacts with businesses in June and the first half of July which includes the period when Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly failed to win a parliamentary majority as well as the start of Brexit talks in Brussels. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

In its outlook for the UK economy the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is projecting GDP growth for 2018 at 1.5 per cent down from 1.6 per cent in 2017 citing Brexit uncertainty as the main dampener on growth. The IMF welcomed recent progress in Brexit talks but added that there was a very long list of tasks ahead with a very ambitious time frame including reaching a trade deal with the EU negotiating new arrangements with some 60 countries boosting human and IT resources in customs and other areas and transposing thousands of pages of EU law into UK domestic statute. In the meantime German business confidence weakened in December survey results from Ifo institute show. The business sentiment index fell to 117.2 in December. Economists had forecast the indicator to rise to 117.6 from November’s original estimate of 117.5. The decline in business sentiment from a record high suggests that the outlook for next year is still positive despite the uncertain political backdrop and the prospect of the European Central Bank reducing its monetary easing programme. But with EU wage growth still very subdued the central bank is in no hurry to raise interest rates. Finally in the US the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) confidence index showed an unexpected jump in homebuilders’ confidence in December on expectations of a stronger economy. A monthly reading of homebuilder sentiment rose five points to 74. This is the highest reading since 1999. A reading above 50 indicates positive sentiment. In the meantime November’s reading was revised down by one point. Economists had expected the index to come in unchanged compared to the 70 originally reported for the previous month. NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz stated that “with low unemployment rates favourable demographics and a tight supply of existing home inventory we can expect continued upward movement of the single-family construction sector next year”. This report was compiled by Bank of Valletta for general information purposes only. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A billionaire behind a pro-Brexit think tank who has obtained a Maltese passport has been accused in the House of Commons of being a suspected Russian agent with links to money-laundering. Christopher Chandler was said to be an “object of interest” to the French who suspected him of “working for the Russian intelligence services” The Times of London reported. The accusation was made using parliamentary privilege by Bob Seely a Conservative MP and member of the foreign affairs select committee. Mr Seely cited security files that he said were authenticated by French UK and US sources. Mr Seely\\xa0called for an investigation.\\xa0 Another MP Liam\\xa0Byrne (Labour) said there was a need for an investigation into money-laundering claims and the sale of passport in Malta.\\xa0 Mr Chandler a New Zealand-born tycoon provides financial support to the Legatum Institute a London-based think tank with strong links to cabinet ministers MPs economists and campaigners who support a hard Brexit.\\xa0 The Financial Times had reported in January that Mr Chandler had obtained a Maltese passport.\\xa0 In March Times of Malta reported how Mr\\xa0Chandler had a\\xa0Pilatus\\xa0Bank account but was distancing himself from the bank insisting he only\\xa0used it to buy his Maltese passport.\\xa0\\xa0 Following news reports on possible money-laundering activities at the Ta’ Xbiex bank a spokesman for Mr Chandler had insisted that his only association with Pilatus was to acquire a Maltese passport. The Guardian quoted Mr\\xa0Seely saying that he and four other MPs had seen documents from Monaco’s security department. These “brief terse factual files” related to “national security and money laundering” and included information supplied by the DST intelligence agency France’s equivalent of MI5. The MP said senior French intelligence sources plus their British and American counterparts had “authenticated” their content. He added: “The documents indicated a link – a noted individual in this country – with Russian intelligence.” The files dated from 2005 and covered a period from the mid-1990s he said. They concerned “Christopher Chandler and his brother” the MP said adding that he was convinced the files were genuine.\\xa0 The Legatum\\xa0denied the MP’s allegations insisting Mr Chandler “has never been associated directly or indirectly with Russian intelligence or the Russian state”. It added: “Neither Christopher Chandler nor anyone at Legatum is aware of any such alleged “investigation” by the French authorities not 16 years ago or at any time since. “To be clear Christopher Chandler has never been approached at any time by the French or any other authorities regarding Russia and maintains a sterling record of ethical business practices earned over many decades.”\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The German economy Europe\\'s largest is expected to post its weakest growth rate in many years in 2018 as exporters are facing headwinds from abroad. But vibrant domestic demand means many companies are still able to expand business. In a survey conducted by Reuters the heads of Germany\\'s leading industry associations said they did not see the economy entering a recession and that most forecasts were predicting a solid growth rate of around 1.5 per cent for 2019. But the industry associations said the economic woes of company executives were increasing and the government should do more to help them for example by lowering corporate taxes and investing more in digital infrastructure. \"The biggest risk in the short term is Brexit\" said Dieter Kempf president of the BDI industry association. If Britain left the EU in March without any agreement on its future relations with the bloc this would create massive uncertainties for trade and business Kempf warned. \"The British economy would face the direct threat of a recession which would indirectly also affect Germany\" Kempf said. Holger Bingmann head of the BGA trade group said Brexit was the \"most urgent problem for the German economy\" while an escalation of international trade disputes sparked by the United States could potentially derail the economic upswing. DIHK President Eric Schweitzer said German companies are still worried about the US imposing higher import tariffs on European cars. \"The threat of car tariffs is still on the table\" Schweitzer warned. It was vital that both sides increased their efforts to find a solution to the trade dispute through negotiations that ideally would lead to lower tariffs Schweitzer said. The German economy likely grew by around 1.5 per cent this year compared with 2.2 per cent in 2017. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The central bank carried out the same measure ahead of and following Britain\\'s referendum on leaving the EU in June 2016. Britain is on course to leave the European Union on March 29 although there has been increasing talk of a possible delay. \"The Bank of England is today announcing a temporary amendment to its liquidity insurance facilities\" the BoE said Tuesday.\\xa0 \"The Bank will increase the frequency of existing market-wide sterling operations Indexed Long-Term Repos (ILTRs).\" In ILTR operations financial institutions can offer assets to the Bank of England in return for six-month cash loans.\\xa0 This helps banks and the wider financial industry keep ticking over during periods of market turbulence.\\xa0 Similar lending was also carried out in 2008 during the global financial crisis. Tuesday\\'s announcement comes a day after the Bank of England said that authorities in Britain and the United States had agreed to maintain how multi-trillion-dollar financial transactions are carried out between the two countries after Brexit. The agreement concerns trades of derivatives - securities whose value is based on an asset such as currencies stocks and commodities. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The UK economy has slumped at its fastest rate since the financial crisis in the wake of Britain\\'s vote to leave the European Union a report said. The closely-watched Markit Flash UK Composite Output Index plummeted to its lowest level since April 2009 falling to 47.7 in July compared to 52.4 in June. A reading above 50 indicates growth. The sharp contraction was triggered by falling output and orders for the first time since the end of 2012 while business optimism in Britain\\'s powerhouse services sector hit a seven-and-a-half-year low. The data collected between July 12 and 21 provides a stark picture of the state of the economy following the Brexit vote with City experts now warning that Britain could be heading for a recession. Sterling was down 0.2% against the dollar at 1.318 US dollars after the report was published while the pound also fell 0.3% against the euro at 1.195 euro. Chris Williamson chief economist at Markit said the update showed a \"dramatic deterioration\" in the UK economy and expects gross domestic product (GDP) to contract by 0.4% in the third quarter. \"The downturn whether manifesting itself in order book cancellations a lack of new orders or the postponement or halting of projects was most commonly attributed in one way or another to Brexit.\" He added: \"Given the record slump in service sector business expectations the suggestion is that there is further pain to come in the short term at least.\" The study found that its flash UK services PMI (purchasing managers\\' index) hit an 88-month low of 47.4 this month compared to 52.3 in June. The flash UK manufacturing PMI was also in the doldrums slipping to a 41-month low of 49.1 in July after a reading of 52.1 the month before. The flash UK manufacturing PMI output index also dropped from 52.9 to 49.1 over the period. The report said the downturn in the services sector was \"more marked\" than in manufacturing with services activity and new orders dropping at their quickest rate for seven years. But while output and new orders also came under pressure in the manufacturing sector its new export business rose for the second straight month boosted in part by the sharp drop in sterling following the Brexit vote. The update comes after the Bank of England said on Wednesday that business uncertainty had \\'\\'risen markedly\\'\\' since the referendum result - but there was \\'\\'no clear evidence\\'\\' of a sharp economic slowdown. However Neil Wilson markets analyst at ETX Capital said the flash PMI data showed that Britain should be bracing itself for another recession while the Bank of England should move to cut interest rates in August. \"The readings suggest we are heading for a recession again and it is almost certain the Bank of England will pull the trigger on aggressive stimulus to boost aggregate demand. He added: \"The Bank will throw the kitchen sink at this now.\" Samuel Tombs chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said: \"The collapse in the composite PMI to its lowest level since April 2009 provides the first major evidence that the UK is entering a sharp downturn.\" He added: \"The chart shows that the composite PMI has fallen to a level that has persuaded the (Bank\\'s) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to cut interest rates by about 50 basis points in the past.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

In an interview May appointed after Britain\\'s vote in June to leave the EU said she would not wait for an election in Germany next September before triggering Article 50 of the EU\\'s Lisbon Treaty to start formal divorce proceedings. The former interior minister has been under pressure from EU officials investors and members of her ruling Conservative Party to offer more detail on her plan for Britain\\'s exit beyond her catch phrase \"Brexit means Brexit\". Speaking on the first day of her party\\'s annual conference on Sunday May will hope to put some of the criticism to rest by pledging to overturn the 1972 European Communities Act the law allowed the accession of Britain to the European Economic Community which later became the European Union. \"We will introduce in the next Queen\\'s speech a Great Repeal Bill that will remove the European Communities Act from the statute book\" she told the newspaper which said it should take place in April or May. \"This marks the first stage in the UK becoming a sovereign and independent country once again. It will return power and authority to the elected institutions of our country. It means that the authority of EU law in Britain will end.\" May said that under her plans the 1972 act would be overturned in advance of Britain leaving the EU but the repeal would take legal effect the moment the UK formally pulled out. Then the European Court of Justice (ECJ) would no longer be able to deliver judgments binding on Britain she told the newspaper. The ECJ came under fire from many of those who campaigned to leave the European Union before the June referendum with the official \"Vote Leave\" group saying Britain lost most of its cases to the court which it called an \"injustice\". The British leader is expected to trigger Article 50 to start formal departure which can take up to two years to negotiate early next year but she has been clear she does not want to give her hand away before the talks. May who was appointed after her predecessor David Cameron resigned following the referendum also ruled out an early parliamentary election saying it would cause \"instability\" - something that has dampened investment since the referendum. Separately her Brexit minister David Davis said in a statement that EU law would be transposed into British law on the day Britain formally left the European Union. Laws that were then deemed unnecessary would be repealed by parliament subsequently. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Sterling slid to its lowest in more than three decades against the dollar today as investors sold the currency on worries over the impact of Britain's looming departure from the European Union. Sterling skidded more than 1 percent yesterday on the back of Prime Minister Theresa May's announcement on Sunday that the formal process that will take Britain out of the EU will start by the end of March. It extended those falls today slipping more than half a percent to $1.2764 its weakest since June 1985. It also hit a three-year low of 87.51 pence per euro down 0.2 percent on the day.

A group of 250 business leaders and entrepreneurs have signed up as backers of a pro-Brexit campaign ahead of the European Union referendum. The business figures including former HSBC chief executive Michael Geoghegan JD Wetherspoon pub boss Tim Martin hotelier Sir Rocco Forte and Luke Johnson - chairman of continental-style cafe chain Patisserie Valerie - have given their support to Vote Leave in a personal capacity. The campaign group also announced that former British Chambers of Commerce director general John Longworth who quit after indicating his support for Brexit at the business organisation\\'s annual conference earlier this month will take up a new role with Vote Leave. Mr Longworth who has been appointed chairman of Vote Leave\\'s business council said: \"This is the most important political debate of a generation. Business is divided on the issue and it is vital the full breadth of business opinion is heard. Many firms struggle with relentless interference from the EU and rules that are stacked in the favour of a select number of businesses. \"If we Vote Leave liberated from the shackles of EU membership jobs will be safer Britain will be able to spend our money on our priorities and we can look forward to faster growth and greater prosperity in the future.\" Vote Leave\\'s chief executive Matthew Elliott said: \\'We\\'re delighted that John Longworth has agreed to chair Vote Leave\\'s Business Council. His strong business track record and his courageous decision to share his true beliefs with voters makes him an extremely powerful voice in the EU debate.\" A survey of small and medium-sized firms commissioned by the group found that 32% said the EU hinders businesses like theirs while 25% said it helped them 40% said it made no difference. The YouGov study indicated that 14% of the firms believed that the EU makes it easier for their business to employ people while 31% said Brussels\\' rules made it harder for them to employ people 48% said EU rules made no difference. Mr Elliott said: \"With our growing list of business supporters Vote Leave will make that case that whilst the EU might be good for big multinationals for smaller businesses it acts as a job destruction regulatory machine. Brussels hinders smaller businesses particularly those firms who can\\'t afford to lobby Brussels to curry favour. Jobs wages and our economy will thrive when we take back control and vote Leave.\" Remain campaigners insisted that British business supported a vote to stay in the EU in the June 23 referendum. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Official figures given to this newspaper by Transport Malta confirm that in the aftermath of the June 23 referendum when Britons decided to leave the EU second-hand UK car imports to Malta reached 1649. This figure which covers the four-month period from July to the end of October is just 54 vehicles short of the total for the preceding six months. The data shows that between January and June the monthly average of UK used car imports was 283. During this period the lowest value was for February with 178 vehicles and the highest was in May at 367. In contrast during the post-Brexit period which saw the euro getting stronger against the pound thus increasing Maltese consumers’ spending power the respective monthly average soared to 412 cars. This figure amounts to a 46 per cent rise over the first half of the year. October topped the list with 468 vehicles followed by August with 425 and September with 422. With the exception of July the monthly total was significantly higher than any other previous month in 2016. Enquiries for luxury cars are on the rise In contrast there has been a drop in the number of brand new cars imported from the UK with a 20 per cent decline in the monthly average. In the first half of the year a total of 365 new vehicles from the UK were registered with TM which accounts for about 60 cars per month. However between July and the end of October the average dropped to 48 with the overall total being 194. Though the data does not give a detailed breakdown on what type of cars are being imported used car dealers who spoke with this newspaper but preferred to remain anonymous believe that there is an explanation behind this trend. “Since the start of summer enquiries for luxury cars like Aston Martin Bentley Ferrari and Lamborghini have been on the rise. Moreover the number of prospective buyers calling us for information increased when compared to a few months ago” the dealer said. “While on a normal car the savings due to the favourable exchange rate would be in the order of hundreds in the case of vehicles worth €40000 buyers would save thousands” they noted. Last month the sterling slid to a three-year low against the euro and a 31-year-low against the US dollar in the wake of the announcement by UK Prime Minister Theresa May that the formal departure process from the EU would begin by the end of next March. However following last week’s High Court ruling that the process could not be triggered without the British Parliament’s consent the pound reclaimed some of the lost ground. A week before the Brexit referendum the exchange rate translated into €1.26 for every pound but as recently as yesterday its value had shrunk to €1.12.

Photo: Reuters  British consumers brushed off June’s Brexit vote and drove the economy to expand faster than expected in the third quarter but a hefty current account gap and weaker trade and investment raised warning flags for 2017. The economy grew by 0.6 per cent in the three months to September above its long-run average and beating expectations in a Reuters poll of economists who expected the Office for National Statistics to stick with its earlier estimate of 0.5 per cent. The ONS also revised down growth for the second quarter to 0.6 per cent meaning there was no slowdown at all following June’s Brexit vote – confounding predictions at the time that the ‘Leave’ vote would push Britain’s economy into recession. With the large services sector continuing to perform well in October Britain’s economy looks on track to expand by more than two per cent this year – faster than almost all other big advanced economies except perhaps the United States. Sterling rose against the dollar after the data having hit a seven-week low earlier in the day. But yesterday’s figures showed no sign that sterling’s sharp fall after the referendum had boosted exports. The picture for trade worsened markedly and growth depended more on domestic consumer demand than previously thought. “Six months to the day after the Brexit vote it is clear that 2017 is likely to be a challenging period for the economy not least in assessing ‘traditional’ imbalances in the current account and the household sector” Investec chief economist Philip Shaw said. Economists polled by Reuters expect Britain’s growth rate to more than halve next year to 1.1 per cent. Household spending rose at a quarterly rate of 0.7 per cent in the third quarter but at the same time household incomes adjusted for inflation fell 0.6 per cent – the biggest drop since early 2014. Households also ate into their savings with the savings ratio dropping to its lowest in eight years. “With high inflation set to weigh further on spending power next year the consumer is surely set to falter soon” said Martin Beck economist at consultancy EY ITEM Club. Business investment also disappointed with the ONS more than halving its estimate for investment growth in the third quarter to 0.4 per cent. Net trade subtracted 1.2 percentage points from third quarter growth the biggest drag since early 2012 and compared with an initial estimate that trade had offered a 0.7 percentage point boost to the growth rate. This reflected corrections the ONS recently made to trade data due to a miscalculation in the trade of gold. Britain’s current account deficit widened to £25.494 billion from a downwardly revised £22.079 billion in the second quarter. While lower than the £27.45 billion expected by economists it caused the deficit to rise to 5.2 per cent of gross domestic product from 4.6 per cent – approaching a record 6.0 per cent seen in late 2013. In the run-up to June’s referendum Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said Britain relied on the “kindness of strangers” to meet its financing needs – something that could fade if Britain became a less attractive investment destination. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Neil Hall/Reuters Shares in Britain’s top banks suffered further deep losses yesterday as fears about the fallout from Brexit sparked a litany of earnings downgrades and sell-offs by shell-shocked investors. Shareholder anxiety about Britain’s decision to quit the EU escalated despite calls for calm from British Finance Minister George Osborne following a weekend of political chaos in Britain and the eurozone. Barclays Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland were among the hardest hit with falls of 11 per cent nine per cent and 14 per cent respectively in dramatic early trading that sent the STOXX Europe 600 bank index to its lowest since June 2012. After lauding efforts by banks to cut costs streamline operations and beef up balance sheets in recent months a string of analysts said the likelihood of catatonic interest rates and falling credit demand in the wake of Brexit had put earnings prospects and dividend growth at risk. “The market is justifiably concerned about the sustainability of earnings in a macroeconomically uncertain environment and the ability to withdraw excess capital” RBC Capital said in a note that slashed its price targets for British banks by 30 per cent. “UK rates markets are now pricing in a 25 basis point rate cut and no rate increases again until 2019. It seems at least that the uncertainty will lead to an economic slowdown” RBC said. European banks did not escape. Barclays analysts downgraded earnings expectations for a slew of continental lenders including Bankia Banco Populare Intesa UBI and Unicredit citing rising political risk and fading hopes for a lower cost of equity. “The risks of anti-EU contagion coupled with a number of binary events in the coming months – an Italian referendum in October US French and German elections beyond this – suggest it will be difficult for banks’ costs of equity to fall anytime soon” the Barclays note said. A spokesman for Italy’s Economy Ministry said yesterday the government was looking at various options to try and prop up the country’s bank stocks. After double-digit stock falls on Friday investor nerves were frayed further by the resignation of EU Commissioner Jonathan Hill on Saturday the man many hoped would renegotiate ‘passporting’ privileges that have turned British financial services into the country’s most lucrative exporters. JPMorgan used its note to highlight the mounting challenges faced by lenders with significant investment banking operations cutting 2018 earnings per share estimates for the sector by 28 per cent and rewriting recommendations for Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs Deutsche Bank UBS and Credit Suisse. JPMorgan estimated average 13 per cent earnings per share cuts in both 2017 and 2018 for European banks on the back of lower loan growth and expected increases in both bank funding costs and bad debt provisions. The Wall Street heavyweight downgraded all domestic-focused UK lenders to neutral and underweight positions but joined rival analysts at Deutsche Bank in conferring preferred status on Asia-focused Standard Chartered and Europe’s largest bank HSBC describing both as defensive options. Away from the stock markets ballooning credit default swap (CDS) prices offered further insight into wilting investor confidence in the ability of European banks to ride out the political and economic storm triggered by Brexit. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Unions warned families face an extra £580 a year bill if the country backs Brexit and retail chiefs said the impact of quitting would be \"catastrophic\". David Cameron\\'s former policy guru meanwhile claimed the Prime Minister was told four years ago that it was \"impossible\" for the Government to meet its immigration promises as long as the UK remained in the 28-member bloc. Research for The Daily Telegraph said the In camp was seven points ahead with 53% of the vote among those who intend to have their say at the ballot box. But the ORB International study found that when all voters are taken into account the Remain lead drops to two points on 49% compared to 47% for Leave. Exit poll supremo John Curtice a professor at Strathclyde University said the possibility of the UK quitting was being underestimated suggesting a 45% probability was a \"sensible\" assessment.

Former retail bosses including Tesco\\'s Sir Terry Leahy Marks and Spencer\\'s Marc Bolland and Sir Justin King from Sainsbury\\'s issued a price warning. In an open letter they said: \"We strongly believe that a Brexit will see less money in people\\'s pockets and be catastrophic for millions of ordinary families.\" Leave supporter Steve Hilton attacked the promises made by David Cameron over curbing immigration claiming the premier was told four years ago that it was \"impossible\" for the Government to meet its targets while Britain remained in the EU.

Mr Hilton said the premier reaffirmed his commitment to target in the 2015 general election even though he \"had been told it was undeliverable\". Writing in The Daily Mail the Leave campaigner recalled the details of a meeting in the final months of his time as director of strategy. He said: \"We were told directly and explicitly that it was impossible for the Government to meet its immigration target as long as we remained members of the EU which of course insists on the free movement of people within it. \"In the 2015 Conservative manifesto the Prime Minister reaffirmed his commitment to the immigration target he had been told was undeliverable\" he added. \"When I saw that I assumed this was either because he was certain he could negotiate a solution within the EU or was assuming we would leave.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Bank of England governor Mark Carney said yesterday that a hit to Britain’s economy from last month’s decision by voters to leave the European Union could prompt the bank to act hinting again that more stimulus is on the way. “If the outlook has worsened to use that term in the judgment of the MPC there always could be monetary response if that is consistent with its remit” Carney told MPs. Carney and his fellow members of the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee who have previously warned of a material hit to Britain’s economy from a Brexit vote are meeting this week meaning they are not supposed to talk about the outlook for interest rates in detail. The bank is due to announce whether it has cut rates or taken other action tomorrow. Carney has previously given a more explicit signal that the bank will act to cushion the impact of the vote. A week after the June 23 referendum he said he expected the bank to pump more stimulus into the economy over the summer. The sterling which hit a one-week high against the US dollar earlier yesterday buoyed by the quicker-than-expected appointment of a new British Prime Minister added to its gains as Carney and other BoE officials spoke yesterday. Investors expect the bank to cut interest rates below their already record low of 0.5 per cent as soon as tomorrow. However many economists have said the bank might wait until its next policy announcement on August 4 when it will have a better sense of the impact of the Leave decision on the economy. Investors expect the Bank to cut interest rates below their already record low of 0.5 per cent as soon as tomorrow Sam Hill an economist with RBC Capital Markets said he believed Carney’s comment within the limits of what he can say immediately before a policy announcement was in line with his previous steer about further stimulus soon. “I don’t discern a change in stance from the speech” Hill said. Carney also said yesterday that some of the pre-referendum criticism of the bank for its decision to spell out the economic risks of leaving the EU had been “extraordinary in all senses of the word”. He denied being influenced by Chancellor George Osborne one of the leaders of the Remain campaign and said he did not decide in advance what position the bank’s most important policymaking committees should take on the vote which resulted in a decision to leave the bloc. “I did not prejudge the minds of those policy committees nor could I. That’s not the way the system works that is not the way the system is set up” he said. Before the referendum the bank said a Brexit vote could cause a material slowdown in the economy. Carney said in May there was a chance of a recession angering some leading Leave supporters. One pro-Brexit lawmaker called on him to resign although senior Leave campaigners quickly sought to defuse the tensions after the vote. The chief investment officer of BlackRock the world’s largest asset manager said yesterday that Britain will fall into recession over the coming year. In his appearance in parliament Carney said it remained to be seen whether the bank’s decision to reduce a capital burden on banks and encourage lending would be met with increased demand for loans from businesses and households. “It won’t be supply constrained it won’t be a credit crunch it will be a function of the overall economic outlook which will be determined by decisions away from the financial sector” he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Excluding undecided voters 47 percent of respondents want to remain in the bloc. It is the first time that the Out campaign has come out ahead in the monthly Ipsos MORI telephone survey since Prime Minister David Cameron pledged in 2013 to hold a referendum the newspaper said. The results mark a major turnaround since a May poll by Ipsos MORI which found that just 37 percent wanted to leave against 55 percent who wanted to stay. Several polls have seen the \"Leave\" camp pushing ahead with a week to go before the June 23 vote. An analysis by JPMorgan researchers on Wednesday showed the \"Leave\" camp in the lead. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

As world politics and money markets reeled from the poll data from\\xa0Google\\xa0showed queries on citizenship in the Republic began to increase last night and peaked in the early hours of the morning. Likewise from lunchtime on referendum day searches on the web for information about moving to Ireland began to heat up and peaked in the early hours today.

Figures from Ireland\\'s Department of Foreign Affairs earlier this month showed the total number of Irish passport applications from Britain this year is 3334 - up very slightly from 3239 over the same period last year. Officials also cautioned that there have been significant fluctuations in recent years and applications from Britain were only a fraction of what they were from 2007-09. A Senator in the Irish parliament Neale Richmond urged passport officials to be ready for the so-called Cascarino effect recalling Jack Charlton\\'s tactic of picking British footballers with Irish heritage when he managed the Republic of Ireland. Mr Richmond who has two English cousins who recently applied for Irish passports said: \"British citizens with Irish grandparents applying for Irish passports could now move from a torrent to a flood.\" And in another development Google Trends showed many were seeking information about the EU indicating that a good number of those who cast or did not cast their vote yesterday were not aware about the implications.\\xa0 Google reported sharp upticks in searches not only related to the ballot measure but also about basic questions concerning the implications of the vote.

Unless Britain negotiates new trading relations with the EU banks insurers and fund managers in Britain could be locked out of the bloc\\'s markets when it leaves the EU in March 2019. The International Regulatory Strategy Group (IRSG) said in the draft report to be submitted to the British government in September that such a trade pact would allow UK firms to operate in the EU without the cost of having a local licence. \"The proposals in the report are intended to achieve a level of mutual access for EU and UK firms which is as close as possible to the current levels of access that exist for such firms within the EU framework\" the report said. It admitted negotiating such a pact could be challenging. Other EU capitals have been vying to attract London\\'s financial businesses since the Brexit vote. Currently banks authorised in London can \"passport\" or offer their services to customers across the EU without the need for a licence in each country but this will end when Britain leaves forcing the country to agree new trading terms. No such trade pact in financial services has been tried before and the report said it was \"ambitious in its intent\". Initially the financial sector called for continued full passporting rights after Brexit which is being negotiated over two years since Britain triggered the process in March following a referendum vote in June last year. The new proposals mark a departure from that stance a recognition that the EU is likely to rule out future passporting. The IRSG is sponsored by the City of London Corporation home to London\\'s \"Square Mile\" financial district and TheCityUK Britain\\'s most powerful financial lobby. Its report sets out how a trade pact for financial services could be structured and policed by a new dispute resolution body with powers to sanction breaches. Punishment could include withdrawal of mutual access rights the payment of \"compensation\" in the form of offsetting trade benefits or retaliatory steps such as measures that affect an equivalent value of trade the report said. No such trade pact in financial services has been tried before and the report said it was \"ambitious in its intent\". Britain\\'s finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment. TheCityUK chief executive Miles Celic told Reuters he has already been making the case for mutual recognition during visits to Brussels and other European capitals. \"The general response has been that while ambitious it is not unrealistic\" he said. The future of London as Europe\\'s financial centre is one of the biggest issues in Brexit talks because it is Britain\\'s largest export sector and biggest source of tax with rival cities battling to draw highly-paid banking jobs and the revenue that they bring with it. Few banks and insurers believe such a trade pact can be in place by March 2019 and some have already announced they are opening locally licensed subsidiaries in the EU to avoid being cut off from customers on the continent. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Frankfurt could become a miniature version of London after Brexit a city official has predicted after a study said tens of thousands of jobs would be created bolstering Germany\\'s banking capital. The research commissioned by the city\\'s chief promoter is the first comprehensive tally on possible job creation in Frankfurt as London its dominant British rival prepares for life outside the EU. The analysis predicts there will 10000 bankers and finance professionals in Frankfurt within four years and that their arrival could create more than 41000 further jobs from estate agents to taxi drivers and building workers. Frankfurt and Dublin have emerged as the most popular centres and the Germany city\\'s international schools have seen a deluge of calls as bankers anticipate a move \"It\\'s not the City of London but perhaps it can become a little London\" said Oliver Schwebel chief executive of Frankfurt Economic Development the state agency that promotes the city known for skyscrapers that house Deutsche Bank and others. Britain\\'s departure from the EU has prompted banks and investors in London to examine other cities to keep a foothold in the bloc allowing them to sell across the continent without additional costs or trade hurdles after Brexit. Frankfurt and Dublin have emerged as the most popular centres and the Germany city\\'s international schools have seen a deluge of calls as bankers anticipate a move. Morgan Stanley Citigroup and JPMorgan say Frankfurt will be their EU trading base after Brexit. Some remain sceptical of the German city whose culinary attractions include local ciders and sausages But some remain sceptical of the German city whose culinary attractions include local ciders and sausages but where night life is subdued and cafes remain largely empty during the working week. A common local joke is that the best thing about the city is its airport which makes it easy to leave. The study commissioned by city promoter Frankfurt Main Finance comes as Frankfurt attempts to discard its small-town image. It is also an attempt to persuade sceptical locals of the economic benefits in welcoming London bankers. Many residents are worried about being squeezed out of an already expensive property market in a city some have dubbed \"Bankfurt\". At a press conference to outline the findings Schwebel was forced to defend the city\\'s record on providing affordable accommodation to locals. The city\\'s population has jumped by more than 10% since 2010 while a property boom across Germany has seen house prices and rents in cities such as Frankfurt rise sharply. Although it remains small by international standards with roughly 730000 inhabitants the supply of property is tight partly because the city wants to keep its large green belt of forests and parks. Schwebel faced a series of critical questions from German journalists about whether attracting such high earners from London was desirable in what turned into an at times noisy debate. \"They (local residents) won\\'t be pushed out\" he said. Lutz Johanning the author of the study said Frankfurt was more likely in any event to attract risk and regulatory experts rather than investment bankers. The city is already home to the European Central Bank which monitors lenders. \"Frankfurt won\\'t have the glitter jobs\" Johanning said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May and other EU leaders voiced renewed confidence on Thursday that they could secure a Brexit deal saying they were working hard to overcome the very same hurdles that only days ago brought the talks to a halt. Less than six months before Britain quits the EU in its biggest shift in policy for more than 40 years the two sides are at odds over how to deal with their only land border between the British province of Northern Ireland and Ireland. The problem centres on a so-called backstop - an insurance policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland a former focal point for sectarian tensions if a future trading relationship is not in place in time. To try to unlock the talks May had earlier signalled she would consider extending a so-called transition period \"for a matter of months\" after Britain leaves the EU in March a move her critics called a betrayal but one which the bloc welcomed. Extending the transition period could mean that if a future partnership is not ready a backstop which so far has been unpalatable to the British side would not have to be triggered. But even an extension would not get rid of the EU\\'s insistence that such a backstop must be agreed to secure a deal. For now both sides seemed to be happy to kick any solution to that problem a little bit further down the road. \"We are all working we\\'re intensifying the work on these issues that remain\" May told a news conference after a two-day summit in Brussels had ended. \"What I\\'ve had from leaders around the table ... since I arrived here in Brussels yesterday is a very real sense that people want that deal to be done.\" \"I am confident that we can achieve that good deal.\" Transition EU leaders also voiced a new optimism after the last summit in the Austrian city of Salzburg ended in acrimony with May irritated that the EU had criticised her Brexit plans in a particularly damaging way. EU Council President Donald Tusk described the mood as being much better than Salzburg. \"What I feel today is that we are closer to the final solutions and the deal\" he told a news conference. Jean-Claude Juncker EU Commission president said: \"It will be done.\" But behind the positive noises one side will have to compromise to find a way to as German Chancellor Angela Merkel said \"to square the circle\" of the Northern Irish border. On arriving at the second day of the summit May said a \"further idea\" had emerged an idea to extend the transition phase beyond December 2020 that caused uproar among some Brexit supporters back in Britain. May and a senior British government official tried to play down the significance of the consideration of such an extension saying it had only \"come up in negotiations in recent days\" and that it was one of several options to help move the talks on - something London desperately wants to see. And a French official said any extension would come with conditions attached - it would not be automatic it would be decided closer to the time and that it would have to be agreed by the leaders of the 27 other EU nations probably unanimously. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar summed it up by saying big gaps remained between the two sides. \"A lot of things have been agreed but there are still big gaps both in terms of the shape of the future relationship and also the protocol on Northern Ireland and Ireland and the backstop\" he told reporters. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Europe's share markets fell back into the red yesterday as investor worries about slowing global growth in the face of rising US interest rates and trade tensions outweighed crucial Brexit progress. Chinese markets had extended their slump in Asia amid the trade war with the United States and with Wall Street closed later for Thanksgiving and trading therefore lighter than normal Europe followed suit. A disappointing batch of company earnings added to the stocks gloom but Italian bonds rallied for a second day as sparring continued over its budget and sterling jumped as London and Brussels agreed wording on a Brexit transition deal. The dollar also edged lower for a second day as traders sold the greenback going into Thanksgiving and after Wall Street had seen Apple shares which have slumped $280 billion in recent weeks fail with an attempted rebound. Europe's tech sector duly lost another 0.75 per cent but it wasn't the worst performer. Banks fell as much as 1.6 per cent and mining companies and other resources firms dropped nearly two per cent before clawing some ground back. The falls also reflected the bitter Sino-US trade war encouraging investors to take money off the table before US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping meet next week. Countries belonging to the G20 group of the world's biggest economies applied 40 new restrictive measures between mid-May and mid-October covering around $481 billion of trade the World Trade Organisation said yesterday. Three-quarters of the restrictions were tariff hikes many of them retaliation to steel and aluminium tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump in March. Sterling jumped back up to $1.29 and 88.50 pence per euro after London and Brussels agreed on a text setting out their post-split ties that EU leaders are expected to endorse at a summit on Sunday. The Brexit text had also seen the euro rise against the dollar which meant the single currency barely budged when ECB meeting minutes showed its policymakers were keen to affirm their plans to cut stimulus at the end of the year. Back in emerging economy share markets MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had ended little changed after recovering from an initial wobble. The index has managed to hold up so far in November after three straight monthly declines but is on track for its worst annual performance since 2011. Japan's Nikkei had finished almost 0.7 per cent higher but the ongoing trade and tech jitters saw shares close 0.4 per cent in the red. US crude futures were last down 42 cents at $54.21 a barrel after hitting a one-year low of $52.77 on Tuesday. Brent eased 45 cents to $63.03 off Tuesday's low of $61.71.

Photo: Shutterstock  Britain\\'s tortuous breakup with the European Union took a bizarre turn Monday after it emerged that London has awarded an emergency ferry services contract to a company without any ships. Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s government is ramping up preparations to avert chaos should Britain split from the EU in March without an agreement on future trade ties. May\\'s cabinet will meet next week for more \"no-deal Brexit\" planning in case the British parliament fails to approve a draft deal London and Brussels have reached after nearly two years of talks. The plan is deeply unpopular in London and May was forced to abort a December debate about the arrangement after admitting it faced heavy defeat. A new vote in the House of Commons is scheduled for the week starting on January 14. But the cabinet\\'s bid to show it was ready for anything was set back when the BBC discovered the ferry contract awarded to a firm without any actual vessels in place. Britain reached three commercial agreements to move cargo should the main cross-Channel sea route grind to a halt after Brexit takes place on March 29. Two of them went to established companies in Denmark and France. The smallest of the three was won by Seaborne Freight -- a London-based firm that only intends to start providing ferry services next year. Britain\\'s transport department did not explain why Seaborne was handed the £13.8 million (€15.4 million) deal. \"This contract was awarded in the full knowledge that Seaborne Freight is a new shipping provider and that the extra capacity and vessels would be provided as part of its first services\" the ministry said in a statement released to AFP. \"As with all contracts we carefully vetted the company\\'s commercial technical and financial position in detail before making the award.\" But a local councillor said it seemed unlikely that Seaborne could have everything set up in time. \"Why choose a company that never moved a single truck in their entire history and give them £14 million?\" councillor Paul Messenger asked. \"I don\\'t understand the logic of that.\" \\'Reeks\\'\\xa0 May\\'s critics in the Labour main opposition party also pounced. \"Nothing could sum Brexit up better than the utter stench of this latest (transport department) mess. Reeks\" said Labour MP Neil Coyle. The BBC said the narrow berths at Ramsgate port in southeast England made them unsuitable for most existing commercial ships. The port has not been used commercially since 2013. Seaborne said in a statement that it has spent two years working on plans to get Ramsgate up and running by early 2019. \"It was intended to start the service in mid-February but this has now been delayed until late March for operational reasons\" Seaborne said. Seaborne chief executive Ben Sharp told the BBC he planned to start operations with two ships before \"very quickly\" expanding that number to four. The ferries are due to link up Britain with Belgium. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Adrian Delia urged the government to inform Maltese businesses of the possible Brexit scenarios. “Is the government informing those with economic interests in the UK where they stand? If the agreement persists as is what are the new circumstances? And if it does not what are the consequences” he asked during the weekly Sunday interview on Net FM. The PN leader insisted that the government needed to speak to those in business about the possible Brexit outcomes as businesses did not plan things overnight. Uncertainty in business had investment and profitability consequences - there were a lot of businesses that depended on UK commerce he added. Read: Merkel briefly stuns audience with Brexit response During the interview Dr Delia also referred to a statement by the European Commission for Democracy through Law better known as the Venice Commission which on Friday said that the Office of the Prime Minister was at “the centre of power”. According to the Council of Europe's rule of law experts Malta needed better checks and balances to ensure proper rule of law. The full position document is expected to be published this week. He noted that the criticised systems had been in place for several years however it was up to the current government to elect and retain the people leading institutions. According to Dr Delia the report was exposing loopholes now more than ever.He added that four years – the remaining office time for the current administration – was enough time for the government to do what was best for the country. However he raised concern over reports that Education Minister Evarist Bartolo was to be nominated President. Watch: Bartolo downplays talk of presidential post Noting that a Nationalist government had elected a person from the opposing camp: George Abela he questioned whether the current government was able to do something similar. “Let the choice of a new President be the first sign of reform with the elected person not being partisan hailing from one camp. We can then start constitutional reform strengthening the institutions” he urged. There needs to be institutional maturity not just economic growth Dr Delia insisted. During his address the Opposition leader expressed solidarity with head of Alleanza Bidla Ivan Grech Mintoff who told Net News he had received life threats following his comments on Neville Gafa. Mr Gafà was thrust into the spotlight last month when Times of Malta reported he had travelled to Libya and according to official communications from Tripoli met with government ministers in his capacity of “special envoy of the Prime Minister”. While people were not obliged not to agree with him they should defend his right of expression he said. “The biggest protection we can provide as a society is to ensure that he is heard… as a country we need to show people that when they speak up about something serious such as in this case others will join them to ask the same questions.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May risks another humiliating Brexit defeat at the hands of her own eurosceptic MPs on Thursday with just weeks to go until Britain officially leaves the EU. Parliament will hold a symbolic vote calling for May to renegotiate her deal\\'s unpopular \"backstop\" provision and also to rule out leaving the European Union without a deal as agreed in House of Commons votes last month. But eurosceptics in the Conservative party\\'s European Research Group (ERG) could abstain from the vote threatening defeat for May. \"Conservative MPs really ought not to be associated with anything express or implied which seems to take no deal off the table\" said leading ERG member Steve Baker. \"Compromising no deal would be the daftest negotiating strategy and not in the national interest.\" He criticised the government for making MPs vote on whether to support both measures agreed by parliament last month -- even if they disagree with one -- or hand their own government an embarrassing defeat. A senior source within the ERG said the group would abstain according to the Daily Telegraph which would spell almost certain defeat for May given Labour\\'s opposition to the motion. But leading Brexiteer Liam Fox warned colleagues that such a result would raise doubts about whether a renegotiated deal could get through parliament making the EU less likely to make on offer. \"Our European partners will be watching our debate and listening today to see if they get the impression that if they were to make those concessions parliament would definitely deliver\" trade minister Fox told BBC Radio 4. \"There\\'s a danger that we send the wrong signals.\" Talks at \\'crucial stage\\' May\\'s initial deal was roundly rejected by British MPs last month but later parliamentary votes suggested a slim majority for her deal if she could get rid of the backstop clause. The provision is intended to keep the border with Ireland free-flowing but some fear it could leave Britain trapped in EU trade rules indefinitely with no withdrawal mechanism. British officials have since held a series of meeting with EU counterparts who have ruled out reopening negotiations. \"The talks are at a crucial stage. We now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this house requires and deliver Brexit on time\" May told lawmakers on Tuesday. \"Having secured an agreement with the EU for further talks we now need some time to complete that process\" she said. The announcement was seen by political commentators as an attempt to stave off the threat of parliamentary rebellion with MPs now having to wait until February 27 for another series of votes on what to do if no agreement is reached. Business leaders and economists have warned of shockwaves around the continent if no transition deal is in place when Britain leaves the EU. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The International Monetary Fund has downgraded its forecast for UK economic growth over fears of disruption if Britain votes to leave the European Union on June 23. In its World Economic Outlook the global financial body warned that Brexit could inflict \"severe regional and global damage\" by disrupting trade relations. Negotiations over post-exit arrangements would probably be \"protracted\" leading to an \"extended\" period of uncertainty and market volatility. The IMF scaled back its projection of UK economic growth for 2016 by 0.3 percentage points to 1.9% - marginally below the 2% forecast of the Government\\'s Office for Budget Responsibility - but held its forecast for 2017 at 2.2%. The IMF\\'s downgrade comes on the same day of an ICM poll suggesting the \\'exit\\' camp is ahead by three percentage points. \\xa0According to the poll\\xa0support for Britain to leave the European Union stands at 45 percent.

The president of the European Council has said he still wants Britain to remain part of the EU minutes after Theresa May told him there was no going back on\\xa0Brexit. Donald Tusk said he would be the \"happiest one\" if the UK reversed the decision to quit and stuck with the bloc for years to come. His admission came at an early-hours press conference following a dinner with all EU leaders where Prime Minister Mrs May insisted there would be no second referendum. She told her counterparts directly that Britain would be leaving after suggestions in Europe that the referendum result could be revisited. If it is reversible or not this is in the British hands But at the end of the summit dinner Mr Tusk told reporters: \"It\\'s not our choice and if you ask me I would prefer 28 members not only for the next month but also for the next years and decades. \"After the decision in the UK we have to respect the decision of the referendum. If it is reversible or not this is in the British hands. \"I would be the happiest one if it reversible but we now we have to start our formal works.\" At the European Council Mrs May was told Britain would not be given an easy ride as it severs ties with Brussels. French president Francois Hollande warned the UK would face \"hard\" negotiations if it wanted to make a clean break with the bloc and European Parliament president Martin Schulz urged European leaders to \"stand firm\" in negotiations with Britain. Leaders will discuss trade rules when the European Council continues today including anti-dumping measures. Mrs May will then hold talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker which No 10 sources said would be an \"opportunity to establish a relationship\" and talk about \"how we see the process ahead\". \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Phil Noble/Reuters  The pound’s plunge since Britain voted to leave the European Union is good news for factory boss Tony Hague. He has received enquiries from potential buyers outside the country tempted by the lower prices for his company’s products as sterling has sunk to a 31-year low against the dollar after the June 23 referendum which sparked pandemonium in British politics and financial markets. But customers of Hague’s company PP Automation and Control are also seeking something he cannot give: assurances about the future of British trade with the remaining 27 nations of the EU bloc and with the wider world. They are wondering what Brexit will mean for Britain’s ability to sell abroad in the long term. “We’re already having some of our customers in Germany for example asking for some statements and some thoughts about what (the Brexit vote) might mean longer term” Hague PP Automation and Control’s managing director said at the headquarters of his company in the industrial West Midlands town of Walsall. “And of course no one can provide any answers” he said at the plant which still flies a blue EU flag dotted with gold stars representing the bloc’s member states alongside Britain’s Union Jack. The lack of clarity reflects the wider uncertainties in Britain once viewed as one of the West’s most stable democracies since the 52-48 per cent Brexit vote tipped British politics into its biggest crisis of modern times. After previous downward lurches in sterling – such as in the wake of Black Wednesday in 1992 when Britain crashed out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism – exports rose sharply. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said any benefit this time could be dampened because foreign buyers are unclear about what trade deals a post-Brexit Britain will forge with the world while the pace of global economic growth remains lacklustre. Business surveys have pointed to early signs of a drop in business confidence in Britain since the referendum although a Reuters poll of economists showed the Bank will probably wait until August to make a policy move to address Brexit’s impact. “I think exports will disappoint” said Samuel Tombs economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Growth will pick up because of the weaker pound but if you are an exporter you are facing the most uncertainty of anyone at the moment.” Companies like PP are the first link in the supply chain. Almost all of its products end up exported either directly to machinery manufacturers in Europe or Asia or indirectly through British firms who sell goods abroad. Manufacturers account for only around 10 per cent of British economic output but employ 2.7 million people and create about 45 per cent of the country’s exports nearly half of which went to European Union countries last year. Vehicles aircraft machinery and computer products topped the list of manufacturing exports. The manufacturing sector was a key battleground in the referendum debate because of its exposure to world trade. Supporters of keeping Britain in the EU said it made no sense for the country to distance itself from the buyers of the country’s exports and from the bloc’s trade deals with other nations around the world. Leave campaigners said the EU would cut a deal with Britain because of its economic importance but insisted that London be given the right to restrict immigration from EU countries. Now factories are under the spotlight again as investors and economists look for an early steer on how the economy has reacted since the Brexit vote. The first clear sign is likely to come on August 1 when financial firm Markit will publish its manufacturing purchasing managers index for the month of July. Tombs the economist said that until Britain’s trading relationships outside the EU becomes clear manufacturers are likely to be reticent about investing to increase their capacity to export. The manufacturing industry association EEF also sounded cautious. “In general the anecdotal reports are that orders have gone quiet and that manufacturers are putting their recruitment and investment plans on hold” said Zach Witton deputy chief economist at EEF. For some manufacturers the weak pound will drive up import costs – whether due to the higher cost of crude oil which is denominated in dollars or goods from eurozone countries. “There will be higher input costs into our businesss: we buy quite a lot of raw materials from Europe and we’re starting to see costs on those rise” said Jonathan Lane sales director at Arrow Solutions a cleaning chemicals manufacturer based in a former mining village of Moira Derbyshire. But the company also sees opportunity to expand in high growth regions like China which could help it achieve its ambition to increase exports to two thirds of its business by 2020 from around half now. “We quoted on a quite substantial piece of business in China yesterday and when we came to look at the numbers we found we were in a much better position than when we looked at the project earlier – purely because of the exchange rate change” said Lane. For PP’s Hague who is pressing on with investment plans sterling’s weakness offers a bit of relief. “This time last year when the euro was running at about 1.4 (to the pound) it was killing some of our customers” he said. PP founded in 1967 – the year Britain’s prime minister Harold Wilson devalued sterling – counts among its clients global machinery manufacturers like Mazak and Ishida Europe while Mitsubishi Electric and Siemens are technical partners. The company’s first decade was marked by economic turmoil and by the time current chairman and chief executive officer David Fox arrived in 1979 business was “flat as a pancake”. But by the early 1990s it attracted its first big overseas customer Japanese machinery maker Yamazaki Mazak which opened the door to contracts with the likes of Toyota which began car assembly in nearby Derbyshire in 1992. PP moved into its current premises about 20 years ago where the shop floor has tripled in size. This year the company is on track for £20 million in sales. On a recent morning around 200 staff in red shirts were busy assembling machinery and producing reams of cables in the factory. Hague says he is optimistic not only because the weak pound will help sales abroad. He also says British firms supplying British clients who will be better able to compete in the domestic market now that imports are more expensive – because it will take more pounds to buy every dollar or euro-based product. Hague said PP staff move frequently between its British headquarters and a subsidiary in Germany where it is expanding highlighting the company’s need for continued free movementof labour between Britain and the European Union. “We’re desperate to get a German-speaking engineer working at this end as well as in Germany” said Fox who has guided the company through three recessions. Fox added that the very few skilled engineers available to companies like PP are much more likely to be Polish say than British. Some of PP’s overseas customers have asked Hague for the British government’s official stance on future trade deals. That has been harder to provide. A spokesman for Britain’s business ministry said the trade minister Mark Price had written to a number of British companies and foreign firms investing in Britain and told them that the government trade policy would address their needs. Nonetheless Hague is worried by the lack of a detailed strategy. “There’s nothing available which I think is completely appalling.” (Reuters) \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  British companies are preparing for the possibility that the country will vote to leave the European Union with extra funds pre-written statements and plans for late-night vigils by teams of consultants. In the final week before Britain’s refe\\xadrendum on EU membership on Thursday the prospect of a ‘Leave’ vote has come into sharp focus prompting a last-minute flurry of preparations in the corridors of ‘UK plc’. Much of the focus is on communication – how to assure customers employees and investors that there will be near-term business continuity in the event of an ‘Out’ vote. Britain would have two years to negotiate its exit or ‘Brexit’ from the 28-country bloc. Treasury departments will also be working overtime because a vote for a Brexit would be expected to roil currency markets and have major consequences for trade the economy and migration in Britain and elsewhere. Many companies have yet to work out detailed plans as any post-Brexit picture is unclear and opinion polls had until recently suggested the ‘Remain’ camp was comfortably ahead. But some have sprung into action since the momentum in the polls swung towards the ‘Leave’ camp in the latter stages of campaigning which was suspended last Thursday after a British MP was killed. “The nearness of the vote and sudden increased likelihood of Brexit has definitely sharpened client appetite for draft statements” said a senior executive at a public relations firm one of three who said last week there had been an increase in client requests for communications advice. As of February more than three-quarters of Britain’s FTSE 250 companies had not made any contingency plans for a possible exit according to a survey published in April by the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors. More than 60 per cent said they planned to do so but the uncertainty at that time made it impossible. For many export-orientated multinationals in the FTSE 100 index violent currency swings on the morning of June 24 are the top concern. “The biggest short-term impact and the biggest headache for us is going to be sterling” said the head of strategy at one top-10 FTSE company. While chief executives generally back ‘Remain’ on the grounds that unfettered access to Europe’s market of about 500 million consumers is good for business a short-term fall in sterling on a ‘Leave’ vote would make exports cheaper and could boost sales while a ‘Remain’ vote could see the currency jump. Either way it spells volatility for sterling-denominated earnings at businesses including engineering firms Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline drinks group Diageo and British American Tobacco. Richard De Meo managing director of Foenix Partners a foreign exchange specialist for British companies said many corporate treasury departments were now escalating currency decisions up the chain of command. The EU is worried. We are an important part of it and you risk a domino effect “There can be serious business risks to them sticking to long-term policies in a situation like this. They are in communication with the chairman the MDs (managing directors) the board” he said. Some companies have also been keeping open lines of credit in case Brexit-related volatility increases their need for cash. Vodafone which boosted its short-term borrowing capabilities this year during merger talks with US cable company Liberty Global has said it is grateful it has that funding in place for now. “Once we’re through uncertainty you would expect the (commercial paper) to drop down” Vodafone CFO Nick Read told analysts in May. “There’s no other uses of cash. It’s just more I would argue timing and tactical.” Several executives said they were concerned about managing relations with international employees customers suppliers and shareholders immediately after the results are announced on Friday. While there were no plans to issue public statements to the stock market several executives said they would be likely to communicate with stakeholders in the event of a Leave vote. “I would want to reassure our European partners that this is not something they should regard as a hostile act” said Miles Young chairman of advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather part of British group WPP. Another senior FTSE 100 executive told Reuters the company would bring in external lawyers and consultants on Thursday for backup if this was necessary. “One thing we need to do immediately is to engage in a very serious dialogue after the 24th with customers to identify both opportunities and challenges in the ongoing relationship” said the executive.“They may say ‘come back in two years to talk to us’ or they may want to talk then.” One senior executive at a public relations firm said he planned to stay in a central London hotel on Thursday night to be close to the office. He also expected most of the firm’s public affairs team to work late on Thursday and come to work early on Friday to watch and analyse the results on behalf of multinational clients. “As their public affairs eyes and ears they’re expecting us to do... most of the watching and analysis for them” he said. “I’m not telling people they have to stay on the floor or anything but if they can get in earlier than usual that would be helpful.” After issuing weekly bulletins to clients in the past few months he said he would update them shortly after the polls close at 2100 GMT on Thursday and then again around 0600 GMT the next day. In the financial services sector where a Brexit vote will echo the loudest large banks including Citi and Goldman Sachs will have senior traders working through the night which is set to be among the most volatile 24 hours for markets in a quarter of a century. A FTSE 100 finance director said there would also be concern about what a Brexit would mean for the rest of the EU. “We will have to reassure clients” the director said. “The EU is worried. We are an important part of it and you risk a domino effect. We’re in the hands of the gods.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Madness paid a special tribute to the \"great great David Bowie\" as they brought their Glastonbury Festival set to a close with his 1971 hit Kooks. Beneath the Aladdin Sane lightning bolt suspended above the Pyramid Stage frontman and radio DJ Suggs said he wanted to celebrate the late music superstar. The band brought their families up on stage to dance along to Kooks which was written by Bowie to his newborn son. Lyrics include: \"We bought a lot of things / To keep you warm and dry / And a funny old crib on which the paint won\\'t dry\". The band also gave a nod to the Brexit vote making clear the country is on the \"highway to hell\". Suggs handed the microphone to guitarist Chris Foreman who said he had recently learnt how easy it was to fool 51.9% of people - referencing the percentage of Britons who voted to leave the European Union in Thursday\\'s referendum. He then led the crowd in a rendition of the AC/DC song Highway To Hell. Suggs began the set by taking fans back to the 70s starting his performance with long shaggy brown hair - and after performing the band\\'s hit Embarrassment he welcomed the audience to Top Of The Pops 1979 introducing \"a bunch of spotty perverts from North London\". Revealing the joke he pulled off the wig saying to the audience: \"You didn\\'t think it was real you slags!\" Madness then performed their first ever single from 1979 The Prince. The band also got the crowd jumping with fan favourites including Our House It Must Be Love and Baggy Trousers. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Brexit could be the main concern for the international logistics sector especially if there is a meltdown of trade agreements transit conventions and security agreements according to Franco Azzopardi chairman and CEO of Express Trailers. “Although the UK is aiming for a Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) practice shows that this will be difficult to apply before the end of the transitional period” he said. Mr Azzopardi said 2018 was a milestone year for Express Trailers as the local logistics sector positively correlated to the national policy of growth in the population continued to yield a heightened demand for consumer goods. “From an operational perspective we consolidated our hubbing and ‘warehousing as a managed service’ concept with the completion of the new 2800sqm warehouse facility in Qormi. We also set up our new company Express Trailers Engineering with the objective of serving our maintenance needs and to serve Hammar Maskin of Sweden in rebuilding reengineered side-loaders.” Referring to the company’s priorities and goals for 2019 Mr Azzopardi explained how from a commercial aspect one of the priorities is going to be ShipLowCost.com’s B2B service which is now adding export service for online sales done by Malta-based retailers. “Internally our topmost efforts will be trained on the implementation of a three-year IT project that will see our opera\\xadtions using best-of-breed logistic planning and administration core systems” he said. “The roll-out of our new core logistics and transport IT platform will pose the most significant challenge for our people but it is a project to which we have been giving a lot of energy over the past three years. I am very confident that this will continue to position Express Trailers as the foremost logistics operator on the island” he added. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 07:01  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Those concerns caused the Fed to shift to wait-and-see mode after raising interest rates four times in 2018 after \"volatility in financial markets and increased concerns about global growth made the appropriate extent and timing of future rate increases more uncertain than earlier.\" And the prospects that Britain will leave the European Union without an agreement could create \"a wide range of economic and financial activities could be disrupted\" despite preparations. \"Without such a withdrawal agreement there will be no transition period for important trade and financial interactions between UK and EU residents.\" The report was prepared for Congress to accompany the twice-yearly testimony by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who will appear Tuesday and Wednesday to answer questions about monetary policy. Powell and other central bankers late last year pivoted sharply away from expectations that more increases in the lynchpin for borrowing costs would be needed this year.\\xa0 Instead they clearly and repeatedly signaled they will pause for now. The report cited tariffs as a key risk to rising inflation but falling oil prices and a strong dollar could dampen inflation. In fact the trade tensions with China -- which are subject to high-stakes negotiations this week -- are mentioned more than 20 times in the nearly 60-page report. The report repeated that the Fed continued to expect the US economy to put in a solid performance this year with inflation approaching the 2.0 per cent target. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photos: Neil Hall/Reuters  Uncertainty caused by Britain’s vote to leave the EU is making Lush an English-based retailer of handmade cosmetics look to continental Europe to protect its production sales and multinational workforce. Based on the south coast – an area that opted strongly in favour of Brexit in last month’s referendum – Lush says a volatile pound since then has created “a living nightmare”. Now the firm is giving European staff the opportunity to move to a new factory in the German city of Düsseldorf. While the decision to build the second plant was taken last year Lush is relieved to have a foothold in a country that will remain in the EU while politicians set about renegotiating Britain’s relationship with the bloc from scratch. “Even before the vote when we were asking the tough questions nobody seemed to have answers of what Brexit would mean. There didn’t seem to be a plan” Hilary Jones a director at Lush said. “But the German factory may be a salvation for us. Now we are really thanking our lucky stars that we did that.” Supporters of Brexit have argued that a steep fall in the pound since the June 23 referendum offers British manufacturers a golden opportunity to export more competitively. Those economic migrants have really helped us grow our British business But Lush which imports many of its raw materials doesn’t see it that way. Dusseldorf will supply continental customers while the existing plant in the town of Poole which voted 58.2 percent to leave the EU will keep catering for a British market beset by uncertainty although it will also export. British consumer confidence suffered one of its biggest drops in 21 years according to a survey published on Friday and the country’s largest department store group John Lewis expressed concern over the pound’s fall. Jones said no jobs in Britain would be under threat. But staff at the Poole plant – which has 1400 workers of 38 nationalities – were being offered the chance to fill vacancies in the Dusseldorf factory. Furthermore Dusseldorf aims to supply most mainland European markets by the end of the 2015/16 financial year. A woman looking at the different soaps on display at a Lush store. “We can now offer them jobs in Germany within the eurozone. We will certainly be moving some production. We were always planning to move European production there but now we could make it much bigger than we had ever intended if Brexit means we have to do that” Jones said. The group reported profit before tax of £4.5 million in 2015. Jones said that while it was sticking to forecasts of a 19 per cent production rise for the moment that target is under review every day and what used to be monthly board meetings now happen “at least once a week”. During the referendum campaign the pro-Brexit side argued that leaving would allow Britain to control numbers of EU workers especially from poorer eastern member states coming to the country. The vote has left those already in Britain unsure of their future status. Jones said Poole had not been large enough to supply enough local workers for the plant there and she paid tribute to the foreign employees. “Those economic migrants have really helped us grow our British business” he said. Volatility in the foreign exchange markets is also affecting the business. Lush imports ingredients from all over the world to Britain for production and while it already sells products to markets such as Japan and the United States the ructions in sterling increase the need for it to sell more outside the UK. “We’re bringing ingredients in and we’re shipping finished goods out” Jones said. “We’re exposed on every level from each direction. So it’s a bit of a living nightmare at the moment.” Jones says that as a British firm it will always be in the country. But having seen a drop in sales on a like-for-like basis on the day after the vote Lush believes it can already feel consumer wariness “through the tills”. “We don’t feel like we’re about to abandon Britain” she said but added: “We’re on a roller coaster and we’re certainly on it with the rest of the country but luckily for us we’ve also got footholds elsewhere.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Updated 1.30pm with timeline Prime Minister Theresa May will trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty the formal notification of the United Kingdom\\'s intention to leave the European Union on Wednesday week a spokesman for the British leader said today. \"Last June the people of the UK made the historic decision to leave the EU. Next Wednesday the government will deliver on that decision and formally start the process by triggering Article 50\" Brexit minister David Davis said in a statement. The move will begin a two-year negotiating period in which the British government and the EU hope to agree on the terms of Britain\\'s exit and reach a separate deal on the shape of their future relationship most importantly on the terms of trade between the two. \"We are on the threshold of the most important negotiation for this country for a generation\" Davis said. \"The government is clear in its aims: a deal that works for every nation and region of the UK and indeed for all of Europe – a new positive partnership between the UK and our friends and allies in the European Union.\" EU Commission president Jean Claude Juncker is expected to be in Malta on that day and will meet Prime Minister Joseph Muscat. The Prime Minister\\'s letter officially notifying the European Council of the UK\\'s intention to quit will set in train a two-year negotiation process expected to lead to Britain leaving the EU on March 29 2019. Within 48 hours of the UK triggering Article 50 I will present the draft #Brexit guidelines to the EU27 Member States.— Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) March 20 2017 Within 48 hours of the UK triggering Article 50 I will present the draft #Brexit guidelines to the EU27 Member States. So what happens from now on? DIRECTIVES May - Ministers in the EU\\'s normally low-key General Affairs Council will be called again excluding Britain to agree legal \"negotiating directives\" that will bind Barnier and his team. FACE TO FACE After nearly a year of phoney war since the June 23 referendum vote to quit British negotiators led by Brexit Secretary David Davis will sit down with the EU possibly still in May. Talks may start with what to discuss first and how to split up topics. THE DIVORCE DEAL December 2017 - Brussels wants a basic deal on a Withdrawal Treaty by year\\'s end. Key issues: the exit bill for Britain\\'s outstanding commitments; treatment of British and EU expats; dealing with outstanding EU legal cases; new border rules.  TRANSITION TO FUTURE RELATIONSHIP 2018 - May wants to negotiate a comprehensive free trade deal. Few see two years as enough time to agree one and Brussels wants to hold off starting talks until after a divorce deal. But London and some EU states may push for parallel trade talks. October 2018 - Barnier\\'s target to finalise Withdrawal Treaty to give time for ratification by the European Parliament and a majority in the European Council by March 2019. Autumn 2018 to Spring 2019 - Just to make things complicated Scottish government wants independence vote once Brexit deal is clear. But May has so far rejected the call for a new Scottish referendum until after Britain leaves the EU. B-DAY March 30 2019 (tentative) - Britain leaves. At any rate it should do so two years after May writes. It happens to be a non-working day a Saturday. And avoids April Fool\\'s Day April 1. The date could be fine-tuned. Britain could leave earlier if it gets a deal and the two-year deadline can be extended if all agree. But Brussels wants Britain out before EU elections in May 2019. Despite mutual threats of no deal few want such chaos. A PERIOD OF TRANSITION May and EU leaders say transitional arrangements may well be needed to give more time to agree a future trade deal and give people and businesses time to adjust to the divorce. Many see another two to five years after Brexit for a final settlement. If Scotland votes for independence expect more years to negotiate its split from London and possible re-entry to the EU.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Theresa May\\'s Brexit letter to European Union President Donald Tusk will please EU leaders by sounding constructive and acknowledging Britain must settle obligations before leaving. But the prime minister also made some tougher demands. In the six-page document delivered today to the EU summit chair to trigger a two-year countdown to withdrawal she called for parallel negotiations on not just divorce terms but a new trade pact and special deals in key sectors. She also made a veiled threat on security cooperation if talks break down. \"We should engage with one another constructively and respectfully in a spirit of sincere cooperation\" May wrote. She referred -- twice -- to London\\'s \"obligations as a departing member state\" in a nod to Brussels\\' demands that a \"Brexit bill\" possibly of the order of 60 billion euros be paid to cover outstanding commitments before Britain leaves. She echoed the EU\\'s own language in acknowledging that there could be \"no cherry-picking\" to retain the best bits of EU membership and acknowledged that Britons doing business with the Union would have to abide by rules they no longer help to set. In response the other 27 governments said Britain could be a \"close partner\": \"We will approach these talks constructively and strive to find an agreement\" they said in a statement. Some of May\\'s demands however run counter to what at least some of them want setting up the kind of disagreements among the 27 that Britain may exploit despite Tusk\\'s call for unity.  EU negotiators say they want as far as possible to agree a withdrawal treaty if possible by the end of this year before opening negotiations on the free trade deal Britain wants. But May made clear her insistence trade talks should start now. \"We believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal\" she wrote. Practically EU officials acknowledge that elements of the withdrawal such as arrangements on the new UK-EU border and notably on the land frontier across the island of Ireland can not be settled without some idea of the future trade relations. But they want to resist getting too deeply into that until Britain has settled other issues including the bill but also how to treat the four million Europeans who will find themselves living as foreigners on either side of the new cross-Channel frontier -- something May agreed was a priority. AVOIDING THE \"CLIFF-EDGE\" May also suggests quickly opening \"technical talks\" on how to avoid disrupting key economic sectors that are closely intertwined mentioning finance and \"network industries\" a term for sectors with strong linkages to other ones. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said the EU would \\'take note\\' of the UK\\'s position. Video: Chris Sant Fournier EU negotiators determined to avoid giving Britain such a sweet deal that Brexit could encourage imitators want to avoid moving quickly to cutting special agreements on certain sectors -- though they acknowledge that is likely to happen eventually. May\\'s acknowledgment that two years is a tight schedule for negotiating all she wants will be welcomed in Brussels. She said it was likely that to avoid a disruptive \"cliff-edge\" of changed regulations any deal would need \"implementation periods\" beyond 2019. That echoes EU assumptions of a \"transition phase\". Also chiming with continental thinking at the risk of displeasing some of her own supporters at home May also said negotiations would have to look at how trade disputes would be settled. Escaping the jurisdiction of EU courts was a key demand of Brexit campaigners but the EU will insist that Britain be subject to some outside supervision if it wants free trade. One section of May\\'s letter echoing a passage of a speech on the Brexit proposals in January may hit a sour note. Though she did not repeat the same \"no deal is better than a bad deal\" language she explicitly referred to the possibility that Britain may leave on March 29 2019 \"without an agreement\". That she suggested would be fine in London because it could \"default\" to trading under World Trade Organisation rules. But she added it would weaken Britain\\'s cooperation against \"crime and terrorism\". When she said as much in January that was seen as an unwelcome threat -- if perhaps an empty one -- to deprive the EU of the undoubted prowess of British intelligence. Tusk\\'s response assured Britain of cooperation to ensure an \"orderly exit\". But he too offered a hard edge. Negotiations were about \"damage control\" he said. But in the end he and the EU negotiators would \"protect the interests of the 27\". \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Britain’s banks could cope with a “disorderly” Brexit without needing to curb lending or be bailed out by taxpayers the Bank of England said yesterday after carrying out its annual health check on lenders. For the first time since it started ‘stress-testing’ banks in 2014 none of Britain’s major lenders would need to raise extra capital the BOE said. The stress tests are primarily calculated on the basis of the amount of capital banks held at the start of 2017. Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland failed the test on this basis but do not need to raise extra capital now as they increased capital during the course of year. “The [BOE]... judges that the banking system can continue to support the real economy even in the unlikely event of a disorderly Brexit” governor Mark Carney said at a news conference. The results will come as a partial relief to Chancellor Philip Hammond who is looking to sell £3 billion of public holdings of RBS shares during the next financial year to help reduce public debt. HSBC Lloyds Banking Group Santander UK Standard Chartered and the Nationwide Building Society all passed the test without reservations. Britain’s economy has lost momentum this year as higher inflation – largely due to the fall in the pound after June 2016’s Brexit vote – eats into households’ disposable income. Last week government forecasters sharply downgraded their outlook for the next few years predicting annual growth of barely 1.5 per cent – almost a full percentage point below Britain’s historic trend. Britain is due to leave the EU in March 2019 and the BOE’s Financial Policy Committee reiterated that a “timely agreement” on an implementation period for transitional arrangements would reduce financial stability risks. However even if Britain crashed out of the EU the BOE said the latest stress test suggested banks were strong enough to cope as it published its half-yearly Financial Stability Report. Responding to the BOE announcement RBS said it continued to make progress towards being a “stress resilient” bank. Barclays noted that it did not need to raise fresh capital. The banking system can continue to support the real economy The BOE said British and EU lawmakers needed to pass new laws to ensure there was no disruption to £26 trillion worth of cross-border derivative contracts and £36 million insurance contracts held by EU and British policyholders. The BOE also said it was not clear if the banking system could cope easily with a disorderly Brexit if it came at the same time as a severe global recession and further substantial fines for financial misconduct at banks. The central bank said it was pressing on with plans to raise a risk buffer to one per cent from 0.5 per cent with binding effect from November 2018. This extra cushion was already covered by capital banks held in excess of the regulatory minimum. The BOE said it would consider in the first half of next year whether this buffer needed to be raised further. The one per cent rate of the counter-cyclical capital buffer corresponds with what the BOE views as a “standard” risk environment. Aside from Brexit Britain faced “material” risks from global debt levels asset valuations and misconduct. Domestic consumer credit growth represented a “pocket of risk” the BOE said echoing language used before. But it added that borrowing was not that high relative to income. Britain’s current account deficit – which government forecasters expect to exceed four per cent of GDP for the foreseeable future – was also a material risk the BOE said. Investors’ appetite for British assets could slump if the growth outlook darkened or there was a loss of confidence in British economic policy or its openness to trade and investment the BOE said. “Such a disruption could... drive further sterling depreciation potentially triggering a build-up in inflationary pressures and lead to a downward adjustment in domestic demand” the BOE said. The central bank said it would set out its policy for approving EU banks to operate in Britain by the end of the year. Separately it is urging banks to consider long-term risks to their business models from new financial technology and slow economic growth. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The move by the commission which said serious breaches of the law had been committed by Vote Leave added to calls from opponents of Brexit for a re-run of the referendum on European Union membership though Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out another vote. Two years since voting by 52 percent to 48 percent to leave the bloc the United Kingdom its political and business leaders remain deeply divided over the country\\'s plans for departing from the EU on March 29 2019. The commission said Vote Leave which was fronted by leading Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson who resigned as foreign secretary last week and Michael Gove now environment minister used an allied group to pay Aggregate IQ a company which used social media data to target voters and thus exceeded spending. \"We found substantial evidence that the two groups worked to a common plan did not declare their joint working and did not adhere to the legal spending limits\" said Bob Posner the commission\\'s director of political finance and regulation. Brexit campaigners say they are fighting an attempt by the British establishment to thwart the process of leaving the EU and have repeatedly dismissed as nonsense claims by opponents that they cheated lied and even colluded with Russia to win. Vote Leave said the Electoral Commision had made false accusations failed to interview anybody from the group and were politically-motivated. \"Having skimmed the (commission\\'s) report they\\'ve ignored (Vote Leave\\'s) detailed evidence so it\\'s riddled with errors & conclusions completely wrong\" Matthew Elliott who was head of the group said on Twitter. \"We accepted their invitation for an interview in early March. Senior staff also volunteered to be interviewed. They haven\\'t followed due process.\" Overall Vote Leave was found to have exceeded the statutory spending limit of seven million pounds by 449079 pounds by working with BeLeave which spent 675000 pounds with Aggregate IQ under a common plan with Vote Leave. The commission said Vote Leave should have declared its joint spending and added that its spending return was inaccurate in respect of 43 items of spending totalling 236501 pounds. David Halsall the responsible person for Vote Leave and Darren Grimes the founder of the BeLeave campaign group were referred to the police for false declarations of campaign spending. Grimes said he was shocked and disappointed by the commission\\'s decision adding that he did nothing wrong. Vote Leave resisted the investigation from the start and had refused to cooperate the commission said. \"Nevertheless the evidence we have found is clear and substantial\" Posner said. \"These are serious breaches of the laws put in place by parliament to ensure fairness and transparency at elections and referendums.\" In the June 23 2016 referendum 17.4 million people or 51.9 percent of votes cast supported leaving the EU while 16.1 million people or 48.1 percent of the votes supported staying in the EU. \"With new facts arising every week ... we know their claims turned out to be fantasy but we now know they cheated too\" opposition lawmaker Chuka Umunna told parliament after demanding an urgent response from the government. \"We cannot say with confidence that this foul play did not impact on the result.\" May\\'s spokesman said on Monday there would be no second referendum after a former British minister Justine Greening called for another vote to solve a parliamentary stalemate on Brexit. \"We are very clear that this was a legitimate democratic exercise in which the public delivered its opinion and that is what we\\'re going to be delivering on\" May\\'s spokesman told reporters on Tuesday. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s opposition Labour Party prefers a new election to a second referendum on Brexit its leader said on Sunday heaping pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May whose plans for a divorce deal with the European Union have hit an impasse. Labour\\'s Jeremy Corbyn has so far resisted calls to back a \"People\\'s Vote\" or new referendum on the decision to quit the EU. But the political landscape has changed since May was ambushed by the EU on Thursday over her plans for Brexit - the biggest shift in British policy for almost half a century. With talk of a new election swirling after May\\'s \"Chequers\" plan was all but shredded at an EU summit in Austria last week and chances of Britain exiting the bloc without a deal rising Labour is under pressure to start setting the Brexit agenda. Corbyn a veteran eurosceptic who in 1975 voted \"No\" to Britain\\'s membership of the then-European Community said that while he would listen to a debate about any possible second vote on Britain\\'s membership he preferred a snap election if May failed to get a deal that Labour could support in parliament. \"Our preference would be for a general election and we can then negotiate our future relationship with Europe but let\\'s see what comes out of conference\" he told the BBC\\'s Andrew Marr Show saying Labour was ready to vote against any deal. \"We would vote it down if it didn\\'t meet our tests in order to send the government if it is still in office straight back to the negotiating table and if there is a general election and we are in office we would go straight to the negotiating table.\" Britain is to exit the EU in March next year. After weeks of both sides making positive noises about prospects of clinching a divorce deal and future trading relationship the mood music turned sour on Thursday in Salzburg Austria when the bloc\\'s leaders one by one came out to rubbish May\\'s Chequers plans. A tacit agreement to try to offer her some support before she heads to what is going to be a difficult annual conference of her governing Conservative Party later this month was broken by some British diplomatic missteps. New election? May has vowed to hold her nerve in the talks pressing the EU to come up with an alternative proposal to her Chequers plan named after her country residence where a deal was hashed out with her top ministers in July. But the impasse with the EU has prompted some to predict an early election with local media reporting that May\\'s team has begun contingency planning for a snap vote in November to save both Brexit and her job. Brexit minister Dominic Raab again ruled out any new election later this year describing the suggestion as being \"for the birds\". He said Britain would not \"flit from plan to plan like some sort of diplomatic butterfly\". \"We are going to be resolute about this\" Raab added. While saying she will stick to her guns May might have little chance but to change tack after a party conference where the deep divisions over Europe that have riven her Conservatives for decades will be plain for all to see. A senior pro-EU Conservative lawmaker Nicky Morgan said May would have to give ground on trade and customs arrangements to overcome the biggest obstacle to a withdrawal accord - the prevention of a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and Ireland a member of the EU. \"I am not sure there is life left in Chequers\" Morgan chair of parliament\\'s Treasury Select Committee and a former cabinet minister under May\\'s predecessor told Sky News. \"We want to see a deal. The question I think that has to be answered now by the government by the EU leaders is what room for movement is there how do we move on from where we ended up last week?\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British MPs voted to reject a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday prompting Prime Minister Theresa May to announce she will put her EU divorce plan to parliament for a third time in the coming days. May warned that if MPs did not adopt the deal there could have to be a lengthy delay to Brexit that would see Britain elect members to the European Parliament in elections in May. She was speaking after MPs voted to rule out a \"no deal\" departure on March 29 -- two days after they also rejected her own divorce terms. The chaotic session of parliament demonstrated once again the splits in parliament over Brexit reflecting the deep divisions that remain in Britain almost three years after the 2016 referendum vote. Addressing the House of Commons May said the \"logical consequence\" of the votes was for MPs now to decide if they wanted to postpone Brexit. But she said the EU would only support a short delay if MPs \\xa0agreed her deal -- without that \"there will need to be a much longer extension\". In such a scenario she said Britain may have to hold European Parliament elections in May. \"I do not think that would be the right outcome. But the house needs to face up to the consequences of the decisions it has taken\" she said. - Staring down the precipice -The no-deal vote was largely symbolic as Britain is still on course to leave the EU in just over two weeks unless it can agree a new plan or delay which would require the unanimous consent of all EU leaders. MPs on Tuesday rejected May\\'s deal for a second time raising the risk of severing 46 years of UK-EU ties overnight and causing an economic shock on both sides of the Channel. Catherine McGuinness policy chief for the City of London financial district said British business was \"staring down the precipice\". The impasse in London has also caused huge frustration in Brussels and EU leaders have now warned they cannot agree a delay until MPs say what they want. \"Why would we prolong the negotiation? To do what?\" EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier told the European Parliament in Strasbourg ahead of the vote in London. May\\'s decision to bring back a deal that critics said was \"dead\" is likely to prompt fury among many MPs. But a spokeswoman for the European Commission said: \"There are only two ways to leave the EU: with or without a deal. The EU is prepared for both. \"We have agreed a deal with the prime minister and the EU is ready to sign it.\" - Delay to June 30? -The \"no deal\" vote emphasised May\\'s lack of control over events. She had offered MPs a vote against a \"no deal\" option after they rejected her plan on Tuesday but her proposal made clear this remained the default option. MPs opted to instead back an amendment ruling out \"no deal\" in all circumstances. The pound took a brief knock after MPs rejected May\\'s divorce deal for a second time on Tuesday but rallied on hopes that MPs would now vote for a delay. The government motion for Thursday\\'s vote said that if MPs backed May\\'s Brexit deal in a third vote before March 20 -- the day before an EU summit -- then she will ask for a short extension to allow for the treaty to be ratified. This will last until June 30. \"If it (parliament) is not willing to support a deal in the coming days and as it is not willing to support leaving without a deal on 29 March then it is suggesting that there will need to be a much longer extension\" May said. Speaking ahead of the vote German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: \"Achieving an orderly exit together and I particularly want to repeat this today remains in our mutual interest.\" French President Emmanuel Macron also warned again that the deal on the table was \"not negotiable\". \"We cannot renegotiate an accord that we negotiated over several months and which we have said is not renegotiable\" he said. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

With Britain\\'s political world in chaos over Brexit Christians across the country this weekend are taking part in special prayer sessions hoping for some divine help in healing bitter Brexit divisions. \"It doesn\\'t matter whether you voted leave or remain we\\'re still one humanity one nation\" Stephen Cottrell Bishop of Chelmsford told AFP after imploring his congregation to heal the rift. The Church of England has promoted the initiative as \"tea and prayer drop-ins\" -- combining two of its most well-known sources of comfort. Despite a sharp decline in church attendance Cottrell believes faith still has the power to unite the country after Brexit. \"It\\'s no good the church standing on the sidelines waving our hands saying \\'why doesn\\'t everybody just love each other\\' what we\\'ve got to do is show what that love looks like in action\" he said.\\xa0 Worshipper Angela Sadler 65 said the church needed to play a larger role in helping resolve the broader issues surrounding the crisis. \"It\\'s quite difficult for the church because the church needs to be seen as a non-political body which is correct but I also think... we need to see more of God\\'s love\" she said. As sunlight flooded through the ornate stained glass windows of Chelmsford Cathedral Cottrell told the group of around 20 worshippers that the values of the church could be expressed through a return to \"British values\" that were \"rooted in the Christian tradition\".\\xa0 \"Those British values of care for the underdog care for the stranger tolerance.\" - \\'Prayer is so important\\' -As the floor was opened to parishioners one woman called for help in being \"patient\" something she was struggling with in the inescapable and ever-growing crisis. Another echoed the bishop\\'s call for a return to \"traditional values\" although the definition of what those values are is one of many debates swirling around Brexit highlighting the challenges in uniting the country around a common message. \"It\\'s going to be a long process there\\'s no easy solution to unity\" said Sadler\\'s husband Stuart 66. Three years from a hugely divisive referendum over Britain\\'s EU membership in which the Leave vote won by 52 percent Anglican leaders have called for communities across the country \"to join together in conversation and prayer\". The result in Chelmsford was about the same as the national average with Leave winning by 52.8 percent. Angela Stuart said she felt \"compelled\" to come to the service \"to stand amongst others that believe the same\".\\xa0 \"We are a great nation and we do need the Lord in this nation and prayer is so important in bringing that forward\" she said. A recent survey found that around four in 10 British adults have been left feeling powerless angry or worried by Brexit exposing the mental toll being taken on citizens. - Without faith it\\'s impossible -The early-morning service began with a reading of the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector from Luke\\'s gospel chosen as a warning against the divisiveness of moral hubris. \"For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted\" the parable ends. \"The reading is about how we define ourselves we\\'ve got to stop defining ourselves by whether we voted leave or remain\" said Cottrell who also sits in the parliament\\'s House of Lords. \"We have to define ourselves by our common humanity... by recognising the presence of God in each other.\" Retired policeman David Gilbey 56 said this could only be achieved through faith recalling a Bible passage in which Jesus tells his followers to be united saying: \"be one just as I am one with my Father\".\\xa0 \"Unless we have that unity with our heavenly Father we haven\\'t got anything to grip onto\" he warned.\\xa0 \"Everything is slipping and sliding these days there is no common anchor point.\"\\xa0 \\xa0 Mueller report to be released by mid-April: attorney general Government critic elected Slovakia\\'s first female president \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

There is some good news about Brexit. The magic eye picture of Britain’s policy is beginning to emerge from the random pixels of the referendum campaign’s promises and threats to a shadowy image of compromise. But there are three problems: parliament is looking at the picture from a different angle to the government; the picture is still more of a blur than a portrait; and time is running out fast. In parliament on April 1 the speaker – in the face of some criticism from Brexiteers – made the day’s proceedings a floorshow for the resistance. MPs were to undertake a second round of indicative votes to show which options they would support. Conservative backbencher Kenneth Clarke sought a customs union; his colleague Nick Boles proposed the “Common Market 2.0” which effectively amounted to staying in the single market. Two more options proposed another referendum and stopping the whole Brexit process if there is no deal.\\xa0Clarke’s customs union proposal lost by just three votes All four options failed to attract majority support. But each lost by smaller margins than when they were last voted on the week previously. Clarke’s customs union proposal lost by just three votes. We have learned that the idea of a softer Brexit is measurably more popular in the House Commons than leaving without a deal or the prime minister’s deal (when one considers that cabinet ministers were not able to vote on April 1). Next the cabinet met for eight hours on April 2 amid reports of deep splits many made evident in public statements. Justice secretary David Gauke urged the prime minister to follow parliament’s lead towards a customs union while treasury secretary Liz Truss told the Today programme that “no deal” was still on the table.\\xa0That might suggest conceding a customs union but not single market alignment. The collective conclusion after this marathon meeting was that May must meet opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to try to hammer out a common position to present to parliament. This is as close as the PM has come to a government of national unity which others have said may be necessary. Meanwhile May will seek an extension to the extension of the UK’s departure from the EU but not one so long as to embroil the country in EU parliament elections. What are the portents for success? The optimist sees that May is under increasing pressure from parliament and from some cabinet colleagues to cut a deal using Labour’s support. That might suggest conceding a customs union but not single market alignment. This would just about secure the only positive entry in the British history books still possible for May – Brexit with a deal. The doubters can point to the fact that no modification of the prime minister’s plan has gained a parliamentary majority and several cabinet ministers have threatened to resign if any is granted. May and Corbyn have met several times without any substantial policy outcome and neither is a noted pragmatist. May is already touting fallback strategies for more parliamentary votes if the talks fail. Meanwhile EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is talking up the prospect of no deal while French president Emanuel Macron is losing patience with the British in public. May could still take most of her party with her if she acts with skill. This makes her job easier than that of Robert Peel the founder of the Conservatives with whom she has been compared because of the way he split the Tories to end the Corn Laws. On the other hand Peel was distinctive in being prepared to end his career by handing credit and power to his political opponents in the national interest while he walked into the wilderness. Whether that is true of May will be the test of her premiership.

After months of disagreement and a historic defeat in parliament MPs have finally given Theresa May a lifeline in what is being hailed as a “mandate” to go back to Europe and renegotiate the Brexit withdrawal agreement. Even the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to enter talks with the prime minister to set out his party’s position. He has previously been hesitant to do so and it should be noted was initially ignored by Number 10. However while things are looking a little brighter for May in relation to her party and parliament when it comes to the European front it really seems that nothing has changed. What has been remarkable to witness during this process is how predicted problems have regularly been dismissed as “project fear” right up until the narrative changes and they become “what people voted for”. This was supposed to be “the easiest thing in human history’” and the UK was certain to “have its cake and eat it”. Now as the deadline looms hardline Brexit supporters argue that a no-deal exit is actually what people should want if they seek true freedom from the European Union. And while most of the opposition to the current deal is ostensibly over the issue of the Irish backstop Leave campaigners were once to be found dismissing any concerns about the dangers of returning to a hard border in Ireland as nonsense. Parliament giving May its backing to march into Brussels and demand a better deal mainly with regards to the backstop while heralded as a major achievement and a boost to her negotiating power in reality doesn’t improve her position all that much. Far from taking a no-deal scenario off the table parliament has merely signalled that a majority of MPs would rather it didn’t happen. Meanwhile they’ve also made it quite clear that they don’t agree on what they would prefer nor do they know how best to go about it. It is also hard to see how parliament voting in favour of something that the EU has repeatedly said cannot and will not happen changes anything. While many Brexit-supporting MPs such as Dominc Raab have suggested this last-minute show of unity strengthens the UK’s hand it is hard to see how. Parliament has finally with less than two months to go before the UK leaves the European Union agreed on something and appears to be behind the prime minister; but this potentially fragile unity is nothing compared to the strong unity that has been constantly displayed by the European Union. The other EU nations agreed to a position shortly after the 2016 referendum and have stuck to it since. Comments from leading European figures after the vote in parliament suggest no reason to believe that this has changed. Suggesting that this puts pressure on the EU to give the UK concessions or face it leaving on World Trade Organisation terms still shows an inability to grasp the main issues that the EU believes are at stake. The UK leaving without a deal and the economic fallout from this for both sides is of course not preferable to the EU but as has been written before the integrity of the single market and the stability of the EU is of primary importance to the remaining member states. The UK effectively threatening to shoot itself in the foot really provides no incentive for the EU to budge. Corbyn’s agreement to meet with the prime minister is however potentially significant. The hard-Brexit supporters within her party are unlikely to be happy with any deal she puts forward. While Boris Johnson recently suggested that this could change others have signalled the complete opposite. Sadly it seems that many don’t really care what happens as long as the UK leaves and they don’t get the blame for any of the negative effects that might be felt. If May can convince Corbyn to support some form of her deal backing from the Labour Party could help her mitigate her slim majority and the deep divisions that run in her party and get some version of her deal through parliament. Depending on Labour’s position this could in theory lead to support for a softer Brexit but again it is not up to them it is up to the EU. Regardless of what MPs agree to in parliament it is almost irrelevant in the European context if the EU refuses to budge on its position. Unless something dramatic changes on the continent the options really are deal – perhaps with the promise of some assurances here and there – or no deal. To suggest that this is just the EU playing hardball and that it will crack at the 11th hour is wishful thinking. Even if there was a chance for a better deal with less than two months to go the time to negotiate it has long passed. The EU refusing to renegotiate now is not intransigence it is consistency and determination in the face of continued hubris and a lack of understanding on the part of the UK.

The stakes could hardly be higher as the clock ticks down to the moment the world\\'s fifth-biggest economy splits from its main trading partner on March 29. May and the other 27 EU leaders agreed on a draft agreement in November designed to keep the process as orderly and damage free as possible. The accord took nearly two years to negotiate but has managed to upset just about everyone in British politics. May survived her party\\'s resulting leadership no-confidence motion but was forced to abort a December vote on the pact in parliament after admitting it would lose by a \"significant margin\". There are few signs that much has changed since. May returned empty handed from a subsequent EU summit in December which she had hoped could address the concerns of her disgruntled Northern Irish coalition partners. Brexit-backing MPs in her Conservative party are still in open revolt while opposition Labour leaders are angling for new elections. Vote to go ahead The BBC reported Monday that the Brexit deal vote in parliament is now set for January 15.\\xa0 Downing Street declined to confirm the date but May insisted Sunday that it would not be delayed again.\\xa0 The formal debate kicks off in parliament on Wednesday. May warned Sunday the deal\\'s defeat would put Britain \"in uncharted territory (in which) I don\\'t think anybody can say exactly what will happen\". London has been swirling with rumours about how exactly May intends to avoid Britain crashing out of the bloc without any trade or other arrangements in place - something a large chunk of MPs oppose. The prime minister received a cross-party letter Sunday from 209 lawmakers urging her \"to agree a mechanism that would ensure a \\'no-deal\\' Brexit could not take place\".\\xa0 One tactic touted by advisers to force May\\'s deal through parliament would see the government re-introducing more or less the same version of the draft over and over again. \"If we have to have the vote 30 times we will\" a Downing Street source told BuzzFeed News. May refused to rule out the possibility of a second or third vote when pressed about it in the BBC interview Sunday. May will meet her party\\'s MPs over private drinks on Monday and Wednesday in an attempt to sway waverers. The arm twisting will be accompanied by a new government campaign designed to prepare Britons for the full impact of a disruptive no-deal scenario. One test on Monday will see dozens of trucks taking over a disused airport earmarked as a future lorry park and then driven down a highway to the Channel port of Dover to assess how the infrastructure can cope. Dover handles most of Britain\\'s trade with Europe and is expected to get quickly clogged \\xa0up if no customs arrangements are made. The pro-Brexit former foreign secretary Boris Johnson claimed in Monday\\'s Daily Telegraph that leaving without an agreement is actually \"closest to what people voted for\". Involving parliament May outlined a formal plan of action Sunday that included the possibility of giving parliament a bigger say in a new round of trade talks with Brussels due to start immediately after March 29. \"There\\'s a number of ways which we\\'re looking to see how we can involve parliament in a greater way in the future\" she said. These negotiations will also try to resolve the prickly issue of keeping the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic open while preserving the integrity of the EU\\'s single market. The temporary solution laid out in the draft withdrawal agreement does not suit Northern Ireland\\'s tiny Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) that props up May\\'s government. Nigel Dodds MP its deputy leader said Sunday the party had seen no tangible change in the proposal since December. \"The backstop remains the poison which makes any vote for the withdrawal agreement so toxic\" he added. The DUP wants a binding guarantee from Brussels that Northern Ireland\\'s trade with the rest of Britain will not be subjected to any types of checks. May spent part of her holidays ringing up EU leaders about possible concessions. Brussels has made clear it will cede nothing before the vote. The prime minister told the BBC she would continue to seek \"further assurances from the European Union\" about the border issue ahead of the vote. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Prime Minister Theresa May wants to make Britain a global leader in trade after Brexit but former negotiators say the country faces a long slog despite warm words from some world leaders over forging new relationships. With other countries reluctant to get involved in detailed discussions until Britain’s future ties with the European Union are clear and a lack of negotiators in London ready to begin talks any firm deals could be years away. While the government says it can do the groundwork Britain cannot formally sign trade agreements until it leaves the EU and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has said EU Member States should not even negotiate deals while still part of the bloc. “Nobody with any sense from China the US Brazil or wherever is going to engage with the UK other than a friendly drink in the bar until the UK has a regime with the EU” retired British trade negotiator Roderick Abbott told Reuters. “That gives them the yardstick against which you negotiate” said Abbott who during his more than 40-year career worked on trade for the British government the European Commission and the World Trade Organisation. May and her team strike an optimistic tone highlighting nations that have said they are keen to do deals. But behind the scenes countries are pragmatic. A senior diplomat from a deve\\xadloped country with which Britain has suggested negotiating a deal said the EU was a more important partner so any deal with Britain would depend on how it affected his country’s trade with the EU. “They want to talk to us. We’re always happy to talk trade. But frankly there isn’t much we can seriously talk about in detail which is really what trade deals are all about until we know what their relationship will be with the EU” he said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject. Japan has expressed concern over uncertainty surrounding Britain’s future EU relationship including its access to the bloc’s single market while US President Barack Obama quashed the prospect of a fast-track deal. Australia said last Tuesday that it would focus on pursuing a free trade agreement with the EU while it waited for Britain to be able to negotiate formally. According to government figures Britain’s total trade exports for June were worth £24.9 billion (€29.48 billion) with the US its biggest export market by value. The government has said three million British jobs are linked to trade with the EU while the EU estimates a further 3.9 million in Britain are supported by EU exports to the rest of the world. Certainly the UK is going to need a free trade deal more than the other side May has promised to deliver Brexit after 52 per cent of Britons backed leaving the EU at the June 23 referendum. But she has also said she will not trigger Article 50 beginning the formal two-year divorce process this year in order to allow the government time to prepare. While Article 50 refers to “taking account” of the departing country’s future relationship with the EU many say detailed talks will have to wait until Britain has left meaning it could be 2019 before substantial trade negotiations begin. “It is after Brexit that the UK would formally negotiate with the EU new arrangements on its relationship such as trade participation in the single market and movement of labour” Jean-Claude Piris former head of the legal service of the Council of the European Union wrote in the Financial Times. Britain’s Brexit minister David Davis said last Monday it was nonsense to say that the negotiations could not run in parallel. With a British election due in 2020 May could feel under pressure to get deals done. At her first international summit last week she said Australia India Mexico Singapore China and South Korea had all welcomed talks about post-Brexit trade. For now the work of Britain’s new Department for International Trade will likely be largely focused on diplomacy and crucially amassing a team of experts after decades of relying on the EU to negotiate its trade deals. Before the department was crea\\xadted then business minister Sajid Javid said he wanted to have 300 experts in place this year up from around 40. A spokeswoman for the trade department said it would not give a running commentary on recruitment. Negotiators say there are usually teams of 20-25 in the room for talks and many more involved in support and preparation. Deals involving detail on thousands of goods take years to agree and Britain will want to pursue several simultaneously. “We are going to be very short of capacity” said Alan Winters director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex in southern England. Options include hiring experts from law firms banks or consultancies something that is likely to prove expensive. Then there are the Britons who work in the EU’s trade directorate although according to the European Commission website only 32 of the directorate’s 596 staff are British. The government has also talked of using foreign negotiators and Commonwealth allies such as Australia have offered to loan experts. But Britain has also been clear negotiators would not be involved in talks with their own home nations. “Are we going to see cohorts of Australians Canadians and Japanese walking in to Whitehall to carry on our international trade negotiations for us? Of course we’re not” former UK government trade negotiator Michael Johnson told Reuters. “With the prospects so uncertain I don’t see many other admi\\xadnistrations being prepared to second people. So we’d better train up you’d better have some pretty intensive crash training programmes for indigenous Britons.” Keen to secure its first post-Brexit trade deal Britain will be negotiating from a position of rela\\xadtive weakness say trade experts. “Certainly the UK is going to need a free trade deal more than the other side because the UK market isn’t going to be as attractive as the EU one used to be” said former negotiator Abbott. One of its biggest challenges will be incorporating a substantial agreement on services – around 80 per cent of Britain’s economy – as trade deals tend to be more focussed on goods. The EU’s recently concluded deal with Canada only included limited provision for services and maintains some restrictions over financial services access a crucial area for Britain. “Services is just technically more complicated just very very difficult to work out what the value is how much is it worth that you change your regulation a bit?” said Winters adding that regulators would likely need to be involved in talks. “It is going to be a major issue for Britain. These are frictions they are not always complete barriers they just become a matter of extra cost but in a competitive world even a bit of extra cost is a big problem.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: PA  A second Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom could “not be ruled out” former foreign minister George Vella said. Dr Vella was speaking to the Times of Malta after it was announced that Brexit Secretary David Davis had resigned. His decision caused mayhem for Prime Minister Theresa May as foreign secretary Boris Johnson also quit his post later in the day over the plans to leave the European Union. “In politics you can never rule out something definitively” Dr Vella said when asked about a second Brexit referendum. “It seems that there has been a change of heart in the UK population on Brexit” he added. European Council President Donald Tusk on social media raised the idea that Brexit might be called off after Mr Johnson a campaigner for Britain to leave the EU quit the Cabinet. Echoing a comment he had made to reporters after the resignation of Mr Davis Mr Tusk tweeted: “Politicians come and go but the problems they have created for people remain. I can only regret that the idea of Brexit has not left with Mr Davis and Mr Johnson. But... who knows?” However former foreign minister Tonio Borg said that he had doubts about whether there would be a second referendum. “It is important to note that referendums in the UK are quite uncommon” Dr Borg said. Dr Vella and Dr Borg both agreed there were several question marks being raised around Brexit and Ms May’s prospects as Prime Minister. “We need to wait and see” Dr Borg told the Times of Malta adding pressure for Ms May to leave continued to mount with the questions over her leadership. A crisis in the UK government was “quickly forming” he noted. Negotiations between the UK and the EU had “an uncertain future” Dr Vella said. There was still an unclear sense of what the UK wanted its relationship with the European Union to be after Brexit. “It is certain that Theresa May will not be taken very seriously by the EU” Dr Vella said. “She wanted to stay in the EU but she took on Brexit because she had to as prime minister. “They have to negotiate with [the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator] Michel Barnier a very assiduous and methodical man” Dr Vella said adding that Mr Barnier will “work hard to get his way”. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  As hedge fund manager Buford Scott sat at home watching the TV in shock as it emerged Britain had voted to leave the European Union his computer-based trading models were quietly boosting his business by 1.5 percent. Scott\\'s algorithm-driven fund and others like it beat hedge funds run by humans on Brexit night not because the computers had correctly predicted the results of the June 23 referendum but because they followed trends already in place. Computer-driven funds placed bets on safe-haven assets like the yen and gold which had performed well in the six months leading up to the vote against riskier currencies like the Mexican peso - a play yielding a more than 7 per cent return on June 24. Hedge funds on average were down 0.18 per cent on the day of June 24 while trend-following machine-based strategies gained 0.71 per cent according to data from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research. Some of the biggest hedge funds\\' computer-run strategies - also known as systematic or quantitative - made huge gains in the aftermath of the vote for Brexit. British systematic firm Winton Capital which manages more than $30 billion made a gain of 3.1 per cent on June 24 while Greenwich Connecticut-based AQR\\'s $13.3 billion computer strategy returned 5.2 per cent - about $700 million. Polls had shown the Leave and Remain camps neck-and-neck before the referendum. But partly on the view that undecided voters tend to opt for the status quo bookmakers and betting exchanges had largely predicted Remain would win comfortably. Most players in financial markets agreed. \"Almost no one was betting on the actual outcome of Brexit\" said GAM portfolio manager Anthony Lawler in London a hedge fund investor whose firm recently bought systematic investment manager Cantab Capital Partners which made 4.1 percent in the year to June 27. \"Man chose to reduce risk given the unknown. Machines chose to be long safe-haven assets because that trend was already in place. Machines won.\" This does not necessarily mean machines would tend to outperform during big global events - a Remain vote might well have seen humans come out top - or during unexpected twists. Machine models were down 2.42 per cent in 2015 while hedge funds on average were down 1.12 per cent according to HFR. But in this case machines fared better because with no preconceived ideas about the result they followed the same strategies as previously strategies which a Leave vote happened to favour. The few non-systematic hedge fund managers who did make money in the immediate referendum aftermath were highly contrarian such as Crispin Odey a Brexit backer who made 15 percent by betting his $10.2 billion fund\\'s assets on a fall in financial markets and a surge in safe-haven gold. RISK ENVIRONMENT Scott the managing partner of Stelrox Capital who was watching the referendum from his study in Wimbledon south-west London said his models had put on a small short sterling position which brought some profit - the pound tumbled as much as 12 per cent on June 24 to a 31-year low. But it was his short positions on emerging currencies like the South African rand and Mexican peso which also dived as investors fled to safety and his longs on the low-risk dollar and yen that brought the biggest return. \"The risk environment was obviously high ... we hope we design our models so that these big unexpected events are catered for and we do that by diversifying across scores of currency pairs.\" he said. \"I was watching TV and had my computer screens up in the same room so I could watch it all.\" While Scott let his model run without interference some fund managers intervened to tweak their machine strategies in the run-up to the vote reducing the size of their trading positions to protect themselves from big adverse market swings. Demand for trend-following computer strategies is growing with such funds seeing inflows of $7.3 billion in investor money in the first six months of 2016 industry tracker Eurekahedge told Reuters. While there is no direct data comparison for the first half the overall hedge fund industry saw outflows of $15.1 billion in the first quarter according to HFR. \"Investors are turning to alternatives including quantitative strategies\" said Christopher Palazzolo principal at AQR Capital Management Europe. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters  As Britain prepares to negotiate its EU departure a number of banks are likely to decide within two months where to set up new continental bases to make sure they can keep serving clients in the bloc after Brexit. The European Central Bank said it will host a meeting of banks on May 4 at its offices in Frankfurt. It will spell out in detail what those moving some of their operations out of London must do to apply successfully for a licence. Talks with financial authorities have been under way for several months but the banks are expected to make up their minds imminently on where to move staff and operations. “We are in the hot phase. In the next six to eight weeks there will be a series of decisions” Felix Hufeld head of Germany’s Bafin financial regulator said. Ireland’s central bank will hold a similar gathering next month to advise groups considering a move to Dublin which along with Frankfurt Paris and other centres is competing to offer the banks a second base that remains in the European Union. A spokeswoman for the Irish central bank added that it had regular contact with the industry concerning “the potential consequences of Brexit”. Authorities expect potentially dozens of international banking groups currently operating their eurozone business out of London to move some operations and staff to the 19-member eurozone. They are likely to shift several thousand staff out of London as banks based in Europe’s biggest financial centre will lose automatic “passporting” rights to sell services across the EU when Britain is no longer a member state. Bankers also say Frankfurt is set to win the most business following a discreet but concerted German campaign to promote the financial centre of Europe’s biggest economy. We are in the hot phase. In the next six to eight weeks there will be a series of decisions German politicians have been reluctant to lobby publicly for big global banks to move to the country. Federal elections will be held in September and some voters remain suspicious of the financial industry after several German banks were forced to seek taxpayer-funded bailouts during the global crisis. However they have held a series of meetings with bank executives. Finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and politicians from the state of Hesse home to Frankfurt have met Wall Street powerbrokers in the US and Germany in recent months according to several sources familiar with the matter. As far back as October Schaeuble met Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein in Berlin and discussed its post-Brexit plans according to two sources familiar with the matter. Goldman Sachs is considering moving some operations to Frankfurt. James Gorman the chief executive of one of the world’s biggest banks Morgan Stanley recently visited Frankfurt where he met local regulators. Morgan Stanley intends to move jobs from London to cities such as Frankfurt people involved in the process have said. France is still pushing for banks to move to Paris and HSBC has a big presence in the city. But many of its peers are reluctant to move to the city where rents are high and they would face a special tax on wages in the financial sector. Last month Prime Minister Theresa May formally declared Britain’s intention to leave the EU opening a two-year period for both side to negotiate the divorce. Talks are expected to begin in June although May’s surprise calling of an election for June 8 has added to the uncertainty. Given the tight Brexit timetable bankers are keen to get cracking. The ECB which takes the final decision on granting a bank licence has said they should allow at least six months to get one. However Barclays chief executive Jes Staley said this week that obtaining a licence to trade on the continent and changing financial contracts to another jurisdiction takes a year to 18 months. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May urged the European Union on Monday not to allow a stand-off with the European Union over the so-called Irish backstop to derail the Brexit talks saying she believed a deal was achievable. In a statement to parliament before she heads to Brussels for a crucial summit on Wednesday May was upbeat about the chances of a deal with the EU but repeated that she would not agree to anything that could split Britain. She said she had been clear in negotiations to leave the European Union that a future trading relationship had to be linked to a divorce deal to avoid Britain being left \"in limbo\". In parliament May also told lawmakers an enhanced Canada-style deal supported by some eurosceptics in her Conservative Party was not on offer for the whole of the United Kingdom and that when Britain left the EU it would be as a whole country. However less than six months before Britain leaves the bloc May is under mounting pressure to change her strategy after talks with the EU were paused at the weekend when the two sides failed to agree on how to deal with the UK\\'s only land border with the EU. The problem of how to prevent the return of a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland has become the biggest hurdle to a deal on Brexit Britain\\'s biggest shift in policy for more than 40 years and has increased the possibility of Britain leaving without a deal. \"It is frustrating that almost all the remaining points of disagreement are focused on how we manage a scenario which both sides hope should never come to pass and which if it does would only be temporary\" May said. \"OUTCOME THAT NO-ONE WANTS\" \"We cannot let this disagreement derail the prospects of a good deal and leave us with a \\'no-deal\\' outcome that no-one wants\" she told a rowdy session of parliament. May tried to lead lawmakers many of whom have criticised not only her Brexit plans but also her negotiating strategy through the difficulties of what happened in Brussels after her Brexit minister raced there for talks on Sunday. She said the EU had stuck to its proposal of keeping Northern Ireland in the EU customs union if a UK-wide plan is not ready to be put in place after a transitional arrangement runs out at the end of 2020. But for May who has said repeatedly that she will not countenance the breakup of the United Kingdom any suggestion that Northern Ireland could be treated differently to the rest of Britain was unacceptable. \"As I have said many times I could never accept that no matter how unlikely such a scenario may be\" she said. \"So it must be the case first that the backstop should not need to come into force.\" But May still faces a struggle to ease the concerns of not only the EU but of her Conservative Party and her partners in parliament Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). TAKING LONGER Eurosceptics in her party fear that a backstop could keep Britain indefinitely in the bloc\\'s customs union while the DUP says it can never accept anything that splits Northern Ireland from the rest of Britain even going so far as to say it would withdraw the support in parliament upon which May relies. There has been little success so far in narrowing that gap and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said any deal would now \"take a bit more time than many people had hoped\". German Chancellor Angela Merkel also said she had been \"very hopeful\" that a deal on Britain\\'s exit could be achieved but \"at the moment it actually looks a bit more difficult\". A spokesman for May held out hope saying there were \"a number of means of achieving what we want to achieve\" on the backstop. He declined to give details and repeated Britain\\'s view that any such arrangement would be time-limited. \"I need to be able to look the British people in the eye and say this backstop is a temporary solution\" May told parliament. \"This is the time for cool calm heads to prevail. And it is the time for a clear-eyed focus on the few remaining but critical issues that are still to be agreed.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May assured EU leaders in Brussels that she can still reach a Brexit deal avoiding a showdown over stalled talks as Brussels stepped up planning for a failure of negotiations. May was given a 15-minute slot to speak to the bloc\\'s other 27 leaders before they sat down to dinner without her and discussed preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit under which Britain leaves the European Union without a treaty to cushion the disruption to businesses across the continent. But three days after talks stalled over the Irish border \"backstop\" thwarting hopes of a deal at the summit May arrived determined to stress that an accord was still on the cards. \"We have shown we can do difficult deals together constructively. I remain confident of a good outcome\" she told the leaders according to a British official. \"The last stage will need courage trust and leadership on both sides.\" It was far from the \"decisive progress\" the 27 had wanted and they agreed to call off -- for now at least -- a planned Nov. 17-18 summit that was to have inked an agreement. Instead May gets some more weeks to resolve the domestic political woes which most EU leaders believe are the real obstacle to a deal. A month after May\\'s last meeting in Austria when her rejection of EU proposals designed to avoid a revival of border tensions in Northern Ireland provoked angry reactions her tone was much calmer said EU officials who were present. \"The tone was more relaxed than in Salzburg undoubtedly. There is a message of goodwill\" said Antonio Tajani president of the European Parliament. \"But I did not perceive anything substantially new in terms of content ... The tone was of someone who wants to reach an agreement.\" An aide to French President Emmanuel Macron said much of the discussion among the 27 was about May\\'s difficulties in getting any deal through parliament where some in her own party would rather walk out of the EU without any strings. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said: \"I am optimistic that we can reach a deal in the next weeks or months.\" EU negotiator Michel Barnier who briefed the leaders believes a deal must be done by December to give parliaments on both sides of the English Channel time to ratify a treaty. TRANSITION PROPOSAL Tajani said he raised with May the possibility that the post-Brexit transition period during which Britain would retain EU rules and so avoid border problems with Ireland could be extended by a year to 2021. EU negotiators proposed this to ease a demand for special rules for Northern Ireland. Such an extension keeping Britain under EU governance with no say in it would be highly unpopular with hardline supporters of Brexit. Tajani said May told him she would consider it but gave no indication of whether she favoured such an extension. May has repeatedly ruled out extending what she calls an implementation period but at least one of her ministers has indicated he may support such a step. She has instead pressed the EU to move on to talks on the future relationship and secure a trade deal that could end the need for a backstop. One EU diplomat closely involved in the negotiations said May\\'s intervention had revived spirits after the disappointments of the weekend: \"The atmosphere has improved. There is more trust and willingness to move forward together.\" Earlier German Chancellor Angela Merkel had cautioned that Europe must prepare for all outcomes: \"That includes the possibility that Britain leaves the European Union without a deal.\" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker briefed the leaders on the EU executive\\'s plans for a no-deal scenario. May will rejoin her EU counterparts on Thursday as the focus shifts to a summit with Asian leaders including China\\'s Premier Li Keqiang and the prime ministers of Japan and Russia. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Updated Britain\\'s weakened prime minister Theresa May appealed to fellow EU leaders on Thursday for concessions to help her win support in parliament next month for a deal that can smooth Britain\\'s exit from the European Union. Arriving at a Brussels summit a day after a failed attempt to topple her at home May said she was not expecting an immediate breakthrough but wanted help to get a Brexit package she agreed with the EU last month ratified in London where many in her Conservative Party say it falls far short of what Britain can accept. May was met largely by readiness to help from European Union leaders but also by a warning: we will not reopen the divorce agreement struck last month. She launched her pitch over dinner to leaders who have said that some kind of declaratory text aimed at easing British concerns could be delivered on Thursday with possibly more to come next month before May puts her package to lawmakers. Diplomats said one option would be to put a date -- possibly end-2021 -- as a non-binding target for concluding a close EU-UK trade alliance that would end the need for the \"Irish backstop\" -- a mechanism anathema to May\\'s party. However even introducing an aspirational date would be hard for some including Dublin to accept as May struggles to find a way to satisfy her critics\\' demand for a strict time-limit. The backstop could leave Britain tied forever to EU customs rules until a better way is agreed to ensure there are no disruptive frontier controls on Northern Ireland\\'s land border with the Irish republic. Britain\\'s departure from the EU its biggest shift in trade and foreign policy for over 40 years is proving far from easy complicated by the deep divisions in her Conservative Party. With less than four months before Britain is due to leave on March 29 May faces deadlock in parliament over the deal which has hardened positions at home throwing up more uncertainty for businesses trying to predict what will happen to the economy. \"I recognise the strength of concern in the House of Commons and that is what I will be putting to colleagues today\" May said. \"I don\\'t expect an immediate breakthrough but what I do hope is that we can start work as quickly as possible on the assurances that are necessary.\" EU leaders were clear. They all said they needed to know exactly what May wanted to secure in Brussels but also warned that Britain could not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. While others tried to temper their language by expressing a desire to help May French President Emmanuel Macron was blunt. \"We cannot reopen a legal agreement we can\\'t renegotiate what was negotiated for several months\" he told reporters. \"It\\'s up to Theresa May to tell us what political solution she expects to pursue to find a majority for this deal.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel was less strident saying: \"We can of course talk about whether there are additional assurances but in this the 27 EU members are together and will make their interests clear although always in the spirit that we want very very good relations with Great Britain after Great Britain has left the European Union.\" May survives May won Wednesday\\'s party ballot 200-117 but the size of the vote against her deepened divisions just weeks before parliament needs to approve a deal to prevent a disorderly exit from the EU. Victory also came at a price - May promised she would step down by the next election scheduled for 2022. Her spokeswoman said that the Brexit deal would be put before parliament \"as soon as possible\" in January. A draft EU statement said leaders were merely \"ready to examine\" whether further assurance can be given. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said it was hard to know what the EU should give to May because it was not clear what she needs to win over opponents. \"Not all the arguments of Brexit supporters are rational\" he said. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite put it more bluntly. \"Brexit Christmas wish: finally decide what you really want and Santa will deliver\" she said on Twitter in posting a picture of a chocolate Christmas tree. Backstop battle The level of opposition to her deal was underlined earlier this week when May was forced to delay a parliamentary vote on her deal for fear of a defeat. May wants legal assurances that the backstop will not remain in place indefinitely. The EU\\'s draft statement seen by Reuters reiterated that it prefers a new trade deal to triggering the Irish backstop and it would try to conclude one swiftly even if the emergency border fix kicks in. Diplomats expect it to change after May tells the other national leaders what she needs. They suggested the EU may be readying more solid assurances for May in January. \"Today is about de-mystifying this whole Northern Ireland backstop. Nobody in the EU wants to use it. But we need to have it\" said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Many German businesses are beginning to shift investments away from Britain in anticipation of increased trade barriers after Brexit the chief of the DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce said yesterday. In a joint statement the DIHK and the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) called for British and European Union negotiators to deliver clarity and certainty for trading businesses across Europe in their negotiations on Britain’s exit from the bloc. The terms of exit are still completely unclear “Businesses are very concerned that Brexit will have a major negative impact” Martin Wansleben chief executive of the DIHK said in the statement adding that Brexit could lead to additional bureaucracy increased waiting times and stricter border controls resulting in higher costs. “The terms of exit are still completely unclear. Many of our members are reporting that they are already shifting investments away from the UK in anticipation of these barriers” he added. British officials arrived in Brussels yesterday to push the EU towards talks about their post-Brexit ties which the bloc refuses to do without an agreement first on London’s exit bill and other divorce issues. Prime Minister Theresa May has been under pressure to back away from her stance that “no [Brexit] deal is better than a bad deal” since losing her governing Conservative Party’s parliamentary majority in an election in June. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Morgan said on Wednesday the chances of Britain calling off its divorce from the European Union had increased after a string of humiliating parliamentary defeats for Prime Minister Theresa May cast new doubt over her plan to quit the bloc and sent sterling higher. Britain\\'s pro-Brexit trade minister Liam Fox also said it was now possible that Brexit would not happen. There was a real danger that parliament would try to \"steal\" Brexit from the British people Fox told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday. In one of the biggest shifts in perceptions since the shock 2016 vote to exit the EU J.P. Morgan raised the probability of Britain ultimately staying in to 40 per cent from 20 per cent. Ever since the referendum investors have speculated that the United Kingdom\\'s biggest economic and political shift since World War Two could ultimately be thwarted though it was unclear what the mechanism might be. \"The UK now appears to have the option of revoking unilaterally and taking a period of time of its own choosing to decide what happens next\" J.P. Morgan economist Malcolm Barr wrote in a note to clients. He placed a 10 per cent probability on a no deal Brexit down from 20 per cent and a 50 per cent probability on an orderly Brexit down from 60 per cent. On Tuesday just hours before the start of a five-day debate in the British parliament on May\\'s Brexit deal an adviser to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) said Britain could pull back its formal divorce notice without needing the agreement of the other 27 members. While it is a non-binding opinion and the ECJ is still to rule the opinion from Advocate General Manuel Campos Sanchez-Bordona also upped the chances of Brexit not happening as planned on March 29. Sterling which has see-sawed on Brexit news since the referendum touched a 17-month low on Tuesday but recouped much of its overnight losses on Wednesday as optimism grew that Britain may not leave the EU without a deal in place. VOTE REVERSE POSSIBLE In the June 23 2016 referendum 17.4 million voters or 52 per cent backed Brexit while 16.1 million or 48 percent backed staying in the bloc. To leave the EU on the terms May has negotiated she needs parliament to approve her deal. Yet that looks unlikely. In significant defeats on Tuesday her government was found in contempt of parliament and then a group of her own Conservative Party lawmakers won a challenge to hand more power to the House of Commons if her deal is voted down. A final vote is due on December 11. If May loses the future of the world\\'s fifth-largest economy is uncertain. She has warned Britain could leave without a deal or that there could be no Brexit at all. J.P. Morgan said a second referendum appeared more likely than a general election as the route to thwarting Brexit. Supporters of Brexit have said that if Brexit is reversed the United Kingdom will be thrust into a constitutional crisis as what they say the financial and political elite will have thwarted the democratic will of the people. But many business chiefs and investors fear a chaotic Brexit that they say would weaken the West spook financial markets and silt up the arteries of trade. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Toby Melville/Reuters  Britain needs a new fiscal plan to navigate economic turbulence caused by Britain’s vote to leave the European Union Chancellor Philip Hammond said yesterday stressing the need to balance spending cuts with infrastructure investment. On Sunday Prime Minister Theresa May told the Conservative Party annual conference she would formally trigger the EU exit by the end of March next year at which point Britain will enter into an initial two-year negotiating period. Speaking ahead of his conference speech Hammond said data from the first half of the year showed the economy was running at “eight out of 10” but that business and consumer confidence could suffer during the long Brexit process. “We must expect some turbulence as we go through this negotiating process” Hammond told BBC television. “There will be a period of a couple of years or perhaps even longer when businesses are uncertain about the final state of our relationship with the EU and during that period we need to support the economy.” He reiterated his decision to push back the government’s target to turn its four per cent 2015/2016 budget deficit – among the biggest of the world’s rich economies – into a surplus by 2020. He has yet to set a new target date. In his speech Hammond said that while budgetary discipline remained crucial for the country there was also a need to invest in building a fairer economy. “The British people elected us on a promise to restore fiscal discipline and that is exactly what we are going to do” he will say according to extracts from the text of his speech provided by his office. “But we will do it in a pragmatic way that reflects the new circumstances we face... A new plan for the new circumstances Britain faces.” Last week official data showed Britain’s giant services sector grew strongly in July giving the clearest sign to date that the economy has not suffered a major slowdown after the EU referendum. Hammond promised to deliver a “clear credible fiscal framework” to reassure investors that he would continue to bring down the deficit by controlling public spending while also focusing on investment needed for long-term growth. “We need to keep the lid on day-to-day spending we need to make government more streamlined and efficient but I do think there is a case that we should look at very carefully for targeted high value investment in our economic infrastructure” he told BBC radio. “In the short term it supports the economy supports jobs supports economic growth and in the long term it helps to make Britain more productive.” Hammond’s full fiscal plan is due to be delivered on November 23. He has previously played down expectations of a surge in public spending to offset any economic hit from the Brexit vote but said he could fund modest infrastructure projects if needed. In the first sign of how he intends to use his new-found fiscal flexibility he set out a new £2 billion borrowing plan to help address a long-term housing shortage. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters  German business morale was surprisingly buoyant this month a survey showed yesterday supporting expectations of a robust start to 2017 in Germany and the eurozone despite worries about US trade policies Brexit and the French election. The sentiment survey published by the Ifo institute yesterday was another sign that growth in the eurozone is picking up. On Tuesday preliminary purchasing manager surveys for Germany France and the whole 19-member eurozone were nearly all better than expected. There is a relatively strong correlation between German economic growth and that of the eurozone. “The mood defies the risks posed by Trump and the French presidential elections – especially because consumption is strong” Commerzbank chief economist Joerg Kraemer said. The US has become the biggest client for ‘Made in Germany’ products taking nearly 10 per cent of overall exports and propelling Germany’s record-high trade surplus. But US President Donald Trump has threatened German carmakers with a border tax of 35 per cent on imported vehicles arguing that such a step would make them create more jobs on American soil. There is a relatively strong correlation between German economic growth and that of the eurozone In France Germany’s second-most important export destination the outcome of elections has unnerved investors as anti-euro far-right leader Marine Le Pen has narrowed the gap with centrist opponents in the race for the presidency. Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said Trump’s protectionist plans did not seem to unsettle German companies for now and that the Ifo figures pointed to strong economic growth in the first quarter. Munich-based Ifo said its business climate index based on a monthly survey of some 7000 companies rose to 111.0 from an upwardly revised reading of 109.9 in January. That beat the Reuters consensus forecast for a dip to 109.6. That assessment of the current business situation reached its highest level since August 2011 while companies also expressed greater optimism about the months ahead. Morale improved in manufacturing and wholesale whereas construction and retailing managers were less upbeat. Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said neither Trump’s policies nor Britain’s planned departure from the EU – Brexit – were hurting the German economy or the mood in corporate boardrooms. He said: “The German economy is in surprisingly strong shape in politically uncertain times.” Ifo’s figures came after the German purchasing managers survey showed that private-sector growth picked up in February to its highest level in nearly three years driven by humming factories. In addition reports earlier this month showed industrial orders posted their biggest monthly increase in around two-and-a-half years driven mainly by higher demand at home and abroad for goods needed in production.

Senior Tories have warned that the campaign is pushing Tories to the brink of \"civil war\" and the party is facing \"grave\" consequences whatever the outcome of the vote. Feelings are running \"very high\" and coming to terms with the result will be a \"devil of a job\" Ken Clarke said. Mr Cameron earlier this week insisted he would remain Prime Minister even if he lost the June 23 referendum. But Mr Clarke told Radio 4\\'s Week In Westminster: \"The Prime Minister wouldn\\'t last 30 seconds if he lost the referendum and we\\'d be plunged into a Conservative leadership crisis which is never a very edifying sight.\" He added: \"He\\'d be in a farcical position having campaigned for a position that\\'s been rejected. He\\'d be a Prime Minister facing a parliament in which the majority of the MPs wanted to remain in the EU. \\'Leave\\' is in a minority in the Conservative parliamentary party. \"The House of Commons as a whole is overwhelmingly in favour of staying in the European Union. And the idea that David carries on saying: \\'Well despite what I\\'ve been saying in the last few weeks I\\'m now going to lead a government which is going to leave the European Union and I\\'m going to sit down with you all and find out what it is you want to negotiate that will determine new arrangements for ourselves and our businesses and for our investors that secure a new base for us in the globalised economy\\' I mean it\\'s just farcical. \"The fact is feeling is now running very high. Whichever way it goes the party is going to have a devil of a job coming to terms. And for a prime minister to emerge in that climate it is all very worrying. But it won\\'t be David Cameron.\" The veteran Tory said the mood in the party was heading towards the bitter divisions that left it badly damaged following clashes about the EU under Sir John Major. Mr Clarke said: \"It\\'s dangerously close to it. And we\\'ve all got to make sure on both sides that it doesn\\'t go back that way. The party was unelectable because it had just had the most appallingly bitter civil war and it was impossible to see how it could carry on. Now we mustn\\'t repeat that I agree.\" Senior Tory Bernard Jenkin warned of \"grave\" consequences for the party whatever the outcome of the vote. He told the programme: \"I think the Conservative Party will be in grave danger from the consequences of the result. I think a lot of people will leave the Conservative Party. \"I expect whatever emerges from the wreckage of Ukip will be more potent than before. I think these are very great dangers. And a Remain vote paradoxically makes a (Jeremy) Corbyn government somewhat more likely because the Conservative Party will be in such an unhappy state.\" The warnings come as Boris Johnson continues his \"Brexit blitz\" across the north following a rally in Manchester where he warned the June 23 poll is the \"last chance\" many voters will have to decide Britain\\'s relationship with Brussels. London\\'s mayor took a swipe at remain campaigners who say the EU is not perfect but claim there is no alternative. Describing them as the \"Gerald Ratners\" of modern politics the mayor said there was \"not a shred of idealism\" in their campaign. Mr Cameron is among those campaigning for Britain to remain while admitting it is \"not perfect\". \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Despite a slick campaign to lure companies from London to Berlin after Britain voted to leave the European Union some of those which have moved say it is not as easy as it first appeared. Following the referendum decision in June Germany’s liberal Free Democrats hired a truck to drive around London with a billboard declaring ‘Dear start-ups Keep calm and move to Berlin’. An ironic reference to a popular poster entreating Britons to Keep Calm and Carry On at the outbreak of World War II it was soon followed by the opening of an official Berlin marketing office in London. Two London based companies have already taken the plunge. Web-design company MBJ London and real-estate investment platform Brickvest had already planned to open offices in Berlin but were jolted into speeding up their investments by Britons’ June 23 decision. The motivation: to limit their London exposure in case of a hard Brexit – where Britain loses access to the single market. The two firms cite access to talent and the low cost of living among Berlin’s benefits as well as a hotline to help start-ups get employee visas. But they urged the city to lower language and regulatory hurdles. “If it wants to become the leader in fintech then these are the steps it needs to take otherwise it will get a few companies but it will not become the hub” said Brickvest co-founder Thomas Schneider. Brickvest is building a back office in Berlin and plans to grow its staff from five to 15 people over the next six months. But Schneider said the German financial regulator BaFin was too conservative and the fact that all documents must be translated into German to apply for a banking licence was off-putting for companies like his which employs 10 nationalities. MBJ plans to build up its operational team in Berlin and more than double its headcount. Management will also move from London. But it took the company around two months to set up base compared with some three days in London said MBJ’s Chief Operating Officer Toni Horn. The start-up needed to get documents approved by a notary and had to go to court to get the company registered. Setting up a bank account was tricky as was finding office space with most landlords offering rental contracts for three to five years - an impractical time-frame for a start-up that may outgrow the space within a year or fold. Instead MBJ has rented an office at co-working space WeWork at Potsdamer Platz a desolate no-man’s land during the Cold War that has become one of the capital’s busiest commercial centres. Since the Brexit vote the city government’s marketing agency Berlin Partner has helped five companies move from London and received some 40 specific inquiries mainly from start-ups founded three to five years ago in the fintech and IT sectors. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Global stock markets eased while the yen firmed yesterday amid concerns Britain may be on the verge of leaving the European Union following a June 23 referendum on its membership an outcome that could adversely impact the world economy. A vote to leave the 28-member bloc dubbed “Brexit” could tip Europe back into recession and has surged to the forefront of investor concerns. Uncertainty over the outcome of this week’s US Federal Open Market Committee policy meeting contributed to market worries though the US central bank is expected to leave rates unchanged. A much weaker-than-expected US employment report for May has drastically reduced the chances of the Fed hiking rates either in June or July. Boris Schlossberg managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York said Brexit has kept the market on edge. He cited the unknown impact on the British economy as well as the fact that the exit would “present the first formal challenge to the current global economic order and could spark a much wider and more dangerous fracture of the European Union”. The euro dropped to its lowest against the yen 119.01  since February 2013. It was last at 119.88 down 0.4 per cent. Sterling which was down broadly also fell to a three-year low of 149.50 yen. The pound last traded down 0.7 per cent at 151.79 yen. Wall Street fell slightly in late morning trading in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 49.68 points or 0.28 per cent to 17815.66 the S&P 500 lost 6.73 points or 0.32 per cent to 2089.34 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 24.75 points or 0.51 per cent to 4869.80. European shares fell to their lowest in more than two months amid unease over a possible British exit from the European Union. MSCI’s all-country world stock index was down one per cent while the FTSEurofirst 300 closed down 1.6 per cent. Data out of China showing fixed-asset investment slipped below 10 per cent for the first time since 2000 added to day’s weaker tone in equities. US Treasury yields fell to a four-month low as increased fears about Britain exiting the EU weighed on investor risk appetite. Benchmark 10-year notes rose 2/32 in price to yield 1.63 per cent after earlier falling to 1.61 per cent the lowest since February 11. Ten-year yields in Germany remained near zero close to record lows. Oil prices were down in volatile trading. Brent dipped 0.57 per cent to $50.25 while US crude futures fell 0.61 per cent to $48.77. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  The country will keep moving forward “regardless” of the Brexit vote decision this week Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said this morning. Speaking during a Labour Party activity in Sta Venera Dr Muscat said that while Malta would stand to lose from the United Kingdom leaving the EU the government had already set out a course of action for such an eventuality. “We will not stand still this country will continue moving forward” he said adding that next week the Cabinet would meet to discuss the way forward. On Thursday British voters will decide in a referendum whether the UK is to remain an EU member or not. According to the International Monetary Fund Malta is among the countries that stand to lose the most from a potential Brexit. Dr Muscat said that while Malta would in no way interfere with the UK’s decision process the island could sympathise with having to weigh the pros and cons of membership. Malta he said had gone through a long national debate on the strengths and weaknesses of joining the EU prior to finally joining back in 2004. Turning to the murder of British MP Jo Cox last week Dr Muscat said political hatred and fear mongering had led to violence. Mrs Cox 41 was shot and stabbed in Birstall West Yorkshire on Thursday. Those who spread hate in Malta should be exiled from the political class and could not be tolerated Dr Muscat said. The Labour Party leader then turned to the local political scene branding once again Opposition leader Simon Busuttil as “Mr Double Standards”. Dr Muscat questioned how Dr Busuttil had allowed Victoria mayor Samuel Azzopardi to be reinstated after he was found guilty of drink-driving. Insisting that he was not passing judgement on Mr Azzopardi Dr Muscat recalled how Dr Busuttil had called for Justice Minister Owen Bonnici to resign after he was involved in a car accident back in 2014. “He didn’t even wait for an inquiry to call for Dr Bonnici’s resignation. But then when faced with a case in which someone was found guilty his position is suddenly different” Dr Muscat said. He then turned to PN MP Toni Bezzina. A court ruled that a 2012 newspaper report detailing how government resources were used by Mr Bezzina for partisan purposes was true.The report had detailed how Mr Bezzina had ordered three government workers to carry out work at the PN club in Żurrieq using government-owned materials. The report said the workers were then made to sign an affidavit saying the works were carried out voluntarily in their own personal time. “Will Dr Busuttil be calling for a resignation here?” Dr Muscat asked. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Global stock indexes jumped yesterday and sterling rebounded broadly after polls showed support for Britain staying in he EU strengthened before Thursday’s referendum. At the start of what could be a frenetic weak for global markets safe-haven assets such as the yen and gold retreated. Monday’s surge in equity markets saw Wall Street recover losses from last week when the chances of the United Kingdom leaving the EU or “Brexit” appear\\xaded to be gaining momentum. The surge in sterling which rose more than two per cent against the dollar coincided with a broad retreat in the green back as several polls showed the “Leave” campaign weakening. Markets will likely remain volatile and headline-driven in the run-up to the vote which still appears too close to call. The MSCI’s all-country world stock index surged 2.1 per cent while Wall Street stocks as measured by the S&P 500 jumped 1.2 per cent their strongest daily increase in nearly three weeks. Two polls showed “In” regaining the lead and another showed the “Out” campaign’s lead narrowing though the overall picture was of an evenly-split electorate. Bookmakers’ odds have shown those wishing to stay in the EU ahead and Betfair put the implied probability of a vote to “Remain” at 72 per cent yesterday up from 60-67 per cent on Friday. US Treasury yields rose as traders trimmed safe-haven holdings of lower-risk government debt. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR rose over 5 basis points from late Friday to 1.675 per cent after reaching 1.680 per cent earlier yesterday. The “risk on” move was more pronounced in Europe. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index added 3.7 per cent led by a 4.3 per cent rise in banks while Britain’s blue-chip FTSE 100 index chalked up a 3.1 per cent gain. Sterling rose as far as $1.4707 and was last up 2.4 per cent at $1.4693 having hit a two-week low of $1.4013 on Thursday. It soared 2.7 per cent to 153.53 yen and 1.9 per cent against the euro to 77.08 pence. The euro which has also suffered due to “Brexit” worries strengthened 0.5 per cent to $1.1329 after rising as far as $1.1382. The yen often sought by investors in times of market tension fell 0.4 per cent to 104.45 per dollar. The dollar fell 0.7 per cent against a basket of currencies. German 10-year government debt yielded 0.063 per cent up from a record low of minus 0.037 per cent on Thursday. Oil prices which have also been under pressure extended Friday’s gains. Brent crude topped $50 a barrel for the first time since June 14. It last traded at $50.42 up $1.24 on the day. Gold another safety play fell 1.1 per cent to just below $1285 an ounce. It rose 1.5 per cent on Friday for its biggest single-day gain since June 3. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Scotland\\'s parliament would consider blocking legislation on Britain\\'s exit from the European Union if that were necessary to protect Scottish interests First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Sunday. Scotland a nation of five million people voted to stay in the EU by 62 to 38 percent in a referendum on Thursday putting it at odds with the United Kingdom as a whole which voted 52 to 48 percent in favour of an exit from the bloc or Brexit. Under the United Kingdom\\'s complex arrangements to devolve some powers to Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland legislation generated in London to give effect to the vote to leave the EU would have to gain consent from the three devolved parliaments. Asked on BBC television whether she would consider asking the Scottish parliament to block a motion of legislative consent Sturgeon said: \"Of course.\" \"If the Scottish parliament was judging this on the basis of what\\'s right for Scotland then the option of saying that we\\'re not going to vote for something that is against Scotland\\'s interest of course that\\'s going to be on the table.\" \"Don\\'t get me wrong I care about the rest of the UK I care about England that\\'s why I\\'m so upset at the UK-wide decision that\\'s been taken. But my job as First Minister the Scottish parliament\\'s job is to judge these things on the basis of what\\'s in the interest of people in Scotland.\" Sturgeon leader of a party that wants Scotland to become independent of the UK while remaining in the EU has repeatedly said since the referendum result was announced on Friday that she would take whatever steps were necessary to ensure that Scotland\\'s democratic will was respected. That means that a new referendum on Scottish independence was now \"highly likely\" she has said arguing that splitting away from the United Kingdom may be the only way for Scotland to remain in the EU while the rest of the UK exits. Scots voted against independence by 55 to 45 percent in a 2014 referendum after a campaign during which remaining in the EU was presented as one of the main attractions of sticking with the UK. Asked what she would do if the UK\\'s central government tried to block Scotland from holding an independence referendum Sturgeon has repeatedly said it was \"inconceivable\" that London would stand in the way of Scotland exercising its own democratic way. Asked on the BBC if she could imagine the fury of British voters who had made the choice to leave the EU if the Scottish parliament blocked Brexit Sturgeon said: \"I can but it\\'s perhaps similar to the fury of many people in Scotland right now as we face the prospect of being taken out of the European Union against our will.\"\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Ms Miller was also targeted with racism for spearheading a High Court challenge to uphold Parliament\\'s right to vote before triggering the mechanism for the EU exit. The torrent of abuse intensified after the investment fund manager and philanthropist celebrated the judges\\' ruling. One of the many comments posted on social media. She told Radio 5 live that it included \"I should be beheaded gang raped I\\'m not even human I\\'m a primate I belong in a kitchen - that\\'s the nicest of some of them. It is unbelievable\". When asked if she had reported it to police she said: \"I\\'m considering what to do and I will be but others have done so on my behalf because I have to say I have stayed away from social media and Twitter etc. For my own sanity I haven\\'t read an awful lot of the press and things today. Miller laid the blame with certain politicians and elements of the media which she believes encouraged the abuse \"But other people on my behalf have felt concerned and have said they have reported it on my behalf and I\\'m aware there is a sort of feeding frenzy happening and that I may well have to do so in the next few days.\" The High Court ruling which she was among a group to campaign for means Prime Minister Theresa May cannot formally start the Brexit process without consulting MPs. Ms Miller 51 laid the blame with certain politicians and elements of the media which she believes encouraged the abuse. She said: \"I\\'m apparently the most hated woman in Britain and the vitriol continues but I am really cross at the politicians and the media who are whipping this up because they are the ones inciting racism and violence and acrimony.\" Among the threats were calls for Ms Miller to be deported to Guyana South America where she was born. One Twitter user wrote: \"Gina Miller is NOT even British this black immigrant bitch should be deported she is a f***ing traitor to the UK.\" Another tweeted: \"Get the f*** out of our country deport the bitch.\" One troll wrote on Facebook: \"I hope she gets f***ing killed\" while another said: \"Kill her! 2 behind the ear. Throw her in the garbage. Dustbin whatever.\" If convicted under the Malicious Communications Act online trolls can face up to five years\\' imprisonment. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The former prime minister said last year\\'s vote for Brexit - which he strongly opposed - had given him the impetus to become involved in politics again. While he made clear that he was not planning a return to Parliament he told the Daily Mirror that he wanted to help shape the policy debate. \"This Brexit thing has given me a direct motivation to get more involved in the politics. You need to get your hands dirty and I will\" he said in an interview to mark the 20th anniversary of his 1997 general election triumph. I know the moment I stick my head out the door I\\'ll get a bucket of wotsit poured all over me but I really do feel passionate about this \"I am going to be taking an active part in trying to shape the policy debate and that means getting out and reconnecting. \"I know the moment I stick my head out the door I\\'ll get a bucket of wotsit poured all over me but I really do feel passionate about this. \"I don\\'t want to be in the situation where we pass through this moment of history and I hadn\\'t said anything because that would mean I didn\\'t care about this country. I do.\" Mr Blair warned that Britain would be worse off outside the EU and suggested the country may eventually wish to return. \"The single market put us in the Champions League of trading agreements. A free trade agreement is like League One. We are relegating ourselves\" he said. \"My prediction is it may take another generation but at some point we will want to be back in the EU - there is a direct link between the number of people and the size of an economy.\" In a separate interview with GQ magazine Mr Blair admitted that 10 years after leaving office he still found it hard to cope with the idea that he was a hate figure to some people. \"Yep it\\'s hard. It\\'s all about coming to terms with the fact that when you\\'re running for power you can be all things to all people\" he said. \"But when you achieve power you have to make decisions and when that happens and the process of government is your life you become less popular\" he said The former PM said he should have communicated more after he left power because his silence had allowed others to portray him in a bad light. \"That was definitely a mistake. If you read about what I have been doing these last 10 years you\\'d think I have just been going round the world making money when I have spent the vast bulk of my time in the Middle East in Africa on the things I believe in.\" Mr Blair who has been widely criticised over the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq in 2003 described the current situation in Syria as a \"hideous blot\" on Western foreign policy. \"When the Arab Spring began what I said to people was be very careful because you have been through a situation in Iraq and Afghanistan where you have removed a dictatorship but then the problems begin. \"So if you can evolve a transition do that. My view on Syria and Libya was it would have been better to have agreed a process of transition so if you could cut a deal which I think you could have with Gaddafi or Assad for transition that would be better. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Lloyd’s of London’s Beazley plc is working to get European insurance licences for its Irish reinsurance business to allow it to operate throughout the European Union even if Lloyd’s loses access to the bloc. Insurers are making contingency plans after Britain’s vote last month to leave the EU left them facing the risk they could lose ‘passporting’ rights that enable them to sell their products throughout Europe. “We’re looking at getting the licences for our EU reinsurance company in Dublin and have an EU insurance company which will give us some protection for growing in Europe into the future if there are problems with the Lloyd’s licences” chief executive Andrew Horton told Reuters. Britain’s insurance and banking industries – the biggest in Europe – are seen as some of the sectors with the most to lose following the Brexit vote due to their reliance on the passporting system. Dublin is the favoured alternative hub to London for insurers due to its geographical proximity and similar regulatory regime as well as Ireland being an English-speaking country industry specialists say. It is already considered an insurance centre with giant insurer Zurich having its European HQ there. Ahead of the referendum Lloyd’s which groups more than 80 insurance syndicates in the City of London warned that the specialist insurance market would be less appealing to investors outside Britain after a Brexit vote. Beazley’s Horton said the firm’s main aim is to lobby with Lloyd’s to ensure that the Lloyd’s market manages to maintain the insurance licences that allow it access to the EU bloc. The company is keen to do all it can to ensure continued access to Europe as it hopes to replicate there the success of its US speciality lines business – which covers niche types of insurance ranging from fine art to kidnap and ransom. Beazley which provides marine casualty and property insurance and reinsurance reported a three per cent fall in first-half pretax profit as premium rates declined for much of the large risk business the company underwrites in London. Gross written premiums however rose about two per cent to $1.12 billion over the period buoyed by strong growth of the firm’s speciality lines business in the United States which accounts for about 85 per cent to 90 per cent of its specialty lines business. Horton said Beazley expected its US and UK speciality lines business to compensate for fewer premiums written in marine and property accounts in the second half. Over the six months ended June 30 pre-tax profit fell to $150.2 million due to fewer catastrophes against a record $154.5 million in the first half of last year. The Canadian wildfire was the only significant catastrophe over the period Horton said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Global banks are still filling job vacancies in London despite concerns that Brexit could threaten the city’s status as a major financial centre recruiter Hays said yesterday. Although many financial companies have plans to transfer some jobs to continental Europe to keep serving clients in the single market once Britain leaves the European Union Hays said they were holding off on pulling the trigger. “The banks have got their contingency plans in place but they’re waiting to see if they can get any steer at all on the eventual deal that will be done” Finance Director Paul Venables told Reuters. “The pleasing part is that leavers (in London) are being replaced. This is encouraging for the future of the financial services industry in London. It will still be a very large business when we get through the Brexit part” he added. Venables said London banks were replacing departing staff in most roles including in IT and compliance. Smaller rival Robert Walters said on Tuesday that risk regulatory audit and cybersecurity were the strongest job functions in finance at the moment. Hays said banks had begun moving staff from Britain to Europe but numbers remained relatively small. It had not received requests for large-scale financial hiring in Europe mirroring comments from PageGroup and Robert Walters earlier this week. Hays said net fees from its UK and Ireland operations rose one per cent in the three months ended September 30 on the same period last year showing an improvement against a five per cent fall in the preceding quarter. Hays said its British private sector business continued to experience modest signs of improvement and Venables forecast that growth in the UK over the next few quarters would remain in line with the first quarter. “There’s still very tight cost control across most companies in the UK but some of the investments that were put on hold a year ago a small proportion of those are now being released” he said. The group which gets most of its business from outside the UK also noted growth across its other regions pushing quarterly group net fees up 10 per cent ahead of consensus of a 8.5 per cent rise. While Hays’ quarterly performance lagged Robert Walters which has broken ahead of the pack due to growth in its outsourcing business it was broadly in line with the 8.8 per cent growth reported by PageGroup on Wednesday. PageGroup noted a sharper decline in its British business from the previous quarter. “We believe investors are likely to focus on the marginal growth in UK which will come as a relief for the market following yesterday’s weaker than expected UK figures from PageGroup” Panmure Gordon analyst Adrian Kearsey wrote. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Ireland\\'s minority government looked set to collapse on Friday after the party propping it up submitted a motion of no confidence in the deputy prime minister weeks before a summit on Britain\\'s plans to leave the European Union. The crisis is likely to lead to an election next month or in January and may complicate the December 14-15 Brexit summit. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar is due to play a major role in the talks telling EU leaders whether Ireland believes sufficient progress has been made on the future border between EU-member Ireland and Britain\\'s province of Northern Ireland. The border is one of three issues Brussels wants broadly resolved before it decides whether to move the talks on to a second phase about trade as Britain wants. Varadkar is now likely to go into the summit as a lame duck prime minister or in the middle of an election campaign. The head of opposition party Fianna Fail Micheal Martin said his party had submitted a motion of no-confidence in Deputy Prime Minister Frances Fitzgerald to be debated on Tuesday. The trigger is her handling of a legal case involving a police whistleblower. Martin told state broadcaster RTE that an election \"can be avoided if the government takes action\" by asking Fitzgerald to resign. But the government said this would not happen. Varadkar and Martin met briefly to discuss the standoff on Friday and are due to speak again on Saturday. \"At a time when issues and decisions will need to be made that will reverberate in our country for decades to come the prospect of either an election taking place or a government not being in place afterwards is actually unconscionable\" Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe told RTE. \"These are historic decisions ... The agenda that is at play here is one of political interest. We need to be aware of the consequences of the approach that Fianna Fail are taking here\" the usually calm Donohoe fumed. Junior Finance Minister Michael D\\'Arcy told Reuters he believed there would be an election before Christmas and a source familiar with the party\\'s planning said it had begun to make preparations on Friday for an election. As well as the border the other issues Brussels wants resolved before talks move on to trade arrangements are Britain\\'s financial settlement on leaving the bloc and the rights of EU citizens living in Britain. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier assured Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney on Friday that the EU would defend Dublin\\'s position in talks with Britain over the coming weeks. \"Strong solidarity with Ireland\" Barnier tweeted. \"Irish issues are EU issues.\" A snap election next month in the Irish Republic would also rule out a resumption of talks to restore a devolved government in Northern Ireland the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Arlene Foster told BBC. The DUP has for months been in on-off talks with the Irish nationalists Sinn Fein to break a political stalemate north of the border. As Sinn Fein also fields candidates in the south Foster said their focus would be entirely on that. The Fianna Fail move comes after Fitzgerald admitted she was made aware of an attempt to discredit a police whistleblower in a 2015 email but failed to act. Fine Gael say she adhered to due process. The case relates to a whistleblower who alleged widespread misconduct in the force. His treatment by the authorities led in 2014 to the resignations of the then police commissioner and justice minister. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The British government helped to secure a more than 240-million pound investment from Toyota in its English plant with a letter reassuring the Japanese carmaker over post-Brexit trading arrangements two sources told Reuters. Toyota said on March 16 it would install its new car platform at its Burnaston plant. One source who is familiar with the letter said that Toyota delayed the decision due by the end of December while it weighed up a number of factors including Brexit. The business ministry has confirmed the existence of a letter but refused to release it. The source said the letter was similar to one sent to Japanese carmaker Nissan last year when it decided to build two new models at its northern English plant. The document sparked public and lawmaker concern about secretive deals. The source who did not say when the letter was sent said it contained several reassurances. “They received a similar set of warm words as Nissan on electric vehicles commitment to further training and to ensure the competitiveness of the UK automotive industry” the source said. A Toyota spokesman declined to comment on whether it had received such a letter. He referred to the company’s March 16 statement which said the British government was providing funding for training and research and development. Toyota also said at the time that “continued tariff-and-barrier free market access... will be vital for future success.” Britain said in March it would back up the investment from Toyota which builds roughly 10 per cent of Britain’s 1.7 million cars by spending 21.3 million pounds to support skills and training research and development and innovation subject to an independent assessment. A spokesman at the business ministry declined to provide any comment for this story. Business minister Greg Clark said last year that assurances offered to Nissan were available to other firms. Reuters made a freedom of information (FOI) request to the business ministry to see documentation relating to the investment decision which the ministry said included a letter. In its response an official at the ministry refused to release the letter and a company briefing note saying the information was “both highly commercially sensitive” and “would be likely to cause harm to the company’s commercial interests if disclosed.” Meanwhile Mr Clark has refused to publish the Nissan letter. He said he will release the information when it is no longer commercially confidential. Many of the world’s biggest car firms are worried about the long-term viability of their British plants and are using their upcoming investment decisions to push for promises to maintain free trade after Britain’s exit from the EU which is due to take place in March 2019. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The decision to move the European Banking Authority to Paris will boost its chances of attracting London banks after Brexit French officials said yesterday. Paris won over Dublin in a lucky dip after a voting run-off produced a tied result on Monday evening. Frankfurt seen by many as favourite did not even make it to the final two in the battle to replace London as home to the organisation that sets banking rules across the bloc and employs 185 people. Frankfurt and Paris are at the forefront of the race among European cities to attract London businesses that need an EU hub to continue serving customers in the bloc after Britain leaves in March 2019. Goldman Sachs has said it will make Paris and Frankfurt its European hubs after Brexit. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the decision to put the EBA in Paris sent exactly the sort of signal that big banks such as Goldman and Morgan Stanley were waiting for. “It’s indeed a very strong signal firstly that financial stability will be decided in Paris” Mr Le Maire said on the sidelines of an innovation conference at the Finance Ministry. “The second signal which I think is excellent news for Paris is that Paris will become one of the big European financial centres if not the biggest. It’s also a signal to big international institutions.” Mr Le Maire said the government still had to take several important decisions notably on labour costs but that he expected many big banks to come to Paris. Germany left licking its wounds after a setback to both the country and Merkel Bagging the European Banking Authority marks an unexpected win for the French capital given that its bid was among the least generous financially. It is also unusual because it puts two such regulators in one location joining the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and prompting some officials to speculate that they could cooperate more closely to exert greater influence. “Personally I’m very happy with this decision. Paris was top of my list” said EBA spokeswoman Franca Rosa Congiu. Though the EBA employs only 185 staff it plays a core role in turning EU banking law into rules for supervisors to enforce. It also runs the biannual stress test of leading EU lenders. While Paris revels in its victory Germany was left licking its wounds after a setback to both the country and its Chancellor Angela Merkel. The German Premier had called for the watchdog to be based in Frankfurt which is already home to the European Central Bank (ECB). “We would have preferred a different decision because we believe that Frankfurt all things considered best meets the criteria stipulated” said Lutz Raettig president of the lobby group Frankfurt Main Finance. Gerhard Hofmann a member of the board of the National Association of German Cooperative Banks said the EU was missing out on an opportunity to move the EBA close to the ECB. “In light of the fact that there is great overlap in the mandates of both institutions as well as the significance of Frankfurt as a banking and financial capital in Europe Frankfurt was well positioned” Mr Hofmann said. But Volker Bouffier prime minister of Frankfurt’s home state of Hesse said the city would remain “the most significant financial capital on the European continent” regardless. “A host of banks have already announced their intentions to base themselves in Frankfurt or expand there” he said. “We are sure that we will continue to be successful on that front.” Nonetheless the win is a considerable boost for France. “We thought that we had lost the battle against Frankfurt but this big win establishes an equilibrium between the two” one French banker said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

In a notice to all airlines a stark reminder of the risks facing the sector if there is no Brexit deal the European Commission said UK air carriers would no longer enjoy traffic rights under any air transport agreement to which the EU is a party such as the US-EU Open Skies agreement. They would also lose flying rights under agreements between individual EU member states and third countries as they would not longer be considered EU airlines. More than one in every two passengers handled by UK airports is flying to or from the rest of the EU making the British market heavily dependent on the EU In addition all operating licences granted by the British civil aviation authority will no longer be valid for the EU the notice said which means the airlines would be cut off from the intra-EU market. \"In order to continue benefiting from the freedoms of establishment and to provide air services within the EU internal market as of the withdrawal date air carriers are advised to consider any measure required to ensure that the conditions for holding an EU operating licence are complied with in all circumstances\" the notice said. Airlines based in the EU have the right to fly to from and within any country in the bloc thanks to the single aviation market was created in the 1990s but Britain now has less than two years to renegotiate access or come up with an alternative system. British carriers include easyJet IAG\\'s British Airways Flybe Jet2 and Virgin Atlantic. Budget airline easyJet has already moved to establish a new airline in Austria to protect its flying rights within the EU once Britain leaves the bloc. Without a deal airlines would have to rely on a decades-old traffic rights accord between the UK and EU states Both airlines and airports have been vocal about the risks posed by the no-deal scenario and have urged London and Brussels to quickly provide certainty for the industry. Airport operators\\' association Airports Council International has pointed out that more than one in every two passengers handled by UK airports is flying to or from the rest of the EU making the British market heavily dependent on the EU. Without a deal airlines would have to rely on a decades-old traffic rights accord between the UK and EU states. These are typically more restrictive and many observers have doubts as to their validity. Britain and the EU clinched a divorce deal last Friday paving the way for them to start talks on future trade ties and a two-year Brexit transition period that will start when Britain leaves the EU on March 29 2019. However Brussels has ruled out a separate deal just for aviation on the grounds that it would be tantamount to cherry-picking. A Commission spokesman said the notice did not cover the situation of UK traffic rights to and from EU member states that \"will be determined in due course\". \"The notice is without prejudice to possible transitional arrangements on which talks may start in January\" the notice said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The London Stock Exchange named Goldman Sachs’ veteran David Schwimmer as chief executive officer last week with an initial challenge of helping the 300-year-old institution to navigate Brexit. Analysts expressed relief that the LSE had finally been able to find an external candidate after a boardroom battle involving activist hedge fund TCI led to the departure last November of CEO Xavier Rolet. Schwimmer a 49-year-old New Yorker who has been with Goldman for 20 years and most recently served as global head of market structure and global head of metals and mining in investment banking takes up the role at the start of August. Schwimmer who attended Harvard Law School and Yale University will earn an annual salary of £775000 with a bonus of up to 225 per cent of his salary LSE said. He will also get £1.05 million in compensation in March next year for giving up his 2018 cash awards at Goldman. He is well known for his robust intellect and partnership approach with clients Frenchman Rolet left after almost a decade at the helm during which he transformed the company with a string of deals lifting its market value to almost £14 billion from less than £1 billion. Schwimmer takes charge as Britain’s planned departure from the EU in 2019 raises questions about the LSE’s strategy at the heart of Europe’s biggest financial centre. Although the LSE owns the Milan Exchange and has clearing operations in Paris it is unclear how much direct access financial firms in Britain will have to EU customers after Brexit. Schwimmer will have to protect LSE’s dominance in euro clearing as rival Deutsche Boerse in Frankfurt is already seeking to exploit uncertainty to build up business. He will also lead the LSE’s efforts to woo oil giant Saudi Aramco to London for what is expected to be the world’s largest initial public offering. “David is a leader with great experience in the financial market infrastructure sector... as well as capital markets experience in both developed and emerging markets” LSE chairman Donald Brydon said in a statement. “He is well known for his robust intellect and partnership approach with clients and colleagues alike” Brydon added. Group CFO David Warren who was acting CEO will continue as the company’s finance boss. The LSE is seen in the market as a takeover target rather than a predator with rivals Intercontinental Exchange and CME in the US long seen as suitors analysts said. “We think the appointment of Mr Schwimmer a former M&A banker will allow LSE to continue to look for inorganic growthopportunities in line with LSE’s strategy” UBS analyst Michael Werner said in a note to clients. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain will have a good set of proposals on Brexit policy ready for a meeting of European Union leaders this month interior minister Sajid Javid said on Sunday adding that he expected a positive response from Brussels. He rejected a newspaper report saying failure to reach an exit deal with the EU would cause immediate shortages of medicine fuel and food. Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to find a proposal on post-Brexit customs arrangements - the biggest stumbling block so far in exit talks - to take into negotiations with Brussels as the clock ticks down to Britain\\'s scheduled exit in March 2019. Ireland said on Saturday that May had two weeks to put forward proposals but her cabinet is divided and EU officials have poured scorn on draft options under discussion in London. The Sunday Times said shortages would kick in within two weeks of a \\'no deal\\' scenario. Javid said discussions between ministers on agreeing a position were making good progress ahead of the June 28-29 summit. \"I am absolutely confident as we get to the June council meeting that the prime minister will have a good set of proposals and our colleagues in Europe will respond positively to them\" Javid told the BBC. He said the proposals would be in line with previous statements by May and that a promised white paper policy document would be published in advance of the summit. The border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland will be Britain\\'s only land frontier with the EU after it leaves the bloc. While both sides say they are committed to keeping the border open finding a practical solution is proving elusive. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney warned of an \"uncertain summer\" if there was no progress on agreeing the so-called \\'backstop\\' arrangement to prevent a hard border in the event of trade talks failing. The Sunday Times reported that a failure to reach an exit agreement with the EU would cause shortages of medicine fuel and food within two weeks citing an unnamed source\\'s account of a document prepared by officials for Britain\\'s negotiators. Since Britain\\'s shock June 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU May has insisted that leaving without a deal would be a better outcome than negotiating a poor settlement with Brussels. The government says it is aiming to get a deal but still preparing for all scenarios including a no deal outcome. The newspaper report of a document listing three no deal scenarios said that even under the second worst outcome the port of Dover would collapse almost immediately supermarkets in Scotland would run out of food within days and medicine supplies would only last weeks. Javid dismissed the details of the Sunday Times report. \"I don\\'t recognise any bit of that at all. As Home Secretary as anyone would expect I\\'m deeply involved in \\'No Deal\\' preparations ... but I don\\'t recognise any of that\" he said. He said he remained confident that Britain would agree a withdrawal deal with the EU. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Sterling had been mostly stronger against both the dollar and the euro in the runup to the vote but then fell to its lowest point against the greenback in more than two weeks. “Sterling’s midday bounce felt a long way away on Friday afternoon as MPs inflicted another embarrassment on a Theresa May premiership defined by them” said Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell. Lawmakers in Parliament’s lower House of Commons defied Ms May’s plea to end a political deadlock over Brexit defeating her withdrawal agreement by 344 votes to 286. “No-one really wants to say it but we are in danger of sleepwalking into an unintended no-deal scenario here an outcome that looked highly unlikely just a couple of weeks back and this poses a major risk for the pound” said XTB analyst David Cheetham. The EU Commission seemed to agree saying after the vote that a no-deal Brexit was now a “likely scenario”. The pivotal vote came on the day Britain was supposed to leave the European Union until Ms May asked the bloc’s leaders last week for a little more time. Stock markets including London meanwhile rallied with investors looking past a downgrade of US growth to focus on the next round of top-level China-US trade talks. Although equities have been dogged by fears over the outlook for the economy markets have enjoyed a stellar first-quarter overall mostly on hopes of a US-China tariffs deal and the prospect of lower borrowing costs. European stocks were solidly higher by the mid-afternoon while Wall Street was also firmly in the black in the late New York morning. In commodities oil prices were headed for a strong finish to the week having enjoyed their best quarter in 14 years with Brent crude jumping 26 per cent and WTI by 29 per cent since the start of the year on tighter supplies. US President Donald Trump on Thursday called on Opec to boost oil output following the price rises since the beginning of 2019. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in December reached a deal with Russia and some other non-cartel producers to limit output to shore up prices. “While Opec and above all (kingpin member) Saudi Arabia appeared in November to be obeying US President Trump’s repeated demands to increase oil production his tweets now are more likely to fall on deaf ears” analysts at Commerzbank said yesterday. Oil futures have won support also from unrest in OPEC-member Venezuela. “US sanctions power outages and mismanagement are having a massive effect on Venezuela’s oil production and oil exports at present” they added in a research note.

The British pound crumbled yesterday after London requested another extension in the long-running Brexit saga while global stocks were having a humdrum day enlivened only by hopes over China-US trade talks. British Prime Minister Theresa May has asked the European Union to delay Britain’s departure until June 30 while the bloc itself suggested that it might be best to postpone the split for up to a year. As so often before sheer uncertainty over Britain’s future weighed on sterling but the currency’s downside was limited by expectations that the exit from the EU will be softened by some kind of agreement with the bloc. “As far as most currency traders are concerned the chances of a no-deal remain remote – but at the same time a satisfactory outcome anytime soon also seems highly unlikely” said XTB analyst David Cheetham yesterday. Ms May also told EU Council president Donald Tusk in a formal letter that Britain would start preparing for its participation in European Parliament elections in case it is still a member of the bloc when they begin on May 23. The embattled premier is racing against the clock in a desperate bid to get her deal approved in time for an EU leaders’ summit in Brussels on Wednesday when a formal decision on any extension will be made. She is also holding a third day of delicate talks with Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to find a way to avert a messy no-deal divorce. The Brexit current deadline is April 12 which has already been pushed back once from March 29. In stock market deals London gained as the pound weakened while neither Paris and Frankfurt had much to show for the day's trading. On Wall Street the Dow Jones index rose after the government reported jobs numbers for March well above expectations a sign of a robust economy that was greeted with much relief after weak numbers a month earlier. “After disappointment in February job creation bounced back nicely in March” ING chief international economist James Knightley said. Asian equity indices mostly rose in holiday-thinned trade on hopes that China and the United States will hammer out a trade deal after both sides sounded notes of optimism. With top negotiators from the world’s top two economies huddled down in Washington for three days of talks there has been a growing sense they are close to an agreement to end a stand-off that battered global equities last year. US President Donald Trump added to the sense of hope earlier this week when he said the two sides were nearing a successful conclusion. “We will probably know over the next four weeks. It may take two weeks after that” he told reporters after a meeting with Beijing’s vice premier Liu He. “It’s looking very good.” MEP elections: What are the odds Labour win again?

The Maltese government is conducting studies on how Malta could be affected if Britain were to leave the EU Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said in parliament this evening. Replying to Opposition questions after a statement on last weekend's EU summit and the deal reached with the UK ahead of the in-out referendum Dr Muscat said there could be both positive and negative impacts but ultimately it would be better for Malta if the UK stayed in the EU not least as the UK was an important trading partner\\xa0 The sector most affected by Brexit would be financial services. On the one hand there could be a situation of Malta attracting business from London because Malta could offer passporting within the EU for financial services. The disadvantage was that the City of London could introduce new conditions which would make it more attractive as a financial jurisdiction. Politically Dr Muscat said it would be better if the UK stayed in the EU because the UK was a counter-balance for of the move towards greater federalism in the EU in areas such as tax harmonisation. In the talks and the eventual deal with the EU Malta and Luxembourg made it clear that interpretation of the rules was such that there would not be a different sets of rules for those in the EU and in the eurozone and those who were in the EU but not the Eurozone.\\xa0 Dr Muscat said the issues raised by the UK about social benefits for workers who migrated from other EU countries did not affect Malta since its situation was different. However should there be a situation where the presence of EU migrant workers put pressure on the Malta government financial sector Malta would apply the same mechanism allowed for the UK. \\xa0 As for Maltese living in the UK Dr Muscat said that if the UK left the EU existing bilateral social security and health agreements would apply.\\xa0 Dr Muscat also replied to a number of questions on migration confirming that Malta had received the names of migrants which would be brought to Malta under the burden sharing arrangement. Final arrangements were still being made such as how these migrants would be received with dignity. He said the ongoing discussion in the EU was among other things was on ways to ensure that such migrants after they were resettled in various countries did not pack their bags and move on to other countries.\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: UK Parliament via Reuters TV  Exiting the European Union could hurt Britain’s $2.9 trillion economy and prompt some banks to abandon London’s global financial powerhouse Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said yesterday. In his strongest intervention so far in Britain’s debate about EU membership Carney said he was not making any recommendation about how to vote in the June 23 referendum but that uncertainty created by an exit could hurt the economy. Asked about the implications of an exit for Britain’s huge banking industry he said some major financial institutions were considering a possible move if the country voted to leave the EU. “One would expect some activity to move” Carney told lawmakers in the British parliament. “I’d say a number of institutions are contingency planning for that possibility.” After clinching a deal from other EU leaders last month in Brussels Prime Minister David Cameron asked the central bank which is independent from the government to set out the facts about membership. Though Carney also said there were risks from remaining inside the EU due to the greater integration planned by the 19-member eurozone he praised Cameron’s deal. One would expect some activity to move “The settlement addresses the issues the bank identified as being important given the likely need for further integration of the eurozone to maintaining its ability to achieve its objectives” Carney a Canadian said in a letter to British lawmakers. Adding caveats to many of his assessments Carney said the BoE was not taking a view on the long-term implications for Britain’s economy of a Brexit as leaving is known but there could be a short-term hit to growth if the country decides to leave the bloc. “There could be lower levels of activity because of the degree of uncertainty that could affect investment and household spending” Carney told a parliamentary committee. Under questioning by lawmakers Carney came in for harsh criticism from one eurosceptic member of Cameron’s party for a BoE report published in October which gave a positive assessment of Britain’s membership of the EU. Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was “beneath the dignity” of the BoE to make “speculative” comments about the benefits of EU membership. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Russell Cheyne/Reuters  Leaving the European Union will sap Scotland’s economy by between £1.7 and 11.2 billion by 2030 the Scottish government has said. Presenting the figures Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was seeking “in good faith” to negotiate the Scottish chapter of the terms under which Britain leaves the EU but would keep Scottish independence from the UK as an option. “The old argument that the UK somehow delivers financial security for Scotland no longer holds water” she told a news conference. The economic estimates were based on studies by think-tanks and Britain’s finance ministry looking at the different trade agreements Britain might select after its vote to leave the EU as well as the uncertainty facing the economy until its choice is clear. “Pursuing an option short of full EU membership risks damaging Scottish exports makes the country a less attractive location for overseas investors and reduces future economic growth and prosperity” the Scottish government said. Sturgeon has vowed to seek ways to keep Scotland’s EU membership. Scotland – one of the four constituent nations of the United Kingdom – voted to remain by 62 to 38 per cent. Researchers from the University of Strathclyde’s Fraser of Allander Institute have revised down their forecasts for Scottish gross domestic product growth in 2017 to 0.5 per cent from 1.9 per cent after the referendum result. The first official data covering the post-referendum period showed no immediate big hit to Britain’s economy as retail sales surged in July and claims for unemployment benefits fell. But economists expect rising inflation from a weak pound and worsening business confidence in the coming months. Sturgeon is not ruling out another Scottish independence referendum as part of its efforts to keep Scotland in the EU although independence was not mentioned in its summary of the risks to the Scottish economy of the EU vote. The timing of a new independence vote however would hinge on when the UK’s Brexit position becomes clear she told reporters. Furthermore Scotland voted to stay part of the UK by 55 to 45 in 2014. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britons still undecided on how they will vote in a referendum on EU membership think they would be 71 pounds a year worse off if Britain quits the bloc a survey said suggesting the \"Leave\" camp faces a bigger challenge than the \"Remain\" side. Undecided voters on average estimated that households would be 181 pounds worse off per annum five years after a vote to leave the EU compared with a hit of 110 pounds if Britain decided to stay the survey showed. Eighteen percent of the 3000 respondents polled by market research firm Opinium and the European Centre for Research in Electoral Psychology at the London School of Economics said they did not know how they would vote in the June 23 referendum. A quarter of those who have not made up their minds think that British households will be worse off after a vote to leave compared with 17 percent who think they would be worse off if Britain stays in the bloc the poll showed. Polls on how Britons will vote in two weeks\\' time are too close to call. The \"Leave\" camp edged ahead in two polls on Monday only for two separate polls to put \"Remain\" narrowly ahead hours later. Thursday\\'s survey also found voters were split evenly although no detailed breakdown was provided. It suggested voters across the board were more sceptical about the \"Leave\" camp\\'s arguments. Respondents thought immigration would remain a challenge even after Brexit and the EU would be unlikely to offer Britain a better deal if it left. Opinium and the ECREP gave no definition of such a deal. \"Unless \\'Vote Leave\\' can find more believable messages for those sitting on the fence the large number making their final decision at the last moment could tip the scales in favour of Remain\" Opinium managing director James Endersby said. Voters were also sceptical about some arguments put forward by the \"Remain\" campaign including suggestions that major banks would leave London if Britain quits th) e EU. The poll found up to 30 percent of voters could make up or change their mind on how to vote in the last week of the campaign and half of them could do so on polling day itself. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Jon Nazca/Reuters  Britain’s vote to leave the EU could be significantly negative for the eurozone dampening a growth outlook that is already facing headwinds the European Central Bank said in the minutes of its June 2 meeting held before the referendum. Growth is being hampered by a weak external environment particularly in emerging markets and continued deleveraging by eurozone companies and risks remain tilted to the downside policymakers concluded. “In the event that the UK voted to leave i.e. a ‘Brexit’ there could be significant although difficult to anticipate negative spillovers to the eurozone via a number of channels including trade and the financial markets” the ECB said. Britons voted to leave the EU in a June 23 referendum. The ECB said time would be needed to see the full effect of its already unveiled but not yet implemented policy-easing measures particularly its corporate bond buys and a fresh round of cheap loans. Its cautious tone was similar to that of the Federal Reserve which said on Wednesday that it would keep interest rates firmly on hold until it got a handle on the consequences of Britain’s vote to leave the EU. For the ECB one of the most pressing issues may be the investor flight to top-rated government debt seen after the referendum which reduces the availability of bonds to purchase as part of its €1.74 trillion quantitative easing scheme. Nearly a third of eurozone government bonds are no longer eligible for the asset- buying scheme because they yield less than the bank’s -0.4 per cent deposit rate Tradeweb data showed yesterday. The ECB said a remark was made at the June meeting that markets see a future challenge in sourcing sufficient volumes of debt to buy possibly leading to increased price volatility. Although the ECB can substitute assets if it cannot buy enough government debt investors remained closely tied to specific market segments so that the actual composition of purchases still mattered the ECB added. Some analysts predict the bank will not have enough German Irish and Portuguese bonds to buy due to its self-imposed limits forcing the ECB to tweak some of its rules if it wants to maintain monthly purchases at €80 billion per month until March when the scheme is due to run out. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Stalemate between Britain and the European Union over what happens next following Britons\\' referendum vote to leave has opened up a host of possible scenarios. Here are some that are (in some cases barely) conceivable: \\xa0 1. BY THE BOOK Prime Minister David Cameron who said he will resign after losing his gamble to end British ambivalence about staying in agrees with the EU establishment that the only legal way to leave is to use Article 50 of the EU\\'s Lisbon Treaty to negotiate a withdrawal. He wants to leave triggering the process to his successor who may not be chosen by the Conservative party until October. EU leaders want him to do it now or at least as soon as possible but they lack the legal power to force him. In the most amicable divorce scenario Britain would trigger Article 50 possibly (though unlikely now) as early as Tuesday when Cameron meets the other 27 EU leaders at a Brussels summit or via a formal letter later from Cameron or his successor. That sets a two-year time limit on negotiating an amicable withdrawal. Ideally it would divide up assets and liabilities in the shared EU budget and other priority business such as perhaps the status of British and other EU citizens who find themselves living on the wrong side of a hard new UK-EU border. In an even more ideal world it would set out a new close economic relationship between Britain and the EU possibly in a separate parallel treaty taking effect from the exit date. The withdrawal treaty can be enacted by just 20 of the 27 other states representing 65 percent of the remaining population. A full new relationship would probably need unanimous support. Two years is very tight but the negotiations can be extended if all 28 countries agree. If there is no deal then Britain is simply out of the EU two years after Article 50 was triggered -- an outcome written in to the treaty to limit uncertainties. REALLY? TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. THE EU IS NEVER THIS EASY \\xa0 2. SORRY WE DIDN\\'T MEAN IT Britain is in political meltdown with both main parties in civil war and pro-EU Scotland threatening to either block Brexit legally (unclear how) or break away. The referendum result is not constitutionally binding and government and parliament maybe after a new election could just ignore it. If so the EU would carry on as before but a special membership deal it gave Cameron in February has been killed by the referendum result. REALLY? PUSHES DEMOCRATIC CREDIBILITY BEYOND BREAKING POINT \\xa0 3. WE MEAN IT BUT NOT YET Brexit campaigners have long been suspicious of the two-year limit in Article 50 and some have explicitly said it should only formally be triggered AFTER they have agreed a comprehensive free trade deal that relieves Britain of EU rules such as open EU immigration. Five years or more is the norm globally for such big trade deals. Britain would be a full EU member until then. That is a nightmare scenario for EU leaders plunging the bloc into open-ended negotiations with its second biggest power that would inspire eurosceptics across the bloc to emulate it and distract governments from other pressing European issues. They rule out opening any negotiation until Britain binds itself to the timetable set out in Article 50. And they insist Britain cannot have its cake on market access and still eat it by ending EU budget payments and free movement of workers. In theory there could be an endless standoff with Britain the sulky teenager at the table poisoning the atmosphere next year as France and Germany run elections and the EU starts confrontational talks on a new 7-year budget. Something would have to give and some compromise would start to be worked out. REALLY? COMPROMISE IS THE EU WAY; DON\\'T RULE THIS OUT \\xa0 4. WE MEAN IT -- OR MAYBE WE DIDN\\'T Article 50 suggests a one-way exit rather than a revolving door. EU officials insist that once triggered a state cannot back out and stay. It is not entirely clear however. Could a future British government conclude that the best settlement to divorce proceedings is just to stay married if others agree? REALLY? SEE SCENARIO 2 BUT WITH ADDED FADING OF MEMORIES \\xa0 5. CAN WE JUST TWEAK THIS QUICKLY? Some Brexit campaigners have suggested that the Leave vote simply serve as leverage to renegotiate better semi-detached terms for Britain inside the EU which could be put to another referendum. EU leaders have ruled that out on the same grounds as above that \"cherry picking\" will spread and wreck the Union. Cameron\\'s deal to protect the City of London from the euro zone and curb EU immigration has been killed by a clause that linked it to last week\\'s referendum result. So any talks would start from a lower base and EU leaders would have to eat their words. But some kind of \"associate membership\" or \"special partnership\" has been around as an idea in Europe for a time. REALLY? SEE 4 BUT NEVER SAY NEVER IN EURO-COMPROMISE LAND \\xa0 6. LET\\'S JUST SLIP INTO SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE Britain could try to join the European Economic Area or European Free Trade Association joining the likes of Norway Switzerland or Iceland in close partnerships with the EU. That could fly with the EU but British leaders would have to persuade Brexit voters to agree to the EU budget contributions and migrants that are accepted by some of those countries. It also would lack the kind of EU market access for services trade which is so important to Britain\\'s big financial sector. A more tailor-made deal would bring things back to earlier scenarios. REALLY? DOESN\\'T SEEM TO BE WHAT BRITONS WANT AT LEAST NOW \\xa0 7. WHY DON\\'T WE START AGAIN? One extreme view is that the fallout from Brexit in the EU might be so cataclysmic that Europeans would go back to the drawing board and effectively create a new kind of Union that could include Britain. Marshalling disparate national ambitions into a new structure would be a colossal task not least in the wake of the bitterness that the current crisis has engendered. REALLY? A DEFINITE LONG SHOT NOT ONE FOR THE NEAR FUTURE \\xa0 8. SECOND TIME LUCKY? Some people who voted to Leave have said that if it doesn\\'t work outside Britain could always join the EU again. That is true though it would get no favours. It would face a years-long accession process and require unanimous acceptance by existing members and have to accept a host of conditions that Britain has opted out of during its past 43 years -- notably adopting the euro and a virtually 50-percent rebate on EU membership fees. REALLY? ONE FOR THE (VERY LONG-LIVED) BIRDS \\xa0 9. ROOM FOR A LITTLE ONE? Some Scots hope to avoid Brexit by breaking from England. An idea that an independent Scotland could somehow simply sit in the vacant UK chair in Brussels is dismissed by EU officials. At the time of the 2014 independence referendum the EU said Scotland could apply for membership but would go to the \"back of the queue\" behind the likes of Serbia and that its hope of keeping the pound rather than the euro was a non-starter. There is some sympathy for Scots losing their place in the EU but also deep suspicion of secession especially in Spain Belgium and Italy which have their own separatist problems. And a veto. REALLY? NOT SOON BUT SCOTLAND COULD JOIN THE EU ONE DAY \\xa0 10. SLAMMING THE DOOR A new British government simply walks out. It could launch Article 50 and leave legally in 2019 without any negotiation. It could also ignore the two-year notice period and tear up its treaty obligations and quit right away though that would undermine its credibility as a party to international law. There is however nothing the EU can do to prevent that. It could retaliate on trade or against Britons living in the EU however much that would create a painful tit-for-tat that would badly hurt Europe\\'s economy and citizens. Nonetheless EU leaders fear that letting Brexit Britain walk all over them will only inspire other European nationalists to destroy the Union. REALLY? THREAT OF MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION THEN DETENTE? \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

While gamblers staking money on the outcome of the EU referendum will either be scouring for their winning tickets or tearing the worthless betting slip into several pieces one punter in particular will have double cause for celebration when he collects his winnings. Ukip leader Nigel Farage who helped steer Leave campaigners to an unlikely victory also won £2500 after placing a £1000 bet on a Brexit verdict earlier in the month. And bookies said they will be trying to identify how they got the odds so wrong - backing a Remain vote right up until the close of voting yesterday with odds of 3/10. A Ladbrokes spokesman said: \"Naturally there will be far more important implications of this referendum than those affecting the political betting community. But those of us who do this for a living have to face up to some tough questions today. \"A Remain verdict was rated about a 90% certainty as the polls closed.\" Ladbrokes said the majority of players in the market were backing Leave. As polls closed Betfair put the odds of staying at 2/13 or 86% while William Hill said Remain was its 2/9 favourite equating to an 81% chance. Bookies said they expect the EU referendum to be the most gambled upon political event in British betting history - beating the record set by the Scottish independence referendum. William Hill spokesman Graeme Sharpe said there was a long history of betting on the referendum dating back three years. But he also said one customer bet in the early hours of Friday - moments before the result was announced - to win £1 off a £100 stake. And there were also some big losers on the night. Mr Sharpe said one Remain punter lost £100000 while others lost figures of £60000 £40000 £25000 and £20000. Mr Sharpe said the oldest client to bet was an online customer aged 101 who bet £10 at 11/4 and won £27.50. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters  Atlanta Federal Reserve president Dennis Lockhart said that Britain’s vote on whether to stay in the European Union could “loom large” as the US central bank contemplates whether to raise interest rates at its next policy meeting. “Brexit could be a source of heightened global uncertainty” Lockhart said in a speech before the World Affairs Council of Jacksonville Florida adding it “has some potential to loom large as we approach the June meeting.” Earlier in the day Lockhart also flagged risks to the US economy posed by Britain’s referendum on EU membership which takes place a week after the Fed next meets on June 14-15. Fed policymakers in March forecast two rate rises this year but there was little sign in their latest policy statement last week of any hurry to raise rates again amid slowing global growth and tepid inflation at home. However San Francisco Fed president John Williams said on Tuesday that he would support an interest rate hike in June as long as he sees continued progress on the economy inflation and jobs. The Fed raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade in December. Investors currently see the Fed raising rates again in December and little chance of a June hike according to an analysis of Fed Fund futures by the CME Group. Lockhart said that he is worried that lacklustre US first-quarter gross domestic product growth “turns out in fact to be persistent” and is currently ambivalent on whether the US central bank should raise rates in June. In comments to reporters after his speech Lockhart added he did not think the economy is at risk of overheating or that the Fed may be behind the curve on inflation. Political uncertainty may also be affecting business investment and consumer spending he said. The US economy has been sending mixed signals since the start of the year he noted with solid consumer fundamentals not showing through in domestic demand data and wage growth still tepid. That said Lockhart added that for the time being he favoured strong jobs gains over the growth data as the more reliable signal of the health of the US economy. Separate manufacturing data from China and Britain on Tuesday rekindled fears over the pace of the global slowdown sending US stocks lower. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

World stocks rose as a breakthrough in Brexit negotiations added momentum to an upswing underpinned by strong economic news from China and Japan. Britain and the European Union struck a deal yesterday to move on to talk about trade and a transition period after they agreed the outline of their divorce deal. Shares across the continent surged on the news and even Britain’s FTSE 100 Index which tends to move inversely with sterling was higher through the day despite an early rally for the British currency. At one stage sterling gained half a per cent to hit a six-month high of 86.9 pence against the euro but this completely reversed as the session went on. The pan-European share index rose 0.8 per cent pushing the MSCI world equity index which tracks shares in 47 countries up 0.2 per cent. European banking shares were among the biggest gainers after financial regulators reached a long-sought deal on Thursday to harmonise global banking rules but said the rules would take effect in 2022 later than previous expectations for 2019. The dollar had risen earlier in the session but retraced a touch after the release of US payroll data. Job growth in the world’s biggest economy increased at a strong clip in November but wage growth was a touch lower than expected. The yield on 10-year US Treasuries also dipped slightly before rising again on this mixed picture. Yesterday Asian shares rallied for a second session in a row as economic news from China and Japan beat all expectations. Beijing reported exports surged 12.3 per cent in November from a year earlier more than double the forecast while imports climbed almost 18 per cent. Iron ore and copper imports enjoyed a stellar rebound which could help stem a recent pullback in commodity prices. Japan’s Nikkei led the way as the yen eased on the dollar rising 1.1 per cent on top of Thursday’s 1.45 per cent bounce to be almost back where it started the week. Gold inched up to $1247.40 having this week breached its recent tight trading range to hit a four-month trough at $1245.60. Oil prices rose helped by rising Chinese demand. Brent futures were up 0.7 per cent at $62.91 a barrel having climbed 98 cents overnight. United States crude was up 71 cents at $57.40. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

European Union attempts to supervise American financial firms as a condition of access to the bloc\\'s markets would be firmly rejected a top US securities exchange official said on Tuesday. Mark Hemsley president of the European arm of US exchange CBOE said EU regulators were trying to map out future working relations with their UK counterparts after Britain leaves the bloc next March. Brussels has proposed joint supervision of foreign clearing houses that want access to EU customers - or else clearing in euro-denominated contracts currently dominated by LCH in London must relocate to the bloc. This has raised concerns among regulators in the United States where clearing houses handle dollar-denominated transactions for EU customers. Hemsley president of CBOE Europe the region\\'s biggest pan-European share trading platform and based in London said the bloc must tread carefully. Britain may take some elements of information sharing and cross supervision with EU regulators to win the \"prize\" of continued access to Europe and European firms having access to the Britain he said. \"But they have got to do that in a way that doesn\\'t mean that the European regulators are going to try and regulate the DTCC or CBOE US or CME because US firms and regulators will say \\'go jump it\\'s not going to happen\\'\" he told the annual FIA IDX derivatives conference. The EU grants financial market access if it deems a foreign or \"third country\" firm is complying with rules that are strict as those enforced in the bloc. Brexit has prompted the bloc to review its equivalence regime as it was not intended for a foreign global financial centre on its doorstep as London will become after next March. \"That\\'s the framework they are trying to work out. How do you manage a big third country without trying to reach into things which will never happen like regulating Japan regulating the US\" Hemsley said. \"Then you\\'ve got Switzerland which is going to be probably a receiver in whatever happens in the UK environment.\" The EU\\'s euro clearing draft law builds on its equivalence system by including on-going supervision. France is also calling for much tougher equivalence conditions for foreign investment banks and trading platforms that want to trade securities on behalf of EU customers. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The former prime minister said the public should be allowed to \"think again\" in a fresh vote to decide Britain\\'s future relationship with the bloc. Mr Blair insisted there was \"little doubt that Brexit is causing economic difficulty\" but said it was not the only reason for allowing \"the right for people to think again\". He told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"You could have an election on the issue.\" The former Labour leader said he \"accepted entirely\" the result of the referendum but insisted \"democracy doesn\\'t just stop on one day\". \"I\\'m simply saying one very very simple thing which is that in 2016 you knew you wanted to get out of the European Union but you didn\\'t see the terms of the alternative relationship. The former Labour leader said he \"accepted entirely\" the result of the referendum but insisted \"democracy doesn\\'t just stop on one day\". \"If when you see those terms you think it is better to stick with Europe you are entitled to have that say.\" Mr Blair said whether voters were given a say through an election or referendum was a second order problem. In an interview peppered with interruptions as John Humphrys challenged the former PM on his claims Mr Blair urged the presenter to \"let me finish\" and \"let me just explain\" his case. In robust exchanges Mr Humphrys told Mr Blair he was \"conflating two different things\" when he said the NHS was facing pressures because of Brexit. But Mr Blair insisted health service staff were leaving as a result of Brexit and the government was not able to focus on the problems in the NHS because its focus was on preparing for exit from the bloc. \"Brexit has a massive distractive impact on dealing with the actual challenges of the country and you can see this so clearly with the National Health Service\" Mr Blair said. The former PM accused Labour of timidity on Brexit Mr Blair dismissed claims he was pushing the case for the elite telling the programme: \"There are elites on both sides of the argument.\" It comes after the former PM accused Labour of timidity on Brexit and urged the party he once led to instead \"make Brexit the Tory Brexit\". Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: \"This intervention shows there is growing support for giving people a vote on the final Brexit deal. \"With the NHS in crisis and the promised £350 million a week nowhere to be seen the case for an exit from Brexit is growing stronger each day. \"The Labour leadership needs to stop being complicit in a botched Conservative Brexit or they will pay the price at the next election.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Toby Melville/Reuters  The European Union’s market watchdog is investigating ways to stop national regulators competing unfairly with each other as they try to attract firms from Britain after Brexit in a beauty parade of financial centres. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) told Reuters it is studying the risk of “regulatory arbitrage” – where some EU states might offer financial firms lighter supervision than other member states in return for the jobs and high tax revenue they would bring. While the issue concerns business coming from any non-EU country ESMA’s move is an early sign of how some regulators believe there may be a particular need for precautionary measures for when Britain leaves the bloc. Regulators in a number of EU countries have made clear they will not tolerate “brass plate” arrangements where business is officially routed through an office in a member state but senior executives and IT systems remain in London Europe’s dominant financial centre. However the risk is that some EU states might be tempted to break ranks and allow such front operations after Brexit. The issue is particularly likely to affect asset management; Britain is the second largest centre for this after the United States managing £5.7 trillion on behalf of clients many of them in continental Europe. Financial firms in the UK worried they will lose access to the bloc’s capital market are deciding whether to move some operations and staff to new bases on the continent or in Ireland. Looking at issues around outsourcing and delegation Frankfurt Paris Luxembourg and Dublin are vying to attract banks market infrastructure firms insurers or asset managers. A spokesman for Paris-based ESMA said its inquiries concerned issues that a national regulator in the EU may face when financial firms from another country show an interest or make an application for a licence. “It is not focused on efficiency issues of different financial centres but rather looking at issues around outsourcing and delegation which could lead to regulatory arbitrage” an ESMA spokesman said. Furthermore outsourcing and delegation refers to when key functions of operations in an EU state are being carried out in a country outside the bloc for instance in fund management. Worries could centre around for example a firm being granted a licence to operate a subsidiary in an EU country but being allowed to run much of unit’s operations from its office in Britain. EU rules require safeguards to ensure the continuity of good service and clear lines of management responsibilities. Financial watchdogs have told banks they will have to have a certain amount of capital senior staff on the ground and approved risk models to get a licence to operate across the EU. The European Central Bank has considerable powers to clamp down as it must first grant the licence for say a London-based bank that wants to move operations to Frankfurt. This is not necessarily the case in other areas like markets which lack such powerful pan-European regulators. A financial industry official in London said that it made sense to have some sort of common approach among regulators across the EU for the authorisation of new firms. “But ESMA is hamstrung as they can only provide a non-legally binding recommendation which the national regulators can freely ignore” the official said. Discussions of Brexit-related moves are already well underway. Hiscox an insurance underwriter in London said last Monday it was in talks with regulators in Luxembourg and Malta about setting up a new insurance base in one of the countries. Lloyd’s of London the insurance market that Hiscox trades on has also looked at several locations for a new EU unit. Andreas Dombret a Bundesbank board member said last week that regulators must not try to undercut each other by offering firms “discounts” or incentives to relocate operations and staff to their financial centre. “There are market participants talking about this I don’t have any direct evidence” Dombret said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Reuters/Darren Staples  Both sides in Britain\\'s referendum on whether to stay in the European Union should agree an \"amnesty\" on misleading and bogus claims a parliamentary report said today. The report from the Treasury Select Committee reached no conclusion on the costs and benefits of EU membership or which way people should vote on June 23. \"The arms race of ever more lurid claims and counter-claims made by both the Leave and Remain sides is not just confusing the public\" the committee\\'s chairman Andrew Tyrie said in a statement. \"It is impoverishing political debate.\" He added: \"Today is the first day of the main campaign. It needs to begin with an amnesty on misleading and at times bogus claims. The public are thoroughly fed up with them. The public are right.\" The \"Vote Leave\" campaign has said that leaving the EU would save Britain 350 million pounds (€460 million) a week money that could be spent on hospitals and schools. This was \"highly misleading\" the report said. Meanwhile those backing continued membership of the EU had created the \"mistaken impression\" that 3 million jobs were dependent on staying in the bloc. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

He is expected to use the potentially awkward meeting to urge the other 27 leaders and EU institutions to take a \"constructive\" approach to negotiations over a new relationship with the UK. But he will resist pressure for an early start to the two-year talks process insisting that it is a matter for his successor as PM to decide when to issue formal notification of Britain\\'s intention to leave the EU under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Despite calls for an \"immediate\" move to withdrawal negotiations from European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker the new PM may not be in place until as late as September 2. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has suggested Britain could hold another vote on the leaving the EU. The next Prime Minister should be allowed to \"negotiate a deal\" with Brussels that the public can have a say on through a second referendum or a general election he said. In an article for The Daily Telegraph he said: \"We must not invoke Article 50 straight away because that puts a time limit of two years on negotiations after which we could be thrown out with no deal at all. So before setting the clock ticking we need to negotiate a deal and put it to the British people either in a referendum or through the Conservative manifesto at a fresh general election.\"  Mr Cameron will attend a working dinner devoted to the consequences of the referendum vote which has sent shockwaves through Europe\\'s political establishment and sent stock markets tumbling across the continent. But he has not been invited to the second day of the summit when the other 27 leaders will hold informal discussions on the stance the EU should take towards the UK\\'s demands. Brexit standard-bearer and bookies\\' favourite as next PM Boris Johnson said yesterday he expected Britain to be able to impose points-based controls on EU migrants coming to the UK while retaining the right for its own citizens to work and settle elsewhere in Europe and to access the single market. His proposal for informal talks to sketch out a blueprint for future UK/EU relations before the invocation of Article 50 were rebuffed by leaders of Germany France and Italy who said there would be no negotiations \"before an application for exiting the EU has been submitted to the European Council\". BRITAIN DOWNGRADED The summit comes a day after ratings agency Standard & Poor\\'s downgraded the UK by two notches from its top AAA grade to AA warning that victory for Leave had led to \"a less predictable stable and effective policy framework\". A Government source said Mr Cameron would use the meeting to \"encourage people to think about how the UK and EU make the best of the decision of the British people\". He will make the point that until the withdrawal negotiations are complete the UK remains a full member of the EU entitled to the full rights of membership. After telling the House of Commons on Monday that it was vital for Britain to maintain the \"strongest possible\" economic links with the EU Mr Cameron will tell fellow leaders that a good economic relationship is in the interests not only of the UK but of all the remaining member states. The source dismissed suggestions that Mr Cameron\\'s exclusion from tomorrow\\'s meeting amounts to a snub saying: \"We respect their right to have these discussions.\" MEPs were due to discuss the fallout from the referendum in a special session of the European Parliament in Brussels. Business Secretary Sajid Javid will hold a round table discussion with industry figures over the impact Brexit will have on their companies and sectors. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 5th 12:55  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Britain’s 2.2 million financial industry workers face uncertainty and the risk of thousands of job cuts after the country voted to quit the EU leaving doubts over London’s status as Europe’s premier financial centre. The ‘Leave’ campaign fronted by a slew of Conservative MPs and financial industry veterans won over its ‘Britain Stronger in Europe’ rival after 52 per cent of Britons voted to leave the 28-nation club. A morning of triumph and jubilation for the Brexit camp has been overshadowed by an average 13.4 per cent fall in the share prices of the top five British banks and slides of 12 to 14 per cent in elite wealth managers Schroders Aberdeen Asset Management and St James’s Place. European bank shares also tumbled more than 13 per cent roughly twice as steep a fall as seen among big companies with lenders in Italy and Greece hard hit. A leave vote means the future of Britain’s financial services industry now hangs in the balance. All depends on the divorce between Europe and Britain the latter’s ability to retain access to the European free market and cope with the volatility that has seen sterling nosedive against major currencies. The mood in the high-rise banking hub of Canary Wharf home to JPMorgan HSBC and Barclays was sober and contemplative with job security fears rising to levels unseen since the 2008 financial crisis. Investment banks have already warned they could move thousands of jobs if Britain opts out of the EU while the European Central Bank has signalled it could force euro trading out of London the world’s largest foreign exchange market. But some sought to play down fears of a catastrophic hit to Britain’s banking sector pointing to extensive contingency planning and years of experience navigating crisis. Jes Staley CEO of Barclays – which suffered the biggest one-day fall in its share price on record on Friday – said the bank had a history of adapting to change and would work with authorities as the terms of the exit become clear. HSBC chairman Douglas Flint said the day marked a new era for Britain and British business describing work to establish fresh terms of trade with European and global part\\xadners “as complex and time consuming”. Jamie Dimon CEO of rival JPMorgan told staffers his bank “may need to make changes to our European legal entity structure and the location of some roles to comply with new laws as we serve our clients around the world” casting a pall over its 16000 strong workforce. But the City of London Corporation which oversees the capital’s financial district said the leave vote should not lead to a major exodus. “There will be no mass exit of banks and financial institutions from the Square Mile” said Mark Boleat policy chairman for the City of London Corporation. “The general view of the City is that the government should push for the UK to retain our access to the single market.” The British Bankers’ Association chief executive Anthony Browne moved to reassure people that banks across the country would be operating as normal on Friday. “People will be able to take money out of cash machines” he said. Months of bitter campaigning has left the industry – which earned £190 billion in 2014 – divided with investment banks and insurers pitted against many fund managers and brokers who wanted a Brexit. Property investor Richard Tice a co-founder of Leave.eu and one of the few prominent City figures in favour of leaving told Reuters he cried tears of happiness after the vote. “There is huge joy delight and pride. We have changed the course of history in the UK. It is very simple everyone needs to calm down and do what we do well which is working and playing hard.” But there was little of that joy in trading rooms. Sterling fell to its lowest level since 1985 the year before Britain’s deregulation of financial markets that helped propel the City of London into one of the world’s major financial centres in the so-called ‘Big Bang’. All the major international and British banks in London had traders either working through the night or on call. European government officials had said UK-based firms could lose privileges after Brexit a move that could prompt banks to shift some operations to Frankfurt Paris or Dublin to serve EU clients. The Bank of England said it had made contingency plans and will take steps to meet its responsibilities for financial stability in conjunction with domestic authorities and overseas central banks. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The European Union’s financial markets “coped well” with fallout from Britain’s decision last week to leave the bloc with no extraordinary measures needed by regulators the EU’s top securities watchdog said yesterday. Markets fell sharply last Friday on the outcome of Britain’s referendum on EU membership with bank shares plunging and sterling hitting its lowest level in three decades. There was no need to use their powers on Friday “The market infrastructure has coped well with the impact and that was not a reason to have any extraordinary measures” Steven Maijoor chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority told a Politico event in London. The role of markets was to adjust values of assets and it was important to allow it to do this Maijoor said. ESMA and national regulators coordinated in advance and decided there was no need to use their powers on Friday such as imposing short-selling bans he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Shutterstock.  Any British shoppers tempted by Apple’s new iPhone are having to dig deeper into their pockets after June’s Brexit vote as the US tech giant raised the sterling price by £60 (€66.81) when the model went on sale last month. While US customers will pay the same as last year the 11 per cent price rise for Britons from the previous model almost exactly matches the amount by which the pound had fallen against the dollar since the vote to leave the European Union. Last week sterling slid to a new 31-year low meaning many other retailers are likely to follow Apple putting a dampener on five years of solid growth in consumer spending that has powered Britain’s recovery since the financial crisis. But few consumers seem aware of what is coming according to one survey of household expectations. Higher inflation – along with a rise in unemployment and slower wage growth – could reduce growth in household spending to just one per cent next year the Bank of England (BoE) has said. That would be just one-third of its pace in the past year. “We know there is a big inflation shock coming from sterling’s depreciation so it looks like households’ real income will grow only very modestly next year” said Samuel Tombs chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Even before the referendum households had seen disposable income grow more slowly and they were saving the smallest percentage of income since 2008 to bridge the gap. The question now is how rapidly other retailers follow Apple and raise prices. So far the picture is mixed. Associated British Foods which owns discount clothing retailer Primark told Reuters it intended to absorb the higher cost of imports through its profit margins to maintain its position as a bargain destination. By contrast fashion chain Next said it would pass on higher costs to consumers but not until the spring of 2017 when hedges it took out against currency weakness expire. Next – one of Britain’s biggest clothing retailers – has estimated that the weaker pound will push up its costs by five per cent next year if it cannot find cheaper suppliers. Based on its experience in 2010 after sterling’s last big fall passing a five per cent price rise on to shoppers would reduce the volume of sales by 5.5 per cent – but lower revenue by just 0.5 to 1.0 per cent. “In the scheme of things we think that this drag on sales is manageable and less damaging than taking a significant hit to margin” Next told investors. Sentiment is likely to dip again negatively impacting retail spending Firms across Britain will have to make similar choices. The average cost of imported goods in August was 7.6 per cent higher than a year earlier the sharpest year-on-year rise since 2011. The BoE estimates about 60 per cent of cost increases caused by a weaker currency are passed on to consumers although there are exceptions in highly price-sensitive sectors. Grocery prices for example have fallen over the past two years as the four main supermarket chains – Tesco Sainsbury’s Asda and Morrisons – compete against German discounters Aldi and Lidl. None is likely to want to be the first to break ranks and raise prices. Sainsbury’s has said lower global commodity prices mean prices might not rise at all although last Wednesday bakery chain Greggs said it faced higher costs. Last month the BoE said it had heard some food companies were trying to use cheaper recipes. Overall the BoE forecasts inflation will be slower to rise than most private-sector economists do but that it will stay above target for longer predicting an increase to two per cent by the end of next year and 2.4 per cent in late 2018 and 2019. This is a big jump from inflation of 0.6 per cent now and represents the BoE’s highest ever medium-term inflation forecast A further risk is that the start of formal talks to leave the EU next year will revive public concern about the impact of Brexit said Zoe Mills an analyst at Verdict Retail which advises big stores and suppliers. “Sentiment is likely to dip again negatively impacting retail spending” she said predicting discretionary purchases such as electrical goods and home hardware would be worst hit. Car sales to consumers have already fallen slightly. That said British consumer demand has historically proven a more reliable source of growth than business investment or exports both of which face challenges from uncertain EU ties. Neither the BoE nor private-sector econo\\xadmists are predicting a repeat of 2009 when household spending dropped 3.5 per cent in response to the financial crisis. “It takes something pretty massive to stop the UK consumer from spending” HSBC economist Liz Martins said. “The caveat is that no one really knows how this Brexit thing is going to play out.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The European Union plans to give itself powers to move euro clearing business away from London\\'s financial sector to the EU after Brexit and adopt a model closer to that operated by the United States the bloc\\'s executive said today. The financial industry has warned that forced \"relocation\" would split markets bump up trading costs and diminish the status of the euro – as well as threaten thousands of jobs in the City of London. The draft EU law would as a last resort force euro-denominated clearing business to shift from London if the volume was deemed by Brussels to be systemically important. The bulk of clearing in euro-denominated derivatives is performed in London and involves a third party standing between two sides of a trade to ensure its smooth and safe completion. The bloc\\'s regulators would have a say on the amount and type of collateral the clearing house holds The European Central Bank (ECB) and eurozone policymakers have long wanted control over euro clearing saying it is core to the single currency area\\'s financial stability and would be outside the EU\\'s regulatory sphere once Britain leaves in 2019. Valdis Dombrovskis the European commissioner who proposed the draft law said Brexit meant that \"certain adjustments to our rules\" were needed. Under the draft law if the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) decides that a non-EU clearer is handling \"systemically\" important volumes of euro-denominated business a system of \"enhanced supervision\" would be introduced. This would mimic how US regulators already have direct oversight of London clearing houses that handle dollar-denominated instruments – though there is no provision for forcing through a relocation of a clearing house. Under the EU law the bloc\\'s regulators would have a say on the amount and type of collateral the clearing house holds ensure it meets any additional requirements from the ECB and hold on-site inspections. The first aim of the law is to centralise supervision of EU-based clearing houses with ESMA taking the lead backed by central banks such as the ECB. At present national supervisors oversee 17 clearers. The second aim is to build on the existing system of \"equivalence\" whereby 28 non-EU clearers can at present serve customers in the bloc if it complies with rules similar to the EU\\'s. Two-tier equivalence means the bulk of foreign clearers will continue under the existing system. Others would be deemed \"systemically important\" and require enhanced supervision with only a few likely to labelled as \"substantially systemically important\" and required to rebase to the bloc a process that would be phased in over 18 months. Brussels acknowledged that relocation could cause higher costs for users due to market fragmentation and has introduced \"proportionate risk requirements\" to mitigate this. But some trades could be cleared more cheaply in the EU officials said. \"If enhanced supervision does not work because it is so systemic then there can be a decision to require relocation. That is a last resort\" an EU source said. ESMA would have to make a relocation recommendation with input from the ECB but the European Commission would take the final decision. The European Commission decided not to include quantitative criteria for \"systemic\" clearing houses such as caps on clearing volumes leaving ESMA to make assessments case by case. Simon Gleeson a regulatory partner at international law firm Clifford Chance said there was no question of UK clearing being forced to relocate. \"The issue is whether and to what extent the EU wishes to prevent EU banks from clearing euro trades outside the EU\" Gleeson said. \"I think what is really going on here is the EU trying to create a bargaining chip that it can employ to get a more substantial say in the way that London clearing is regulated post-Brexit.\" The draft law will need approval from EU states and the European Parliament. Most euro-denominated clearing of derivatives is performed by LCH a unit of the London Stock Exchange and the largest clearer of interest rate swaps. A global derivatives industry body warned on Monday that shifting clearing of euro-denominated derivatives from London to the continent would require banks to set aside far more cash to insure trades a cost that would be passed on to companies. Officials from the Bank of England which supervises LCH have warned that euro clearing could shift to New York but any US clearing house that became a \"systemic\" clearer of euro-denominated instruments would also come under the new EU rules. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Companies seeking to “bulk up” to offset the uncertainty caused by Britain’s looming EU exit helped to spur a near doubling of domestic mergers and acquisition activity this year according to Thomson Reuters data. The volume of UK domestic deals surged to £51 billion as the number of deals between British groups jumped from 1480 to 1681 the highest level since 2008 the data show. They included online gambling company GVC’s purchase of bookmaker Ladbrokes Coral for as much as £3.9 billion and Hammerson’s £3.4 billion acquisition of rival shopping centre operator Intu Properties. It comes against a backdrop of often fractious Brexit negotiations between London and Brussels this year talks that are yet to provide businesses with clarity about Britain’s future relationship with Europe. Bosses at British companies have also been eyeing new US President Donald Trump whose decisions have repercussions for businesses around the world. “At the beginning of 2017 there were a lot of questions about what was going to happen to the market given the global uncertainty caused by Brexit and the new US president” said Nick Cline a London-based partner at law firm Latham &\\xa0 Watkins who said the uncertain environment had acted as a driver for some deals rather than stifling activity. “There are a lot of corporates out there in the UK and Europe who are seeing the changing landscape and as a result are even more focused on what they’re going to do to be tomorrow’s leaders.” Overall volumes with any UK involvement dipped 0.7% to $375bn The jump in domestic deal-making contrasted with falls in both inbound and outbound UK volumes the data show with the former slipping 12.9 per cent to $115.1 billion and the latter down 9.4 per cent to $112.5 billion. That meant overall volumes with any UK involvement dipped 0.7 per cent to $375 billon a softer decline than the 1.4 per cent slide in global deal volumes to $3.5 trillion according to the data. Philip Noblet HSBC’s co-head of global banking in the UK said that “a lot of the obvious sector consolidation deals that people expected to happen” were struck this year and were “driven by the Brexit climate which is prompting companies to bulk up”. However a dearth of blockbuster deals meant that overall volumes involving any British companies remained much lower than in 2015 when they totalled $605.5 billion swelled by Anheuser-Busch Inbev’s $110 billion acquisition of FTSE 100 brewer SABMiller and Royal Dutch Shell’s $53 billion tie-up with BG Group. “It’s hard to see how any more of the really big deals are going to happen going forward without there being quite significant competition issues” said Noblet. Kraft Heinz’s $143 billion attempt to buy consumer goods giant Unilever in February which would have been one such megadeal failed within days when the US food company walked away after the FTSE 100 business rejected its offer. Potential British government scrutiny of the deal was a concern raised during talks between the two companies a person familiar with the matter told Reuters at the time. Since Theresa May became Prime Minister in July 2016 Britain has taken a more cautious approach towards foreign acquisitions of British assets. In October the government proposed new rules to give it more say over deals in the defence and technology sectors although Cline said the government’s change of tack had not represented “a step-change this year in the way the UK looks at deals”. He said: “Occasionally a transaction comes up where there’s a question about UK government intervention.” Cline forecasts that British activity will remain strong in 2018 while Jan Skarbek managing director of UK banking and broking at Citigroup also thinks there will be an increase. “Organic growth is very difficult in this environment and staying still is not an option for many companies” he said. “So I think there will be more deals next year despite the geopolitical uncertainty.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

More than 20 major international institutions chose to set up all or part of their activities in Luxembourg last year the country’s financial development agency said yesterday linking the decisions to Britain’s move to leave the EU. The tiny EU member state is one of several countries vying for a slice of Britain’s lucrative financial services sector as slow progress in its talks to exit the bloc prompts firms to move ahead with contingency plans to secure EU market access. During 2017 five banks including Citibank JP Morgan and China Everbright; more than a dozen global asset managers including Blackstone and Carlyle; and 10 global insurance companies decided to establish or expand their presence in the duchy Luxembourg For Finance said in a statement. “Following the UK’s decision to leave the EU last year alone over 20 top-ranked international institutions chose Luxembourg to set up all or part of their activities and benefit from the specialisation that exists within the Luxembourg financial ecosystem” it said in a statement. A total of 139 banks from 28 countries are based in Luxembourg it added with a focus on investment management private banking and the\\xa0business\\xa0and trade finance sectors. “Luxembourg is expecting further announcements from\\xa0businesses over the coming months whether in the insurance fund management banking or fintech sectors” it said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Scotch whisky-makers were among the most fervent industry advocates for staying in the European Union but if Britain has to leave they prefer a clean break. The industry already busy preparing for transport and logistical challenges says it would be happy to stay in the EU single market and the customs union after Britain leaves the world’s largest trading bloc if it had a say in regulations and a right to make bilateral trade deals. If that’s not possible then it would be better to have no deal and default to World Trade Organisation rules which mandate a zero per cent tariff on Scotch imports into the EU said Karen Betts chief executive officer of the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA). “When we think it through there are real risks if you stay in the single market of continuing to be bound by the EU’s rules but not being able to influence them” she said. The industry would keep an open mind as long as negotiations with Brussels are going on however she said. The industry position matters: Scotch exports were worth £4.36 billion in 2017 more than one fifth of all of Britain’s food and drink exports and 40000 jobs. To some extent its position is unique. For one thing there’s the advantageous tariffs under the WTO which apply to almost all spirits. For another while its supply chain is almost all UK-based exports account for 90 per cent of output meaning it has seen big benefits from the post-Brexit weakness in the pound. Protected by a UK law which means it can only be made in Scotland Scotch is dominated by multinationals like Diageo and Pernod Ricard and has been an export sector for centuries. Distillers are skilled in cross-border trade and able to absorb logistical challenges and extra costs. What the industry wants now is clarity What the industry wants now is clarity about the terms under which Britain will leave the EU and how much time it has to get ready for it. “We play the cards that we are dealt. We kind of just want to know what the cards are” Betts said. A big concern shared by other goods exporters is how transport to the EU will be affected by a change in IT systems for trade with non-EU countries agreed before the Brexit vote. If the agreed transition is not long enough following Brexit Day on March 29 2019 the system may have to be used for all exports including to the EU just months after it has been introduced. The volume of declarations processed annually in that case will rise to 255 million from 55 million now the government says so it needs to be running glitch-free by then. Whisky-makers are making contingency plans for alternative routes and storage in case border delays affect sales or costs. France Spain and Poland are among the top 10 global destinations for Scotch together accounting for 19.3 million nine-litre cases in 2016 or 21 per cent of the total according to drink industry researchers IWSR. By far the world leader with 13.6 million cases France is led by Marie Brizard which ships William Peel Scotch from Scotland but also French spirits and cognac into Britain. The company’s Scotch travels to France via Belgium using ships and trains instead of trucks. Chief Executive Jean-Noel Reynaud believes logistical disruptions will be manageable. “We will just have to adapt to the new supply chain rules” he said. “If we have to account for another one or two weeks in the supply we’ll do so. When we export to China it takes much more time than just importing from the UK.” If there are bottlenecks producers can build regional stocks taking advantage of the fact that Scotch is not perishable said Duncan Swift who runs the food advisory group at business consultancy Moore Stephens. Pernod Ricard which has 20 per cent of the French market with its Clan Campbell and Ballantine’s brands already operates via 85 distribution centres around the world and could easily use one in Europe or rent more space chief executive Alexandre Ricard told Reuters this month. The next few months will be key. “What is absolutely critical for our business is to be ready to adapt swiftly” Ricard said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 31st 08:22  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: European Commission  As negotiations on the next EU Budget are entering the final lap Brussels is piling pressure on member states to reach some form of agreement in time for next May’s MEP elections. The Times of Malta was recently invited for a media seminar on the matter.\\xa0 Failure to reach agreement on the EU Budget before the May 2019 European elections would play into the hands of populists and jeopardise the bloc’s unity according to Budget Commissioner Gunther Oettinger. The scenario could be even worse should there be no deal on the UK’s departure from the bloc he believes. \\xa0 “An EU Budget agreement would be a sign that Europe is still standing together. There is much more at stake here than a mathematical exercise as there are European elections ahead” he said. Mr Oettinger sounded this warning last week when addressing a conference in Brussels ahead of the forthcoming European Parliament debate in Strasbourg and more importantly the December summit. Known as the Multiannual Financial Framework the next EU Budget will cover the seven-year period between 2021 and 2027.\\xa0 Last May the European Commission presented its proposals which for some member states including Malta resulted in aggressive cuts of up to 24 per cent where it hurts most – cohesion funds. These comprise the co-financing of capital projects like roads. In Malta’s case the proposed budget will result in €179 million less funds with the total cohesion funds allocation going down to €597 million. The reduction is both the result of a new mechanism to distribute funds and the effect of robust economic growth which means there is less justification to tap funds to bridge the disparity between the quality of life on the island and the EU average.\\xa0 While Maltese diplomats in Brussels were tight-lipped when approached by this newspaper a senior commission official dismissed the idea of Malta becoming a net contributor. This budget could be an anchor of stability for the next 10 years “I do not understand why the Maltese should be worried on the matter as that would mean reaching Sweden in economic terms which is a prosperous country” he remarked. From a wider perspective the overall EU Budget for the 27 excluding Britain will be of €1279.4 billion. The value could differ but no drastic changes are to be expected. One of the major sticking points is a proposal to link funding with the rule of law to the point that this could be suspended. For such thing to happen the commission must first make a proposal which must be adopted by the EU Council.\\xa0 Needless to say countries like Hungary and Poland which have been at loggerheads with Brussels over human rights issues and migration are not very keen on the matter. While acknowledging that the situation on Brexit is very volatile commission officials who spoke to the Times of Malta on condition of anonymity were more upbeat on the progress registered so far when it comes to the budget. One of them even insisted that talks on the next budget were proceeding at “break-neck speed”. In this respect they sounded very optimistic that come next May a framework agreement would be reached by the 27 member states. Though these talks are very complex in nature the biggest stumbling block is to agree on the “ceiling” levels in six major policy areas excluding the administrative expense of EU institutions themselves.\\xa0Once these values are established the commission can start working on the details. While the UK is taking no part in these talks a no deal on Brexit would send economic shockwaves across the EU. Such scenario would on one hand mean the abrupt termination of EU funds to Britain as from March 29 next year but it would also mean a shortfall in the existing EU budget as Britain would no longer honour its financial commitments. Consequently an agreement on Brexit would ensure a smoother transition for both sides. \\xa0\\xa0 For Mr Oettinger “a no deal would cause huge damage not just for the UK but for the entire European project”. For this reason Brussels is piling pressure on member states to reach a framework agreement by next spring or risk facing a backlash which could result in far-right and Eurosceptic parties making further inroads. “This budget could be an anchor of stability for the next 10 years” the commissioner is warning. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The UK referendum result confronts us with a new political and economic reality that we will all have to face whether we like it or not. This is a momentous decision of historical proportions and its short- and long-term impact will be enormous for all concerned. For the UK there will be some tough decisions to be taken the first of which were announced by Prime Minister David Cameron last Friday a few hours after the official result was announced. More difficult choices will have to be made when the details of the uncoupling start to be negotiated with the EU. All of this will be happening at a time when inevitably the future of Scotland and possibly Northern Ireland will dominate the UK political agenda. I have no doubt that Malta will closely follow these developments and that it will do so in a manner that will seek to consolidate – if not strengthen – its political and economic ties with the UK. In my opinion it is strategically crucial for us Maltese that the UK remains a strong economic player even in a post-exit scenario. Our economy our jobs our opportunities in education certain aspects of our health services our tourism and so many other sectors depend on this. It is strategically crucial for us Maltese that the UK remains a strong economic player even in a post-exit scenario. This argument is also valid from an EU perspective. Last Friday’s referendum result risks creating knee-jerk reactions and emotionally charged statements which are very much short-sighted. Of course the EU will make it clear to the UK government that ‘out’ means ‘out’ and that existing privileges enjoyed as of right by citizens of member States will have to cease without reservations. But arguing that the UK must now be treated in a heavy-handed manner because of the disappointing outcome of the referendum would be a disastrous approach that would have long-term negative effects. Brexit will happen within the next two years. But this will not mean that the UK will no longer be a strategically important neighbour of the EU with whom political and economic ties will have to be fashioned in a manner that responds to the new realities. Malta’s forthcoming presidency of the Union in January 2017 will therefore present us with an opportunity to contribute in a constructive manner towards achieving this delicate but crucial balance between the fact that the UK will now have to face the realities of non-membership on the one side and the need to consolidate the political and economic ties with the UK as a crucial strategic partner on the other side. In this context I honestly hope that our Prime Minister will follow up on the Leader of the Opposition’s offer to cooperate at all levels in order to achieve what is in the best interest of our nation and of our citizens. The future of the Union will depend on its ability to reboot its policies to bring them in sync with what our citizens need Detractors of the Nationalist Party cannot deny the fact that our track record in the EU indicates a high level of experience and expertise which unfortunately in most cases remains dormant and unutilised. What a pity! It was this experience and expertise that managed to keep Malta on an even keel during the financial and economic crisis that reached its peak between 2008 and 2011. Notwithstanding all the odds stacked against us Malta’s economy grew our unemployment was contained our financial position remained healthy and our repu\\xadtation remained intact even though we were surrounded by countries that were bleeding to death. The experience and expertise is there – I have no doubt that using it and using it well will benefit our citizens directly. But the tremors caused by Brexit go further than this. There is a fundamental challenge inbuilt into the Brexit outcome and it is a challenge that EU citizens feel in their bones. Brexit is the offspring of a failure by the EU to respond to what our citizens feel to be their major concerns. Need we remind our EU political leaders that they failed to show solidarity with those countries facing mass irregular migration on their own? Need we remind them that there are millions of young people who are seeking jobs but are unable to find them notwithstanding their university degrees? Need we remind them that austerity without a human approach is contrary to the very values on which the EU was built? Need we remind our EU political leaders that they failed to show solidarity with those countries facing mass irregular migration on their own? I do not blame the EU project for this failure. I blame those political leaders who failed to understand what was in the best interest of the common good and instead preferred to adopt populist short-term solutions that created the mess we are in today. This is why I believe that the future of the Union will depend on its ability to reboot its policies to bring them in sync with what our citizens need with their aspirations with their concerns: stability security jobs education health environment migration terrorism. Will Britain’s referendum be replicated in other countries? Readers will already be familiar with calls of this nature by some far-right politicians in France and the Netherlands. There will be others of course. It is ironic however that probably the next phase of this drama will be played on Scottish territory where the issue will not be one of an exit but one of an entry. From where I stand the issue of exit or entry leave or remain centres around the very essence of what gave birth to the European Union in the first place. Perhaps it is necessary to remind ourselves that the EU project stands for respect for the human dignity of every person respect for our human rights our freedom our democracy. It stands for equality and the rule of law. In practice it stands for the protection of the environment clean seas clean air. It stands for workers’ rights health and safety and equal rights for men and women. It stands for free movement access to education soli\\xaddarity among nations cultural diversity. A political project built on these values cannot be allowed to fail. The common good demands that we all contribute to make this project a success that will benefit our present and future generations.

Operation Yellowhammer is the code name for the UK government’s no-deal Brexit contingency planning. The Yellowhammer is a small bird with a distinctive call that is often thought to say “a little bit of bread and no cheese”. Some might think it a sinister reference to the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on British households (the pattern lines on the bird’s eggs were also once thought to carry a concealed message) – although code names for UK operations are supposed to be generated randomly. As for the contingency plans Operation Yellowhammer is being run by Cobra the government’s emergency committee. Given that how Brexit will happen still remains unclear contingency planning continues to be essential. It is understood that the implementation of most measures which was supposed to start on March 25 has been deferred although there are reports that planning is well behind schedule.\\xa0Some 3500 troops have been placed on standby to assist and ferries have been booked to ensure essential medical supplies Not much is known about the details of Operation Yellowhammer. There are more than 300 contingency plans across government departments but the core elements relate to securing critical supplies and keeping traffic moving. Some 3500 troops have been placed on standby to assist and ferries have been booked to ensure essential medical supplies. There are also contingency plans relating to potential problems for UK nationals who could be stranded in other European countries in a worst-case scenario. One of the most pressing worries is the potential for traffic chaos around the UK’s main ports as increased checks may be required. This could lead to huge traffic jams in Kent on the south-east coast with the port of Dover and Eurotunnel the main connections to continental Europe. Nearly 12000 trucks on average pass through them a day with around 15000 on some days. Dover alone handles 6% of UK trade by volume a much higher percentage by value and most of this trade is time sensitive.\\xa0Nearly 12000 trucks on average pass through them a day with around 15000 on some days The UK government has indicated that the bulk of inward trade from the continent would not be subjected to increased checks and that any changed duties from the announced tariff changes could be collected without physical checks at the port. But the traffic chaos in Kent relates normally to outbound trucks and factors beyond the control of the UK government namely bad weather in the English Channel or strike action in France. French customs officials have already demonstrated how well they can paralyse connections to and from the UK by imposing extra checks at passport control. More detailed checks were imposed at ports from March 4 2019 and strike action in the week beginning March 21 2019 caused lengthy delays to Eurostar passengers at Paris Gare du Nord. Only a small additional delay at the ports can soon produce long tailbacks on the motorways. Operation Brock one element of Operation Yellowhammer is due to start on March 25. This will park some of the trucks heading to Dover on one lane of the M20 allowing non-truck traffic to flow on the other lanes and divert others to a lorry park on the disused Manston Airport so they do not completely block the roads. But this will potentially still cause traffic chaos on all surrounding roads. The M20 section can hold an estimated 11000 trucks and Manston can only hold a maximum of 6500 trucks barely enough for a busy day’s traffic of 15000 trucks. Kent County Council issued warnings to schools and care homes about the possibility of shortages of key supplies and the consequences of traffic disruption. Kent Police have also been given £3.5m in extra resources to cover any extra no-deal Brexit costs.\\xa0Queues at St Pancras for Eurostar trains to Paris (where border checks are made by French officials) could be up to a mile long While Kent may be the geographical focus for some of the most obvious problems there were suggestions based on a leaked government report that queues at St Pancras for Eurostar trains to Paris (where border checks are made by French officials) could be up to a mile long involving enough people to fill up to four trains as a result of passport checks holding things up. Services would have to be cancelled to deal with the slow down. This is despite the fact that the European Commission said trains could keep running as normal for three months in the event of no deal. These problems arise from the fact that most effort has been placed on assuming that there will be an orderly exit from the EU. The political declaration that accompanies Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement included a significant “implementation phase” from the date that Britain leaves the EU. This period of around 21 months to the end of 2020 would give space to make the necessary agreement to settle the terms of the future relationship and plan for factors such as cross-border movements with a greater degree of certainty. No-deal planning was slow to start because it was thought to be unlikely and potentially a waste of resources. Now the UK is in a situation where although parliament has rejected a no-deal exit the UK can still get there by default if there is no alternative that can command parliamentary support. Plus even if a no-deal situation is seen to be inevitable planning for it is difficult when the UK cannot control the actions of neighbouring countries. This looks like a classic case of the prisoner’s dilemma in game theory: which almost always ends badly for both sides. That is unless the players collude – and that implies a deal or at least deciphering the markings on the Yellowhammer’s eggs.

Dr Fenech said that member states wanted the UK to remain within the EU as it brought a much needed balance to discussions especially those related to the economy which were usually dominated by three main powers – the UK France and Germany.In a recorded message former Commissioner Tonio Borg said that ideas such as liberalism and a free common market - which were pillars of the EU - would be dealt a \"blow\" if the UK were to leave the union.Meanwhile Parliamentary Secretary Ian Borg expressed concern that negotiations for Brexit would be time-consuming and could divert attention away from more pressing issues such as security and migration. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said this evening that was impressed by the preparations made by the EU’s Brexit negotiations team headed by Michel Barnier whom he met this morning and the detail they had gone into already. “For example Michel (Barnier) told me \\'do you know how many cats and dogs cross from Dover to Calais on the pet passport?\\'. He said 250000 and we need to find a solution to this as well.\" The Brexit negotiations would be tough Dr Muscat said but there was a willingness to arrive to a fair solution to everyone not just one side. The comment was made as Dr Muscat joined EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in a public dialogue on the future of Europe.\\xa0 In a sad day for Europe marked by the triggering of the Brexit process Mr Juncker was in good humour joking that he was looking forward to pastizzi and Cisk paid for by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat.\\xa0 Mr Juncker and Dr Muscat replied to a range of questions including Brexit democracy and terrorism but the humour came out when the president of the Malta Grandparents Association asked Mr Juncker whether he would consider having the EU declare a Day of Grandparents in recognition for their service in forming tomorrow\\'s generation. \\'I am dealing with Brexit\\' an incredulous Mr Juncker replied.

The British government is in favour of having an even closer relationship with Malta after\\xa0Brexit Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said on Tuesday. Giving the House an overview of the Maltese government’s efforts to prepare for Brexit Dr Muscat said there was a willingness from the United Kingdom to maintain strong ties with Malta. This he added could take a form that was even more wide-ranging than previous bilateral agreements however nothing was cast in stone until Brexit actually went ahead. Read: SMEs to be assisted to cope with Brexit Dr Muscat said the UK’s decision to leave the EU had been on the agenda at last month’s European Council summit in Austria which he had attended. However no agreement was reached.\\xa0 Opposition leader Adrian Delia said he too had hoped for an agreement by now. He made a number of questions on how Brexit\\xa0was expected to impact Malta and what was being done to prepare for it. Would British aircraft be free to land in Malta or Maltese ships enter UK ports? What would happen to Maltese students studying in Britain? And what about business relationships such as UK-Malta car imports? Dr Delia said he had also hoped to hear more about Brexit in Monday’s Budget especially with the uncertainty that this was creating among Maltese businesses and families. Other Opposition MPs asked whether the government was commissioning studies on the impact Brexit could have on the island including on the tourism sector. The government Dr Muscat said had been quick to set up a Brexit task force on which the Opposition also had a seat. This body was coordinating much of Malta’s Brexit efforts including looking into opportunities and assessing threats to the island. Illustrating the complexities of the\\xa0Brexit talks at the summit the prime\\xa0minister said the issue of the nature of the frontier between the UK and Northern Ireland was a major headache. How would road borders be monitored? Would sea travel also require a border control? And could reintroducing such frontiers spark the flame of Irish terrorism that had all but been extinguished in recent years? Dr Muscat said the government did not want to be fatalistic about Brexit but was already preparing for worst case scenarios. “Even in the worst possible case our health agreement with the UK will remain” he said adding that Malta was not only an EU member state but also a member of the Commonwealth. The Customs Department Dr Muscat said was among the most prepared to deal with a Brexit and so he was confident in its ability to manage such a transition. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair outlined his \"mission\" to persuade people to \"rise up\" and change their minds on Brexit arguing that the vote to leave the European Union poses a threat to the future of the country. Current Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to trigger Article 50 and start the process of leaving the EU next month and has outlined her vision of a clean break from the bloc including leaving the single market. She has also warned politicians against disrupting the process. However in his first major political intervention since the vote last June Blair issued a rallying cry to opponents of Brexit saying there was little clarity over what the vote meant when the referendum took place and that the government was set on \"Brexit at any cost\". \"The people voted without knowledge of the true terms of Brexit. As these terms become clear it is their right to change their mind\" he said to pro-European group Open Britain. \"Our mission is to persuade them to do so.\" Blair served as prime minister from 1997 to 2007. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Bank of England Governor Mark Carney told business leaders that the 2016 Brexit vote is costing Britain’s economy around £10 billion a year the Times newspaper said yesterday. Carney was asked by an attendee at a meeting on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos to quantify lost economic growth since the referendum the newspaper said. While Britain’s economy has performed better than the BoE forecast after the June 2016 referendum it grew at the slowest pace of all Group of Seven rich economies over the first three- quarters of 2017. Carney said he thought the loss to economic growth was equivalent to between two-thirds and three-quarters of the weekly £350 million boost to public spending that Brexit supporters said was a key advantage of Brexit the Times reported. Government statisticians have accused Britain’s Foreign Minister Boris Johnson of misusing state data by repeating the £350 million-a-week figure. A spokesman for the BoE declined to comment on the report which was based on comments from people who attended the meeting. Media were not allowed to attend. Carney has been criticised by Brexit supporters for previous public comments he has made on the impact of a vote to leave the bloc on Britain’s economy. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s most prominent campaigner for leaving the European Union Boris Johnson has suggested building a giant bridge across the English Channel to France after Brexit The Daily Telegraph reported. Foreign Secretary Johnson who led the campaign to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum told French President Emmanuel Macron that he felt it was ridiculous that the two countries were linked by just a single railway. The leading Brexiteer then suggested building a second crossing to which Macron said: \"I agree. Let’s do it\" the newspaper reported. \"Our economic success depends on good infrastructure and good connections. Should the Channel Tunnel be just a first step?\" Johnson said on Twitter. Johnson did not mention the idea of a bridge explicitly in public and it was unclear if any detailed discussions had taken place about how such a large project might be built or financed. The Daily Telegraph said that Johnson believes a privately-funded 22-mile Channel Bridge may now be an option and would provide the capacity for increased tourism and trade after Brexit. \"Technology is moving on all the time and there are much longer bridges elsewhere\" Johnson told his aides according to the newspaper. A spokesman for the Foreign Office declined to comment. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The French government has activated its plans for handling the effects of a no-deal Brexit which has become \"less and less unlikely\" Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said Thursday. Speaking after a ministerial meeting called to discuss the British parliament\\'s rejection of the divorce deal negotiated with the EU Philippe said: \"I have taken the decision to activate the plan for a no-deal Brexit.\" The plan provides for €50 million of investment in French ports and airports \"which are obviously the places most affected by the changes needed\" in the event of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal. \"In some ports that will be the construction of car parks in others it will be the establishment of infrastructure for carrying out checks\" Philippe said. France had already planned on recruiting extra customs staff and veterinary inspectors. The French parliament is on Thursday expected to complete the adoption of a bill allowing the government to take decisions by decree if necessary following a no-deal Brexit which could create potentially chaotic scenes on both sides of the Channel. \"We want to be ready to protect the interests of our citizens\" Philippe said. \"Our objective is at the same time to respect our obligations to make sure that the lives of our citizens and in a way British citizens living in France are impacted as little as possible\" he added. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Demonstrators wearing EU flags as capes and with homemade banners saying \"Bremain\" and \"We Love EU\" gathered on the streets around Park Lane for the March for Europe rally. Protesters taking part in the event which was organised on social media were due to march through London to Parliament Square. The protest comes after a poll found\\xa0that five per cent of Leave voters would now change their vote compared with two per cent of Remain voters and with nearly half the public 48 per cent demanding a general election before Brexit negotiations begin.  Comedian and satirist Mark Thomas organised the march to address his \"anger frustration and need to do something\". He estimated between 20000 and 40000 people would be at the event. He said: \"We would accept the result of the referendum if it was fought on a level playing field. But it was full of misinformation and people need to do something with their frustration.\" A cheer went up from the crowd at 11.30am as the marchers set off. Father and daughter Bill Baker 59 and Jess Baker 22 from Islington north London had made a banner for the march which read: \"I will always love EU.\" Ms Baker said: \"We didn\\'t want to leave but if you respect the decision of the referendum which we should we still want Britain to be EU orientated outward looking and inclusive.\" I\\'m absolutely outraged at the way people voted the lies the referendum was based on and the divide in the country because of it Philippa Griffin 40 from Hertfordshire brought a French stick to celebrate Europe as her alternative to a protest banner. She said: \"I\\'m absolutely outraged at the way people voted the lies the referendum was based on and the divide in the country because of it. My ideal outcome from this march is that MPs realise that leaving the EU is not what people truly want. It feels like our country has already changed.\" Marie Sansford 66 from Brighton said she was against joining the European Union in the 1970s. She said: \"I feared that joining the EU would allow global companies to take over which has happened to an extent. But being in the EU we can group together with other countries be friends with our neighbours. I don\\'t want to see the whole of Europe fall apart. I\\'m just very worried for future generations.\" The March for Europe supporters launched into an impromptu rendition of John Lennon\\'s Imagine led by a man in the centre of the crowd with an EU flag painted on his forehead armed with a megaphone and bouncing on a friend\\'s shoulders. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Sterling stayed under siege toay holding above a 31-year low against the dollar with sentiment distinctly sour after Britain opted to exit the European Union triggering shockwaves across global markets. The euro was also under pressure pulled down by sterling as Brexit clouded the future of the European Union. Safe-haven currencies like the yen and the Swiss franc extended gains much to the discomfiture of the Japanese and Swiss central banks. Sterling was down 1.8 percent at $1.3460 having hit a trough of $1.3228 on Friday its lowest since 1985. It recovered from a low of $1.3356 struck in Asia on Monday after British Chancellor George Osborne sought to assure markets that he was staying on and that the economy was in good shape. The pound dropped as much as 11 percent on Friday its worst day in modern history as investors betting on Britain remaining in the EU were reversed en masse. And while the shock and panic appeared to have subsided for now price swings are likely to be extreme given the lack of clarity on who runs the British government a likely fresh move for Scottish secession the response of the EU and its ability to contain calls by anti-EU parties across the continent. Given all the uncertainty investors were pricing in a chance of a rate cut with some analysts expecting the Bank of England to consider quantitative easing to cushion the economy. \"The overnight indexed swap market is currently pricing 38 basis points of cuts from the BoE over one-year time horizon\" said Petr Krpata currency strategist at ING adding investors were also concerned about Britain\\'s large current account deficit pegged at 7 percent of GDP. \"While we deem sterling as undervalued at these levels the mixture of political uncertainty flagging growth and concerns about the current account deficit should keep a lid on sterling during the weeks and months ahead and prevent any meaningful or long lasting recovery.\" Many economists have cut growth forecast for the UK. Goldman saw Britain entering a mild recession within a year due to a deterioration in its terms of trade scaled-back investment and tighter financial conditions because of exchange rate fluctuations and weakness in risk assets. SAFETY IN YEN The safe-haven yen and the Swiss franc rose broadly. The Swiss National Bank had intervened on Friday while investors are likely to test the Bank of Japan\\'s resolve in coming weeks. The greenback was weaker at 102.15 yen after shedding 1.8 percent last week. The dollar hit 99 yen on Friday its lowest since November 2013. \"If the yen was to strengthen further it likely won\\'t be due to speculative forces alone. The so-called \\'real money\\' Japanese investors could repatriate funds and add to yen strength\" said Koji Fukaya president of FPG Securities in Tokyo. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday he has instructed Finance Minister Taro Aso to watch currency markets \"ever more closely\" and take steps if necessary four days after Britain\\'s historic vote. The euro was down 0.5 percent at $1.1055 having hit a three-month low of $1.0912. It was 0.7 percent lower against the yen. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain’s shock vote to leave the European Union roiled global markets for a second day yesterday hammering US and European banks lifting bond and gold prices and dragging the British pound to a 31-year low. US stocks opened sharply lower following European markets pulled down by financial stocks amid uncertainty over London’s future as the region’s financial capital. The S&P financial index fell 2.5 per cent. JPMorgan was down 3.3 per cent while Bank of America was down 5.3 per cent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 295.06 points or 1.7 per cent to 17105.69 the S&P 500 lost 39.83 points or 1.95 per cent to 1997.58 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 110.39 points or 2.34 per cent to 4597.59. An index of European bank shares fell 8.89 per cent. Royal Bank of Scotland fell 16 per cent while Barclays shed 18 per cent. Italian banks also suffered. UniCredit fell more than nine per cent. The government was looking at options to help its banks and prevent further share price falls. European stocks took a beating for a second day down 3.7 per cent. Banks at a seven-year low helped push London’s top share index down by 2.5 per cent. British finance minister George Osborne sought to reassure markets saying the world’s fifth-largest economy was strong enough to cope with the Brexit-inspired volatility but the positive impact on sterling was only fleeting. MSCI’s all-country world stock index fell two per cent. Yields on core government debt fell again. German 10-year bond yields the benchmark for eurozone borrowing costs fell as low as minus 0.11 per cent but held above Friday’s record low of almost minus 0.17 per cent. In the scramble for safe-haven assets benchmark US Treasury yields hovered near four-year lows. The 10-year note fell nearly 11 basis points to 1.47 per cent. “The US remains a very powerful place where people can find a safe haven. Foreigners are also getting a kick with the rise in the dollar” said Guy LeBas chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Sterling fell more than 3.65 per cent to $1.310 surpassing its Friday low as yields on 10-year British government debt fell below one per cent for the first time. The euro also seen vulnerable to the exit from the EU of its second-largest economy fell 1.2 per cent to as low as $1.098. The yen firmed as high as 101.52 per dollar. The dollar index which tracks the greenback’s value against six currencies was up one per cent. The rallying dollar helped drag oil prices down. Brent crude dropped more than two per cent to $47.35 before 12 noon EDT (16:00 GMT) while US crude slipped $1.12 to $46.52. Brent and US crude futures have lost about seven per cent since Thursday’s settlement in the rush away from global risk assets. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Germany\\'s European Affairs Minister has held out the possibility of Britain achieving \"special status\" in its relationship with the European Union but pressed London to get on with starting talks on leaving the bloc early next year. British media reported at the weekend that London could delay triggering the procedure for exiting the EU until later next year. Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s spokesman said on Monday she would not begin the proceedings before the end of the year. Michael Roth Germany\\'s European Affairs minister said Britain should be ready to negotiate at the start of 2017. \"Until the end of the year should really be sufficient time to get organised and adjust to the new situation\" he told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. \"We should not let too much time go by.\" European leaders do not want Britain to hold the bloc hostage by horse trading on the terms of an EU exit before it commits to leave. Roth a member of the Social Democrats junior partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel\\'s coalition said only when Britain triggers \"Article 50\" which sets the clock ticking on a two-year deadline to leave the EU could serious discussions begin. It should be possible to complete the negotiations within two years in time for the next elections for the European Parliament in 2019 he said. \"We can\\'t quibble about it. Even if we didn\\'t want or hope for it Brexit won and as it won there can\\'t be any British members in the next European Parliament\" Roth said. Asked whether Britain could adopt a model similar to that of Switzerland or Norway which are not members of the EU but have close ties to it Roth said the deal agreed with London would probably be unlike those struck with other countries. \"Given Britain\\'s size significance and its long membership of the European Union there will probably be a special status which only bears limited comparison to that of countries that have never belonged to the European Union\" he said. \"I want relations between the European Union and Britain to be as close as possible\" he said but added: \"There cannot be any cherry picking.\" Much of the negotiating on Britain\\'s EU exit is likely to focus on a trade-off between access to the bloc\\'s internal market and the free movement of people. Roth showed little sign of a readiness to compromise here. Asked if Britain could retain the market access while putting limits on the free movement of people he replied: \"I can\\'t imagine that.\" \"The free movement of workers is a highly prized right in the European Union and we don\\'t want to wobble on that.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 14th 09:05  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Stocks edged up on Wall Street yesterday not enough to lift a global equities index while crude futures hit a week high after a smaller-than-expected build in US inventories. The euro slipped after Reuters reported European Central Bank policymakers are wary of making any new change to their policy message in April. Weighing on the euro and pound Prime Minister Theresa May formally began Britain’s divorce from the European Union a decision pitching her country into the unknown. On Tuesday the Scottish Parliament backed a bid to hold an independence referendum that could break up the UK adding another layer of uncertainty for investors. Gains in the energy sector up more than one per cent kept the S&P 500 afloat while none of the other 10 sectors moved more than a half a per cent up or down. Wall Street rose on Tuesday with the Dow snapping an eight-day losing streak after a jump in consumer data boosted hopes in a stronger US economy. Yesterday contracts to buy previously owned US homes jumped to a 10-month high in February. “The big talk of the day is Britain’s official request to leave the EU which we think is likely to be a counter balance for the markets for many days to come” wrote in a note Peter Cardillo chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. “We see US oil prices moving towards the $50 range as being the markets driving force of the day.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 67.89 points or 0.33 per cent to 20633.61 the S&P 500 lost 1.65 points or 0.07 per cent to 2356.92 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.01 points or 0.09 per cent to 5880.15. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.35 per cent while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe fell 0.19 per cent. Emerging market stocks rose 0.09 per cent. Overnight MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.42 per cent while Japan’s Nikkei closed up less than 0.1 per cent. The dollar index gained 0.37 per cent with the euro down 0.55 per cent to $1.0752. Sterling hit a one-week low of 1.2378 earlier and was last trading at $1.2407 down 0.33 per cent. “Sterling will be incredibly sensitive to Brexit negotiations and will offer a clear gauge of how things are panning out. We could see it move lower still if negotiations take a sour turn - $1.10 is feasible” said Neil Wilson senior markets analyst at ETX Capital. Oil prices rose after US gasoline stockpiles dropped sharply last week while crude inventories grew less than anticipated. US crude last rose 1.9 per cent to $49.28 a barrel and Brent traded at $52.23 up 1.8 per cent on the day. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 14th 09:05  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The Commission has previously mentioned a ballpark figure of €60 billion that London would have to pay because of various commitments it made as an EU member. But estimates vary depending on what would be included - the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel set a range of a net payment to the EU of between €25 billion and €65 billion. Speaking at a news conference Barnier declined to give an estimate. \"There was never any question about asking the UK to give us a blank cheque; that would not be serious\" he said. \"All we are asking for is for the accounts to be cleared for the honouring of commitments into which the UK has entered ... But you cannot count on me to give you any figures because they are still evolving.\" An agreement on this formula is one of the key conditions the EU has set for the start of discussions on a future trade relationship with London Barnier said. Britain is keen to begin discussing a trade deal as soon as possible because such negotiations can take years. Another initial milestone that would have to be reached is agreement on the date by which EU citizens arriving in Britain would still enjoy all the rights now guaranteed under EU laws. The EU wants this \"cut-off date\" to be the day of Britain\\'s exit March 29 2019 while some in London would rather bring it forward. The EU wants its citizens to have all the rights they enjoy now including the right to permanent residency after five years even if they arrive in Britain on the last day of its EU membership. Britain\\'s Brexit minister David Davis indicated on Wednesday his views were aligned with those of the EU on this issue. \"It is the intention that they will have a generous settlement pretty much exactly what they enjoy now and our British citizens abroad will do the same\" Davis said in a BBC radio interview. Barnier noted the sooner the initial budget and citizens\\' rights issues were settled the sooner the EU could start discussing trade issues which are crucial for Britain because nearly half of its exports go to the EU. Officially it is for Barnier to recommend when trade discussions can begin. \"I hope it will be in the autumn October or November I don’t know. I hope I will be able to say clearly and objectively that there is sufficient progress\" he said. He called for a quick start to the negotiations saying time is \"very short\". The talks are on hold for now because of elections in Britain set for June 8. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  As a diplomat my professional obsession is with the relationships between countries whether between Malta and the UK or the UK and the EU or the US and so on. I have done this from London and from several countries around the world but I have always understood that relationships between countries are not just part of an elaborate board game. They are about people. They are about how people work and live about how they relate to each other and about their many rights which we all hold very dear. We must not forget this when we look at the Brexit debate. The manner of the UK’s departure from the EU will determine the future of our trade and security relationship and will affect many people not least the thousands of British nationals who live here in Malta. The deal concluded in Brussels on November 25 will protect and safeguard the rights of UK and EU citizens living in each other’s countries. From the very start of the negotiations (and indeed long before they began) it was always our intention to protect the rights of British citizens living in EU countries and those of EU citizens living in the United Kingdom. The withdrawal agreement achieves just that. It is an extraordinary achievement of which the UK and the EU can be proud. Here’s what it does for UK nationals living in Malta. They can continue to live their lives after the UK has left the EU in broadly the same way as they do now provided they are legally resident in Malta before the end of 2020. It also means they can continue to: reside in Malta permanently access healthcare receive their UK state pension work freely and without discrimination and have their professional qualifications recognised. It is after all the people-to-people links which give us our strongest bond The agreement also ensures that close family members are protected. So those people living working studying or retired in Malta will be able to keep on doing those things. And the same will apply to Maltese citizens living in the UK. This is not to say that there won’t be some administrative changes such as how citizens will register with the Maltese authorities. In the coming months my team and I at the High Commission will continue to work with the Maltese government on what people will need to do to prepare including if any bureaucratic changes that may be required. Our shared objective is to make this as simple as possible. We will also continue talking to British citizens in Malta at public meetings and on social media to make sure everyone understands the nature of the deal that has been agreed. Of course it is obvious from the extensive coverage in the United Kingdom and Maltese media that the withdrawal agreement still needs to go through the UK Parliament and to be ratified across member states starting with the meaningful vote in the House of Commons later this month. While neither the UK government nor the EU expects or wants a ‘no deal’ scenario the UK continues to draw up necessary contingency plans as is the Maltese government. Both Prime Minister Theresa May and Prime Minister Joseph Muscat have made clear that UK nationals in Malta and Maltese nationals in the UK will continue to be welcome in our respective countries. It is after all the people-to-people links which give us our strongest bond. Stuart Gill is the British High Commissioner for Malta.

The pound recovered ground yesterday after British Prime Minister Theresa May said she plans to return to Brussels to discuss changes to the Brexit deal she agreed with EU leaders last month despite an overwhelming rejection of the draft text by MPs last week. The London stock market ended the day with the thinnest of gains but still outperformed its European peers which all closed lower. Earlier Asian indices closed higher. US markets were closed for a bank holiday making for more modest trading volumes than usual in the rest of the world. There was mixed news out of China with official data showing the country’s economic growth at its slowest pace in 28 years offsetting a report that the country has offered to eliminate its massive trade surplus with the United States – easing trade war tensions between the world’s two biggest economies. Britain meanwhile is on course to crash out of the European Union on March 29 without a deal unless UK MPs can force a delay or come up with an alternative plan that Brussels is also happy with. “Unless the British PM intends to commit political suicide an extension request is the most likely scenario and the EU will most probably agree which should be a positive development that will take the pound towards $1.30 again” predicted Konstantinos Anthis Head of Research at ADSS. At the end of the European business day the pound was trading at just above $1.29. “Of course in the off chance that she doesn’t request an extension or the EU rejects such a request the pound will crash to $1.25” he said. In the event Ms May told parliament yesterday she believed “we can make progress” on the so-called Irish backstop and that she would be consulting MPs about possible changes and “then take the conclusions of those discussions back to the EU”. Beyond updates from Ms May “markets are somewhat devoid of market moving events with the Chinese data released overnight providing the basis for market sentiment outside of the UK today” said Joshua Mahony senior market analyst at IG trading group. Global stock markets had rallied on Friday buoyed by hopes of a breakthrough in efforts to defuse a US-China trade war. China’s top economics negotiator is due to visit Washington this month for more talks as the end of a 90-day truce agreed between US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping draws closer. “For now markets are going ahead with the growing perception that there is a lot of willingness by both parties to make a deal” said National Australia Bank senior strategist Rodrigo Catril.\\xa0 “But the market is also likely to demand more concrete evidence that a deal looks more likely than not.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Talks between British and EU officials to break the Brexit deadlock will \"almost certainly\" last into the weekend Britain\\'s attorney general said on Thursday ahead of a crucial parliamentary vote in London next week. With just three weeks to go until the scheduled departure date of March 29 concern is growing about the possibility of Britain crashing out of the bloc after 46 years of membership with no deal in place. Ahead of Tuesday\\'s vote the British government of Prime Minister Theresa is seeking legally-binding changes to the agreement it struck with the EU in November but which was resoundingly rejected by parliament in January. \"These discussions are running they\\'re going to be resuming very shortly they\\'re going to be continuing almost certainly throughout the weekend\" Geoffrey Cox who is leading the talks told British MPs. Talks have focused on the current deal\\'s so-called \"backstop\" solution designed to keep the Irish border open but which critics say could lock Britain into a customs union with the EU indefinitely. - \\'Still waiting for proposal\\' - On a visit to Britain France\\'s Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau urged British politicians to \"live up to the moment\" as they prepared for the vote. \"So far we are still waiting for a proposal from London it\\'s really a British initiative which has to come\" she said. But she later insisted on BBC radio the EU\\xa0\"cannot reopen\" the withdrawal agreement \"because it is balanced.\" \"The solution is on the table. The withdrawal agreement is the best possible solution.\" Cox rejected criticism that Britain had not presented viable plans to the EU telling MPs the proposals were \"detailed coherent careful\" and \"as clear as day\". - No-deal risks \\'bitterness\\' -European Commission secretary general Martin Selmayr said progress was still possible despite the failure of talks in Brussels so far. \"These things often happen at the very last minute\" he told a Brookings Institution event in Washington. \"We have to wait for the next couple of days and weeks. We have to be very patient.\" Loiseau said the EU did not want to activate the backstop either but rejected Britain\\'s calls for an escape mechanism to be built into it saying \"what is not possible is that one of the parties decide unilaterally to leave\". If May loses Tuesday\\'s vote MPs will then vote on Wednesday on whether to proceed without a deal. If MPs reject that outcome they would then vote on Thursday on whether to ask the EU for a delay. The request for a delay would have to be accepted unanimously by all member states and Britain would have to leave the EU on March 29 if it is rejected. Loiseau said France had been \"preparing for all scenarios\" and that no deal \"will not be a disaster for France or the European Union\" although was concerned it could trigger cross-Channel animosity. \"I\\'m worried that... there would be bitterness between nations and there would be British-bashing in France and French-bashing or European-bashing in London\" she told the Guardian newspaper. \"Why would be there be an extension without a reason?\" Loiseau said. \"We have been in discussions for quite a long time now. There needs to be something specific to justify an extension\" she added pointing out that was the position of French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 14th 09:05  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Talks over Britain\\'s departure from the EU should be as short as possible to avoid prolonged uncertainty prime ministerial candidate Andrea Leadsom said on Monday as she launched her leadership bid. Setting out her stall as the \"Leave\" alternative to frontrunner Theresa May Leadsom said it was in the interests of EU countries to do a tariff-free trade deal with Britain without the UK having to allow continued free movement of people. \"Democratically elected European parliaments will take pragmatic decisions about what\\'s in their interest and they will choose to give tariff-free access to the UK\" she added. \"That will not be I don\\'t think a bargaining chip around free movement.\" Leadsom 53 second-favourite in the race to succeed David Cameron was a leading figure in the campaign to leave the EU. Her position differs from May who backed the \"Remain\" campaign and believes Article 50 which starts the formal process of EU withdrawal might not be invoked until next year. Leadsom has said she will trigger Article 50 as quickly as possible if she wins. \"I intend to keep the negotiations as short as possible\" she told reporters on Monday. \"Neither we nor our European friends need prolonged uncertainty and not everything needs to be negotiated before Article 50 is triggered and the exit process is concluded.\" She said she would guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in Britain something that May has not done. Leadsom a former energy minister and Economic Secretary to the Treasury joined other candidates in ruling out a new general election following the leadership contest. She also said she would keep the United Kingdom together despite calls in pro-EU Scotland for a second independence referendum after last month\\'s EU vote. Conservative lawmakers will gradually whittle down the five contenders to just two starting on Tuesday before grassroots party members vote in early September to decide the winner. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Updated at 7.50pm: adds government statement The European Commission proposed a bigger new multi-year budget on Wednesday that will trigger battles among member states over how to fill the funding gap left by Britain\\'s exit next year. The Dutch led the charge for rich northern states unwilling to step into the Brexit breach: \"A smaller EU ... should have a smaller budget\" Prime Minister Mark Rutte said. Against that France\\'s agriculture minister called it \"simply unthinkable\" to shave 5 percent off Brussels\\' hefty spending on farm subsidies. Poland which the Commission has in its sights with a new mechanism to penalise authoritarian governments that impinge on independent judges warned of \"a long road ahead\" to reach the unanimous compromise required to put the budget into effect. Germany the biggest paymaster was cautious repeating its readiness like France to spend more but only if it was \"fair\". \"With today\\'s proposal we have put forward a pragmatic plan for how to do more with less\" Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told the European Parliament in launching the proposal to spend about 10 per cent more in 2021-27 as a share of output.  Among highlights are sharp increases in spending on border defences against illegal immigration as well as on foreign aid plus more investment in common EU defence schemes research and technology and on helping euro zone governments in difficulty. His plan to spend about 1.11 per cent of the 27 nations\\' combined economic production compare to 1.03 percent of the pre-Brexit 28-country Multiannual Financial Framework now in place. It is worth €1.28 trillion adjusting for future inflation or €1.14 trillion at today\\'s prices - about €160 billion a year compared to €150 billion now. That the Commission argues will be less than a daily cup of coffee for 440 million Europeans and is cheap at the price. National governments typically tax and spend 40 times as much. BATTLES AHEAD The proposal asks member states to let Brussels raise new money directly from new taxes on plastics - designed also to help the environment - and on big global tech firms. But it will also require governments in the wealthier west to chip in more as Britain stops paying its annual €10 billion or so. Some will also see EU rebates phased out over five years. \"A budget for a Europe that protects empowers and defends\" was the Commission\\'s chosen slogan for the day. That language reflects a campaign from Brussels to persuade voters the bloc remains relevant after a decade of crisis that has seen ferocious austerity in countries hit by the eurozone debt crisis and uproar over the arrival of more than a million irregular migrants across the Mediterranean in 2015 alone. \"A Europe that protects\" has also become a familiar demand from French President Emmanuel Macron as he tries to work with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to tighten integration after the ever-sceptical British have left while easing fears among voters that the EU means open borders and jobs exported abroad. Furious battles among member governments however may cast a shadow over the Commission\\'s efforts to patch over rifts as Juncker tries to rally east and west north and south big and small states behind a post-Brexit relaunch next year. EU Budget Commissioner Guenther Oettinger who has called for states to show unprecedented speed and agree the budget within a year or so said it was inevitable that there will be disputes: \"There will be cuts which many countries will complain about\" he told German television. \"And there will be new spending which the others will complain about.\" Malta government statement In a statement on Wednesday evening the government said\\xa0Malta has supported an increase in the budget for education and training as well as higher commitments for migration to ensure that the EU is well equipped to be able to react fast to any crisis. RULE OF LAW AND FUNDING The introduction of a mechanism by which governments would see EU funds withheld if they are deemed not to be respecting the rule of law - in effect targeting ex-communist states where Brussels sees the independence of judges under threat. EU BORDER GUARDS MIGRATION AND ASYLUM Spending to almost triple to €33 billion\\xa0from current €13 billion in order to fund 10000 border guards by 2027. DEFENCE AND SECURITY In its most ambitious defence plan for decades the Commission proposed to spend 22 times more than in the 2014-2020 period - some €13 billion - on a joint weapons fund research shared financing for battlegroups and allowing a coalition of the willing to conduct more missions abroad. Overall the next EU budget sets aside €27.5 billion for security and defence over the seven-year period. That includes €2.5 billion for an internal security fund to fight extremism and cybercrime. EUROZONE STABILITY A reform support programme with a €25 billion\\xa0budget to help EU countries with structural reforms a new convergence facility to aid non-euro EU countries join the common currency a European Investment Stabilisation Function backed by loans guaranteed by the EU budget up to €30 billion which will grant preferential loans to crisis hit EU countries. FOREIGN AID Funding up by 26 per cent to €123 billion to maintain stability and tackle migration. An off-budget €10.5 billion European Peace Facility to fund schemes with non-EU countries. NEW SOURCES OF REVENUES Some €22 billion annually targeted to be raised from new revenue streams accounting for about 12 per cent of the total budget which include EU countries contributing 20 per cent of revenues from emissions trading system auctions a three percent call rate on a new common consolidated corporate tax base and 80 cents per kilogram of non-recycled plastic packaging waste for a total amount of about €7 billion. EUROPEAN GLOBALISATION ADJUSTMENT FUND €1.58 billion in one-off aid to workers laid off due to adverse developments in global trade and economic disruption FARMING SUBSIDIES Direct payments will be reduced by 4 per cent and better targeted compulsory capping of subsidies will be imposed at farm level with funds diverted to smaller farms in the same country. A new crisis reserve would be set up to deal with problems arising from unexpected developments resulting from the actions of non-EU countries. The overall EU agricultural budget will be cut by 5 per cent. DIGITAL NETWORKS AND PROJECTS €12 billion - a ninefold increase RESEARCH AND INNOVATION Funding up by 50 per cent with €100 billion for flagship programmes Horizon Europe and nuclear research programme. REBATES All rebates to be phased out over five years and the rebate EU countries keep for collecting customs revenues to be halved to 10 per cent from 20 per cent. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

It seems like UK democracy is having a self-imposed nervous breakdown. That may be true. But the breakdown is not without cause. And other countries should be wary of seeing this as a peculiarly British problem. It is not. Its roots lie in the tensions created by increasing globalism and unless we’re careful no country is immune from breaking down under the same tensions – even if the breakdown takes a different form. Globalisation with its very many strands has brought economic benefit to billions of people. It has for a period increased collaboration between nation states as economies became increasingly intertwined. People have been exposed to others’ cultures and norms increasing mutual understanding and cultural exchange. But all good things can be taken too far. Globalisation has now reached a stage where the concept of a political economy has been fractured. While political legitimacy that is where people feel connected to their polity has remained largely national or subnational our economies have become transnational or global. This has broken the legitimising link between politics and economics. National governments feel increasingly helpless. Buffeted by global events at the mercy of global bond markets with ever decreasing fiscal revenues due to industrial scale tax arbitrage being increasingly played off one against the other in industrial investment never knowing when the next major multinational corporation will disinvest and move elsewhere leaving them to clear up the resultant social disruption. In such circumstances it is no wonder that citizens are left to wonder whether their democracies have any function left. Does it really make a blind bit of difference who they vote for – or if they vote at all? Harvard’s Dani Rodrik has long argued that there is an inherent tension between legitimate democracy and globalisation. The Brexit chaos can be assessed in this context. It is proving impossible to find a reasonable accommodation between the desire to maintain close economic integration with close trading partners while simultaneously having a self-determining and legitimate national democracy. Looked at in this way it may not be surprising that the UK Europe’s longest established nation and the longest established parliamentary democracy has been the first to open this Pandora’s box only to find that the tensions may well be irresolvable. While the UK may be the first it is unlikely to be the last. In country after country the backlash against globalism is seeing the rise and increasing success of parties and leaders that stand on a nationalist platform. Such parties do not focus much on economics. Their appeal is cultural. They focus on the erosion of national identity in a globalised world; a world where multiculturalism has been imposed on their people without consent where governments are increasingly powerless to protect the people against global economic and social forces. It is easy unjustifiably condescending and intellectually lazy simply to dismiss such forces as ‘populist’. They are a response to real political cultural economic and social changes – many of them a direct result of increasing globalism. All good things can be taken too far Neither is this a new phenomenon. As far back as 1907 Friedrich Meinecke explored the writings of German intellectuals from the Enlightenment until the late 19th century. He showed how the rise of German nationalism was intimately intertwined with a form of cosmopolitanism. But we seemed to have learned nothing from it. We have kept pushing an ethic of globalism to the point where many feel that their national identity is under threat; that they are in effect being deprived of their emotional and cultural home. For those who still believe that the idea of the nation state is obsolete I would ask them to reflect on this question: with the waning of religion ethnicity geography and common cultural norms as uniting forces in society what is there that will hold our societies together? The answer cannot simplistically be individual economic prosperity. An excessive focus on economics at the expense of cultural and social cohesion risks transforming communities and societies into an incoherent gaggle of self-centred individuals only out for themselves. The result will not be the cohesive society with a sense of shared solidarity that is the bedrock of any democracy and welfare state. Rather it will be a Hobbesian world of all against all. Rather we need to revitalise the nation state. Not simply as a set of borders on a map. But as a collection of peoples who have a significant degree of cultural cohesion a shared narrative as to who they are where they came from culturally and why they belong together in mutual solidarity. Only then can democracy and the welfare state survive. We are all now at risk of creating societies made up of two warring tribes – the globalists and the nationalists. These two opposing forms of identity politics will all too easily focus on fighting and demonising each other rather than trying to find ways to meet what are fundamental challenges that threaten the survival of democracy. That is what is happening in full technicolour and in the global public eye in a Brexit UK. But it is happening in very many other places too. To overcome this we need to rediscover the concept of internationalism (or internationalism) – the nurturing of willingly given cooperation between culturally and socially cohesive nation states – rather than the more recent concept of a globalism shorn of any shared values and against which we see a widespread backlash. These principles apply to Europe as much as anywhere else. It is debatable whether the European Union can survive if ‘ever closer union’ can only be achieved at the expense of the cohesion and sense of identity provided by nation states. Germany is right to resists Macron’s man-in-a-hurry attempts at further integration – at least for now. Moving too fast in that direction will emasculate the cultural and social cohesion provided by nation states well before European culture and solidarity are strong enough to have any hope of filling that void. The result is likely to be further social breakdown and further strengthening of nationalist political forces. Moving forward in these integrationist directions should be evaluated in generational time frames not electoral cycle ones.

Photo: Neil Hall/Reuters  Britain has announced plans to cut corporation tax to less than 15 per cent in an attempt to cushion the shock of the country’s decision to leave the European Union raising the prospect of competitive tax cuts across the bloc. Finance minister George Osborne told the Financial Times he wanted to build a “super competitive economy” with low business taxes and a global focus. The new rate which was announced without a target date compares with Osborne’s previous target to cut corporation tax to 17 per cent by 2020 from 20 per cent now. It compares with an average of 25 per cent among most developed economies. Ireland where a 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate has been a cornerstone of economic policy for 20 years drawing investors such as Pfizer and Apple said Osborne’s announcement showed how quickly the EU’s dynamics were changing after the Brexit vote. “This is a very stark reminder of how the world is changing as a result of the referendum result in the United Kingdom” Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe told RTE radio. “The tectonic plates are shifting and this is a very early sign of it. It’s a sharp reminder here to us that your tax system and how it’s structured is an essential part of our national competitiveness” Donohoe said. Ireland’s transport minister said Osborne’s move was an “obvious attempt” to lure investors away from Ireland. “If the headline figure was to come down to 12.5 per cent in the UK it would be threatening to us and we would have to adjust accordingly and make ourselves more attractive again” Shane Ross an independent minister said. The Netherlands said it would review its tax rates to ensure it remained attractive. “It is something we are thinking about with an eye to the future” finance ministry spokesman Paul van der Zanden said. “On the one side we want to fight tax avoidance and on the other we need to look at our investment climate.” Your tax system and how it’s structured is an essential part of our national competitiveness A spokesman for Germany’s finance ministry said plans to cut corporation tax should be fair. “It is clear that it is the [German] government’s aim that the issue of taxes is dealt with in a fair way in the single market” Martin Jaeger said. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in a June 24 internal e-mail seen by Reuters said a further cut in British corporation tax was unlikely but if it happened it would “really turn the UK into a tax haven type of economy”. Some took the announcement by Osborne as the opening salvo in future negotiations with the rest of the EU about Britain’s relationship with its former partners. Pascal Lamy a former World Trade Organisation head said Osborne was moving fast to activate one of Britain’s weapons in the talks as well as trying to reassure foreign investors who are worried about Britain’s access to the EU’s single market. “I can understand that from his side but he has to think about the impact of this on the continent” Lamy told BBC radio. “I am quite convinced that at the end of the day if you want a proper balanced win-win relationship in the future starting with tax competition is not the right way psychologically to prepare this negotiation.” Other elements of Osborne’s plan to steer the economy through the upheaval caused by the Brexit vote included support for bank lending to ensure credit does not seize up more efforts to direct investment to northern England and maintaining Britain’s fiscal credibility the FT quoted him as saying. Last week Osborne said he would no longer target a budget surplus in 2020 because of the expected hit to the economy from the referendum result. Corporation tax accounts for about seven per cent of British tax revenues. The signs from Osborne of a softer approach to fixing the public finances chimed with comments by interior minister Theresa May the leading contender to replace David Cameron as prime minister. Britain’s ruling Conservative party is due to choose a successor to Cameron in September after he offered his resignation following Britain’s June 23 vote to leave the EU. Moreover Bank of England governor Mark Carney said last week that he believed the economy would need more stimulus soon. The BoE may move as soon as today to ease some of the capital requirements on banks and it will decide its position on interest rates next week. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Update 1.26pm - Labour MPs table no confidence motion in their leader Jeremy Corbyn UK Prime Minister David Cameron has said he will step down following the country\\'s referendum decision to quit the European Union.\\xa0 Mr Cameron said that it was time for \"fresh leadership\" and that he expected a new leader to be in place within three months\\' time by the time the Conservative Party held its annual general conference.\\xa0 \"This is not a decision I\\'ve taken lightly but I do believe it is in the national interest to have a period of stability and then the new leadership required\" he said. \"I think it\\'s right that this new Prime Minister takes the decision about when to trigger article 50 and start the process of leaving the EU.\" Making the statement alongside his wife Samantha Cameron choked back tears. He said he had already advised Queen Elizabeth of his decision to stand down. Mr Cameron said he had campaigned \"head heart and soul\" for the UK to remain and that it would now not be right for him to steer the country as it exited the EU. \\xa0 He reassured British expats that there would be \"no immediate change\" in the way people or goods moved across the EU.\\xa0 As he spoke under the gaze of cameras crammed into the narrow London street celebratory horns sounded from cars passing nearby and \"Leave\" supporters marked their victory by waving Union Jack flags. Cameron took office in 2010 as leader of a coalition government and in May last year won a second term with a surprise outright majority at a national election. He had been due to serve as prime minister until 2020. He said he believed he had made \"great steps\" during his time in office citing among other things his landmark move to legalise gay marriage in Britain. \"I love this country - and I feel honoured to have served it ... I will do everything I can in future to help this great country succeed\" he said before taking his wife\\'s hand turning away and walking back into Number 10 Downing Street. Donald Tusk Boris Johnson insulted as he leaves home\\xa0 Insults rained down on former London mayor and leading Leave campaigner Boris Johnson as he left his Islington home this morning with boos and cries of \"scum\" and \"traitor\" clearly audible.\\xa0 Mr Johnson subsequently told reporters that little would change in the short term. \\xa0 \"In voting to leave the EU it is vital to stress that there is now no need for haste and indeed as the Prime Minister has just said nothing will change over the short term\" he told reporters this morning.

The BBC reported that two Labour MPs Margaret Hodge and Ann Coffey had this morning submitted a no confidence motion in their leader over his handling of the EU referendum campaign. \"In a leader you need somebody who can communicate a message and inspire confidence in that message and I think he failed on both counts during the referendum campaign\" Coffey said. \\'No time for hysteria\\' - Donald Tusk In comments earlier this morning European Council president Donald Tusk insisted there would be no legal vacuum at EU level following the UK\\'s decision. He said EU laws would continue to apply until the UK formally left the bloc. \"I have offered an informal meeting of 27 leaders on the sidelines of the upcoming EU summit\" Mr Tusk said. \"I want to reassure everyone that we are prepared also for this negative scenario. As you know the EU is not only a fair-weather project. \"I am fully aware of how serious this moment is. But this is not a moment for hysterical reactions.\" He ended his statement with a defiant statement: \"what doesn\\'t kill you makes you stronger.\" European Parliament president Martin Schultz said the UK referendum result had finally clarified a relationship that had been \"ambiguous\" for decades. \"Now it\\'s clear\" Mr Schultz\\'s social media team tweeted. \"Now we need a speedy and clear exit negotiation.\"\\xa0 For 40 yrs #UK relation with #EU was ambiguous.

Now it\\'s clear. Will of voters must be respected. Now need speedy & clear exit negotiation In a statement to the press Mr Schultz said the European Parliament could play an \"active role\" in Brexit negotiations. The first step he said will be an EP meeting on Tuesday morning to assess the outcome and map out the way forward.\\xa0 “We are very sad about the decision. But it is a sovereign expression of the will of British voters” he said calling it a \"difficult moment “for both sides”. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Labour must \"abide by\" the decision of voters who opted to leave the European Union in the recent referendum Jeremy Corbyn has said. In one of the clearest indications yet that he will not seek to overturn the result of the June 23 poll the Labour leader told Huffington Post that voters had \"clearly said no\" and that Leave supporters would have to \"work our way round that\". His comment comes days after he was repeatedly challenged by leadership rival Owen Smith to join him in demanding a second referendum on whatever deal emerges from Brexit negotiations. In a head-to-head debate in Cardiff on Thursday the Labour leader would say only that the issue of Brexit was likely to feature in the next general election. Mr Corbyn backed Remain in the referendum campaign but has been accused by some critics of mounting only a half-hearted defence of Britain\\'s EU membership. Corbyn backed Remain in the referendum campaign but has been accused by some critics of mounting only a half-hearted defence of Britain\\'s EU membership Asked whether he thought that it would be undemocratic to seek to overturn the result either through a second referendum or an election Mr Corbyn told the Huffington Post: \"I think we\\'ve had a referendum a decision has been made you have to respect the decision people made. We were given the choice we after all supported holding a referendum so we must abide by the decision. \"Does that mean that we don\\'t have a future relationship with the European Union? No it means the opposite. There has to be a very strong relationship so I think there has to be a question of access to the single European market.\" Pressed on whether there was any question of keeping the UK\\'s EU membership the Labour leader said: \"They clearly have said \\'no\\'. Is there a way of having a European Economic Area agreement possibly via Norway and other countries? Yeah there probably is. \"So I\\'m meeting the Norwegian Labour party in September they are bringing a delegation to Britain. The idea being we have a discussion with them about their experience what they do and how they relate to the European Union. It\\'s a serious effort to try to work out how we do things in the future. \"In the meantime there has to be a defence of jobs and there has to be a preparedness by our Government to intervene where necessary such as in the steel industry.\" He added: \"It has happened: the Remain campaign didn\\'t get the majority the Leave campaign did so we\\'ve got to work our way round that. \"And that means crucially speeding up the negotiations for future market access for manufacturing industries particularly in Britain and if we don\\'t speed up that discussion to give some degree of certainty for future market access then I\\'d get very worried about industries in Britain that cannot easily switch to another market. And also what kind of trade structure we are going to have in the future.\" In another interview Mr Corbyn restated his support for an elected Upper House of Parliament denouncing David Cameron\\'s controversial resignation honours list as \"another nail in the coffin\" of the House of Lords. Mr Cameron nominated 13 new life peers including Conservative donors and Downing Street staff while Mr Corbyn also attracted criticism by nominating civil liberties campaigner Shami Chakrabarti shortly after she completed a report on allegations of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. The Labour leader told The Sunday Mirror: \"I want the House of Lords abolished and replaced by an elected upper chamber.\" Describing the 800-member second chamber as \"far too big\" he added: \"Cameron\\'s cronyism has been quite appalling. \"Honours appear to be linked to donations to political parties and personal service to members of his family. I would also say that serving politicians should not be given honours because it\\'s honour enough to be elected to public office.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

High levels of Euroscepticism among British voters may not translate into a vote to leave the EU on June 23 new research has suggested. Fears of the impact of Brexit on the UK economy may explain the reluctance of some voters to convert their dissatisfaction with Europe into a vote to Leave the 2015 British Social Attitudes survey indicated. Some 22% of those questioned said they wanted to leave the EU and 43% said the Union\\'s powers should be reduced - a level of Euroscepticism which has been topped only once since 1992 in the regular survey. But despite this widespread concern about the EU a clear majority of those questioned (60%) said the UK should continue to be a member with just 30% saying it should withdraw. Just 24% of those questioned by pollsters NatCen Social Research felt the British economy would be better off outside the EU compared to 40% who said it would be damaged. NatCen senior research fellow Professor John Curtice said: \"Britain is as sceptical about Europe as it has ever been feelings that seem to be largely driven by concerns about the impact the EU is having on the nation\\'s identity and cultural life not least as a result of high levels of EU immigration. \"However for most people on its own this scepticism is not enough to warrant leaving the EU. The Leave campaign evidently needs to persuade more voters of its economic arguments while Remain has to assure voters that the economic advantages of membership are worth putting up with interference from Brussels.\" Even in Scotland which has traditionally been viewed as more pro-European than the rest of the UK Eurosceptics were in the majority with 17% wanting to quit the EU and 43% wanting its powers reduced - the highest levels since 1999. Across the country there was strong support for a number of changes to reduce the EU\\'s impact on the UK: :: More than two-thirds (68%) favoured reducing EU migrants\\' access to welfare; :: A majority (60%) wanted cuts in EU business regulation; :: More than half (59%) wanted to stop free access to the NHS for nationals of other EU countries; and :: Just over half (51%) wanted to end the free movement of people in the EU. Nearly half of those questioned agreed that membership of the EU was \"undermining Britain\\'s distinctive identity\" against 30% who disagreed. :: NatCen interviewed 1105 people about the EU between July 4 and November 2 2015 as part of the wider British Social Attitudes survey. A ComRes poll for the Daily Mail found the lead for a Remain vote had fallen by six points since last month. The lead now stands at 12 points with 51% saying they would vote to stay in the EU if the referendum was held tomorrow compared with 39% saying they would leave. The poll found Britons were split over the Prime Minister\\'s new deal with Brussels with 45% believing David Cameron had succeeded in his renegotiation and 42% saying he failed. But there were low expectations about whether the deal would have an effect on net migration to the UK with 53% saying they did not think it would change and 21% saying it would increase as a result of the deal while 22% said it would go down. Some 62% of those surveyed said the current level of net migration from the EU was too high. :: ComRes interviewed 1000 British adults by telephone between February 19 and 22. A YouGov poll for the Times suggested the split was significantly closer as 38% backed Brexit and 37% would vote to stay in the union with 25% saying they were undecided or were not planning to vote. It marks a decrease in the nine-point lead for a vote to Leave YouGov found in a poll carried out when the Prime Minister\\'s deal was first published earlier this month. When asked whether they felt leaving or staying in the EU was the safer course of action 43% said Remain and 31% said Leave the latter down 6% on the previous survey. And following his declaration of support for a Leave vote Boris Johnson polled the highest when voters were asked who was most trusted over the referendum reaching 34% ahead of Mr Cameron\\'s 29%. :: YouGov interviewed 3482 people online between February 21 and 23. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 14th 09:05  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Malta’s failure so far to attract large companies which are relocating from Britain is partly a result of poor infrastructure Parliamentary Secretary Silvio Schembri has said. Mr Schembri said that Malta lacked high-quality office space and international schools which puts it at a disadvantage compared to competing jurisdictions such as Dublin Luxembourg and Frankfurt. The parliamentary secretary entrusted with the financial services sector portfolio within the Office of the Prime Minister was not disheartened however by what he described as the “challenges” facing the country. “Cities like Dublin Frankfurt and Luxembourg are already geared to such services but the upside for a country like Malta that is still developing its infrastructure is it can still develop it to be ahead of times and future ready” Mr Schembri said. British financial services firms have been looking at other EU jurisdictions for relocation after Brexit so as not to lose out on the European market. Malta has missed out on some of the big names such as insurers Lloyds of London despite initial interest from these companies. But Mr Schembri is not disheartened noting that some of the biggest firms already operate in the competing jurisdictions and moving there is simply an expansion of existing operations. Malta would struggle as a result of its lifestyle offerings apart from needing domestic talent “There are discussions going on with medium-sized firms which are considering Malta to expand or relocate their business” he added without elaborating. He described Malta’s approach as “proactive yet respectful” in view of its close ties with the UK. “One of our main underlying messages was that firms do not necessarily have to relocate entirely here but can instead choose to set up a part of their operation in Malta and retain passporting rights to the EU” he said. Based on this Mr Schembri added a number of sectors and players have been targeted and the government plans to step up its efforts to attract business. However some within the financial services industry have rued the government’s meek approach to attracting British business Malta’s way. Christopher Orchard CEO of WGP Global a UK-based business advisory firm did not mince words when asked why Malta has been overlooked by large firms. “If Malta did a better job of promoting itself internationally it could attract some of the high-profile exiting businesses… It has to get serious stop talking and start doing” Mr Orchard said. He urged a more aggressive ap-proach to attract a large merchant or development bank to set up in Malta which would encourage businesses to follow. The lack of significant tier 1 banks of international repute apart from HSBC he added was a disadvantage Malta had in its “hardware” because it would not be seen as a serious relocation point. However Mr Orchard also pointed at what he described as the “software factors” dealing mainly with the ‘human’ aspect of business relocation. “Malta would struggle to attract talent to relocate depending on the schools shops theatres and other lifestyle offerings available apart from the need to have domestic talent to fill positions.” Claire Camilleri Gauci director at AID Compliance WGP’s Malta partner believes developing the infrastructure to attract new technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence could provide a cutting edge platform. She said a holistic effort was required to modernise the legal system and encourage more students to pursue maths physics and computer sciences as careers. A strong reform of the regulatory framework was also needed she added. “The creation of a positive economy will attract visionaries entrepreneurs and leaders” Ms Camilleri Gauci said. “Malta could distinguish itself from competitors when trying to attract some of the Brexit business by marketing itself as a digital economy and a place where business is done in English. “However before we start the promotion we really need to make this happen through reforms” she said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 14th 09:05  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A last-minute deal to meet Spanish demands for a say on the future of Gibraltar after Britain leaves the EU salvaged a summit which will go ahead as planned on Sunday to deliver a Brexit accord to British Prime Minister Theresa May. With May due to meet EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker and summit chair Donald Tusk to receive final assurances that all will go smoothly Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez lifted his threat of an effective veto after Britain and EU officials provided written guarantees to Madrid. \"We have received sufficient guarantees to be able to reach a solution to a conflict that has lasted more than 300 years between the United Kingdom and Spain\" Sanchez told reporters in Madrid after talks dragged on through the night in Brussels.We have received sufficient guarantees to be able to reach a solution to a conflict that has lasted more than 300 years between the United Kingdom and Spain The British government wrote to Tusk\\'s European Council to say that it would not interpret its withdrawal treaty due to be endorsed on Sunday as meaning that a future EU-UK trade treaty would automatically apply to Gibraltar -- though London\\'s envoy to the EU said it would seek the best deal for its territory. At the summit on Sunday morning the 27 EU leaders will be asked to approve a declaration specifically excluding Gibraltar from future EU-UK treaties -- while leaving open the possibility that London could negotiate with Madrid on deals for Gibraltar. Saturday\\'s agreements may comfort Spain\\'s hopes that the EU will once Britain is no longer a member swing behind its 300-year-old claim to recover sovereignty over \"The Rock\" home to a historically strategic British naval base and 30000 people. Sanchez\\'s brinkmanship however left some in Brussels uneasy at how he jeopardised a tightly choreographed three hours on Sunday morning for what many saw as domestic political purposes -- he faces a regional election next weekend in Andalusia the province abutting the Gibraltar peninsula. AFTER SUMMIT PARLIAMENTARY BATTLE After a little more than an hour of talks among themselves the 27 EU leaders will meet around 11 a.m. to share with May two key documents -- a treaty setting terms for an orderly British withdrawal on March 29 and an outline of how Britain can keep close to its biggest market by following some EU rules after a status-quo transition period ends in two to four years. She will however face an uphill struggle to have the agreement accepted by her own party and the British parliament. \"We were all looking for a good and fair agreement. Tusk said in a letter on Saturday to the 27 other national leaders confirming that the summit will go ahead. \"And I believe that we have finally found the best possible compromise.\" That is also how May is trying to present her deal. But keeping up pressure within her own Conservative party her Brexit-supporting rival and former foreign minister Boris Johnson called on Saturday for the accord to be renegotiated. The deputy leader of the Northern Irish party which May\\'s minority government relies on for help in parliament as the withdrawal agreement would leave Britain in a \"pitiful and pathetic place ... locked into an EU straitjacket\". The DUP along with many of May\\'s Conservatives and the Labour opposition all threaten to vote down the package. EU officials are unclear what might happen if parliament rejects May\\'s package and like London are making arrangements to manage the disruption of Britain crashing out without a deal. The Gibraltar agreement with Spain provided a reminder of the complexities that Britons have found since voting narrowly in a 2016 referendum to try and unravel 45 years of membership of what is now the world\\'s biggest free trade bloc. As with long months spent trying to square the circle of pulling its troubled province of Northern Ireland out of the EU without creating a disruptive customs border with EU member Ireland the Gibraltar dispute reflected problems with its European neighbours dating back to Britain\\'s imperial past. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit strategy came under attack from all sides on Monday increasing the risk that her plan for leaving the EU will be voted down by parliament and thrust the United Kingdom towards a potentially chaotic \"no-deal\" Brexit. In a sign that Brexit talks could go down to the wire EU sources said they want clarity from London by the end of Wednesday at the latest if there is to be a summit this month to approve a Brexit deal. However the Financial Times reported that the European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator Michael\\xa0Barnier\\xa0said the main elements of an exit treaty text were ready to present to the British cabinet on Tuesday citing unidentified diplomats briefed on the discussions. EU\\'s chief Brexit negotiator Barnier arrives at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels. Michel Barnier told ministers from the EU’s remaining 27 member states that \"the parameters of a possible agreement are very largely defined\" but still require political endorsement the FT said. May\\'s compromise plan which seeks to maintain close trade ties with the EU in the future is facing opposition from Brexiteers pro-Europeans the Northern Irish party that props up her government and even some of her own ministers. \"I think it\\'s the worst of all worlds\" former education minister Justine Greening who supported staying in the EU in the 2016 Brexit referendum told BBC radio adding that she did not think there was any chance it could get through parliament. A British official voiced pessimism about the possibility of a breakthrough with the EU this week due to continued deadlock on the issue of the border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. Sterling tumbled to a 1-1/2 week low of $1.2838 on fears of a possible no-deal Brexit that many investors fear will weaken the West panic markets and block the arteries of trade. Brexit talks with the EU ran through Sunday night until 2.45am and resumed on Monday morning. \"Technically speaking the text is ready. But there is no political agreement from their side\" a senior EU diplomat said. Economists polled by Reuters last week said there remains a one-in-four chance that London and Brussels will fail to reach a deal on the terms of departure. LONDON CALLING Both sides need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the world\\'s biggest trading bloc and the fifth largest national economy. The other 27 members of the EU combined have about five times the economic might of Britain. But May has struggled to untangle nearly 46 years of membership without damaging trade or upsetting the lawmakers who will ultimately decide the fate of any deal she can secure. \"We have made good progress in the negotiations in relation to the Withdrawal Agreement but there are substantial issues still to overcome in relation to the Northern Irish \"backstop\" that remains the case\" May\\'s spokesman said. The \"backstop\" is an insurance policy to ensure no return to border controls on the island of Ireland if a future EU-UK trading relationship cannot be agreed in time. \"The cabinet has backed the prime minister in moving forward with the negotiations with the EU and I expect cabinet will continue to do so\" May\\'s spokesman said. In Brussels the EU\\'s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told ministers from the other 27 EU member states that he was waiting for a signal that May has mustered enough votes to get a deal approved by parliament. If there is a breakthrough a Brexit summit could be called for November 24-25. \"It\\'s such a mess politically in Britain it\\'s hard to see at this stage how she can win support for the package\" said one diplomat. While May has for months faced fierce opposition from Brexit-supporting lawmakers who say she has betrayed the referendum result by seeking such close ties with the EU she is now facing increasing pressure from pro-Europeans too. Jo Johnson the younger brother of leading Brexiteer and former foreign minister Boris resigned from May\\'s government last Friday calling in a withering critique for another referendum to prevent her Brexit plans. If a deal is voted down by parliament the United Kingdom will face an uncertain future: leaving abruptly without a deal the collapse of May\\'s government an election or as some opponents of Brexit hope a new referendum. The EU is not currently working to include any second referendum in its Brexit planning sources in Brussels said. Brexiteers say leaving without a deal might be damaging in the short term but that in the longer term it would be better than signing up to obey rules from the EU for decades to come. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 14th 09:05  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Matthew Childs/ Reuters  Failing to maintain access for banks to the European Union market after Brexit would be an act of “economic sabotage” that would ripple across Britain London Mayor Sadiq Khan said yesterday. Banks in Britain have said they are preparing to move staff and activities to mainland Europe as soon as next year unless access to the bloc’s single market is maintained after Brexit. Khan made the remarks in a speech at a dinner in the City of London saying that mishandling Brexit might have the biggest impact on financial services since “Big Bang” deregulation 30 years ago. Businesses are more likely to move to New York Singapore and Hong Kong That event helped to propel London to the top of the global financial centre league tables a ranking that will be hard to keep without EU market access bankers have said. “If the proper agreements aren’t negotiated there will be serious knock-on impacts with jobs and billions of revenues lost – something that would hit the entire country not just London” Khan said. “It’s frustrating to say the least that much of what we are saying seems to be falling on deaf ears.” Khan a member of the opposition Labour Party called for Britain’s Conservative government to get a “unique” deal that would avoid denting financial services the economy’s single biggest sector. “If we fail to get a good Brexit deal businesses are more likely to move to New York Singapore and Hong Kong than to other cities in Europe” Khan said. A tenth of staff in the City are from other EU countries. Banks in London have an “EU passport” allowing them to operate freely across the bloc but bankers expect that after Brexit any access to the European market will be on less favourable terms than now. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30   \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Deutsche Bank is evaluating whether to move a large part of its securities trading business from London to Frankfurt or elsewhere in Europe as it prepares for Britain’s exit from the European Union a source told Reuters yesterday. Germany’s largest lender is considering creating a booking centre for non-UK transactions which are currently reported through London the person said on condition of anonymity because talks are ongoing and the plans not yet finalised. Deutsche Bank will make changes as Brexit negotiations unfold but the bank is preparing for a worst-case Brexit scenario that could entail a loss of so-called passporting rights between Britain and the EU the person said. Bloomberg News first reported details of plans for the booking centre on Wednesday. A handful of banks have recently said that they were setting up subsidiaries in Frankfurt as they prepare for Brexit including Nomura Holdings Inc\\xa0 and Daiwa Securities Group. It remains unclear how many of its staff could be moved in the implementation of such a plan over the next 18 months and Deutsche Bank is also exploring the option of transferring some roles to Berlin or other financial capitals in Europe.\\xa0 However Deutsche Bank board member Sylvie Matherat suggested in April that it could move as many as 4000 employees out of London as a result of Brexit. Its annual report showed it employed 8575 people in Britain out of 99744 worldwide at the end of 2016 with about €5 billion in revenue coming from the UK out of €30 billion globally. Deutsche Bank has signalled a vote of confidence in the British capital despite Brexit informing staff in March that it had chosen a new office for its London headquarters slated to open in 2023. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 14th 09:05  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

On Friday Dr Muscat told Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant that he sensed doubts about the decision to quit the EU beginning to creep in. “For the first time I’m starting to believe that Brexit will not happen. I am seeing hopeful signs that indicate things will change. I see encouraging signs that the tide is turning. I’m not saying the Brits have made a mistake but the mood is changing” he said. Dr Muscat acknowledged that the UK had voted to leave the EU but said that the referendum result had created a situation \"in which everyone loses\" and said history was full of examples when the people\\'s will had \"disastrous consequences\". \"It would be good if a political leader in the UK stands up and is courageous enough to address this new situation. Someone who says: let’s put the Brexit end-deal to a popular vote” the Prime Minister said.\\xa0 COSTLY BREXIT Dr Muscat said in today\\'s interview that hardly anyone in the EU was happy that Britain was leaving the bloc. In his view another referendum should be held where people should be asked if they agreed with the form of Brexit they were being offered.

Practially all EU leaders would like to see the UK hold a second referendum on Brexit Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has told a BBC interviewer. Dr Muscat is in Salzburg for an informal EU\\xa0leaders\\' meeting. “There is a unanimous – or almost unanimous I would say – point of view around the table that we would like the almost impossible to happen that the UK has another referendum\" Dr Muscat said. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has to date ruled out a second referendum despite growing pressure. She made her position clear once more when she addressed the EU\\xa0leaders while urging them to accept her latest\\xa0Brexit plan.\\xa0 Opinion polls suggest that a second run would see \\'Remainers\\'\\xa0triumph over the \\'Brexiteers\\' overturning the outcome of the first referendum.\\xa0 Dr Muscat said most EU\\xa0leaders would welcome the possibility of seeing the British people decide once and for all after putting things into perspective seeing what had been negotiated and what the options were.\\xa0\\xa0 The Maltese prime minister also stressed that a Brexit deal needs the UK to acknowledge EU rules. “There is room for manoeuvre on the EU side as long as it doesn’t tamper with our rules. If the UK is asking that that’s a big problem. That cannot happen”\\xa0 Dr Muscat said. The main sticking points to Theresa May\\'s Brexit\\xa0plans are the future trade and customs relationships and how trade between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland will be policed with the UK insisting there should not be a return to a hard border.\\xa0\\xa0 Dr Muscat had a formal meeting with Mrs May in London earlier this week.\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Updated 5.30pm Britain\\'s government cannot submit its Brexit deal for another vote in parliament if it is \"the same\" or \"substantially the same\" as the one already rejected by MPs the House of Commons speaker said on Monday. \"What the government cannot legitimately do is to re-submit to the House the same proposition or substantially the same proposition\" John Bercow told parliament. The move presents a problem for Prime Minister Theresa May who was expected to bring her unpopular deal back for a third time ahead of Thursday\\'s EU summit where she is to ask for a delay to the March 29 Brexit date. It is the first time in more than 100 years that the speaker has invoked the rule meaning the government must find a way of substantially altering the bill before it can be voted on. \"This convention is very strong and of long standing dating back to 2 April 1604\" said Bercow who added it was last used to stop a repeat vote in 1912. The speaker who has been accused of bias during the Brexit process said he allowed the deal to return to parliament last week despite its defeat in January as it \"contained a number of legal changes\" from the original. \"If the government wishes to bring forward a new proposition that is neither the same nor substantially the same as that disposed of by the House on March 12 this would be entirely in order\" said the speaker. May\\'s Downing Street office said it had no comment on Bercow\\'s announcement because \"we weren\\'t given any advance warning.\" The convention applies to motions submitted in the same parliamentary session. Brexit-supporting MP Jacob Rees-Mogg asked about the possibility of a parliamentary prorogue. That would require May to ask Queen Elizabeth II to break up parliament early before reconvening in a new session.\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

EU leader Jean-Claude Juncker vowed Wednesday to work until the last moment to prevent a \"no deal\" Brexit but admitted Britain crashing out now appears to be a likely result. Addressing the European Parliament after Prime Minister Theresa May asked for a short postponement Juncker said London remains on course for Brexit next week. But he added: \"The European Union will not kick any member state out. \"I will personally do everything I can to prevent a disorderly Brexit and I expect political leaders across the EU27 and in the United Kingdom to do the same.\" On Tuesday May asked opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to help develop a Brexit plan that could be ratified by the House of Commons and asked Brussels for more time. Juncker responded that EU leaders would be flexible but time is limited and a disorderly no-deal Brexit would only be welcomed by populist and nationalist forces. \"In light of Prime Minister May\\'s statement last night I believe we now have a few more days\" he said. \"If the United Kingdom is in a position to approve the withdrawal agreement with a sustainable majority by 12 April the European Union should be prepared to accept a delay until 22 May. \"Yet I believe that a \\'no deal\\' at midnight on the 12 April is now a very likely scenario.

Disruption to trade caused by Brexit could cost the average Briton as much as £1700 a year with Remain-backing areas bearing the brunt a report has claimed. The research suggested many of the worst-affected areas would be in the Remain-voting South East because their prosperity depends more heavily on services which are more sensitive than goods to trade barriers. The findings released by the London School of Economics Centre for Economic Performance are at odds with official Whitehall assessments that Leave-backing areas of the North East will pay the highest price for any disruption to trade. Unveiling his research at the Social Market Foundation think tank in London the LSE\\'s Nikhil Datta said a \"soft\" Norway-style Brexit where the UK remained in the European single market would result in annual economic growth being 1.3% lower over the next 10 years - around £850 per head of population. A \"hard\" Brexit where the UK leaves without a trade deal would mean growth being 2.7% lower over the period the equivalent of £1700 a person he said. This analysis shows that there are no immediate gains from Brexit only different degrees of loss Any benefit from new trade deals with countries such as the US or China will not have enough impact to offset the losses said Mr Datta. According to his calculations the area set to lose most from disruption to trade is the City of London which faces a 1.9% hit from a soft Brexit and 4.3% from a no-deal outcome. Next worst-affected areas would be Aberdeen City Tower Hamlets Watford Mole Valley in Surrey East Hertfordshire Reading Reigate and Banstead Worthing and Islington all of which voted to remain in the 2016 referendum he said. By contrast several of the areas that will pay the smallest price for Brexit - including Eden in Cumbria South Holland North Lincolnshire and Melton - all voted to Leave. SMF director James Kirkup said: \"This analysis shows that there are no immediate gains from Brexit only different degrees of loss. \"The fact that wealthier areas might lose more in the short run does not change the need for better support for skills growth and economic resilience in the poorer parts of Britain where Leave was most popular.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  British Prime Minister Theresa May warned her divided party on Sunday that there may be \"no Brexit at all\" if they wrecked her plan to forge a close relationship with the European Union after leaving the world\\'s biggest trading bloc. \"My message to the country this weekend is simple: we need to keep our eyes on the prize\" May wrote on Facebook. \"If we don’t we risk ending up with no Brexit at all.\" Linking the fate of Brexit to her own survival in such an explicit way indicates just how precarious May\\'s position remains after her government was thrust into crisis and US President Donald Trump publicly criticised her Brexit strategy. With less than nine months to go before the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on March 29 2019 the country the political elite and business leaders are still deeply divided over whether Brexit should take place and if so how. May doesn\\'t yet have a Brexit deal with the EU so the British government has stepped up planning for a so called \"no deal\" Brexit that could spook financial markets and dislocate trade flows across Europe and beyond. READ: After damning her Brexit\\xa0plan Trump talks up his relationship with May May has repeatedly said Brexit will happen and has ruled out a rerun of the 2016 referendum although French President Emmanuel Macron and billionaire investor George Soros have suggested that Britain could still change its mind. In an attempt to forge a balance between those seeking a smooth Brexit and those who fear staying too close to the EU\\'s orbit would undermine the very nature of Brexit May sought the approval of senior ministers for her plans on July 6. After hours of talks at her Chequers country residence she appeared to have won over her cabinet but just two days later David Davis resigned as Brexit secretary followed by her foreign minister Boris Johnson the next day. May called on Sunday for the country to back her plan for \"friction-free movement of goods\" saying it was the only option to avoid undermining the peace in Northern Ireland and preserving the unity of the United Kingdom. Davis writing in the Sunday Times said it was an \"astonishingly dishonest claim\" to say there is no worked-out alternative to May\\'s plan. He said her plan would allow EU regulations to harm British manufacturers. \"Be in no doubt: under the government\\'s proposal our fingers would still be caught in this mangle and the EU would use it ruthlessly to punish us for leaving and handicap our future competitiveness\" Davis said. Steve Baker a senior lawmaker who served as a deputy to Davis in the Brexit ministry said May had presided over a \"cloak and dagger\" plot to undermine Brexit. May\\'s position was further undermined by Trump who said in an interview published in Rupert Murdoch\\'s Sun newspaper on Friday that her proposals would probably kill off any chance of a post-Brexit trade deal with the world\\'s biggest economy. Though Trump later contradicted his comments by then promising a great US trade deal the president made clear his admiration for the 54-year-old Johnson who Trump said would one day make a great British prime minister. Steve Bannon Trump\\'s former adviser was even quoted by Britain\\'s Daily Telegraph as saying that it was now time for Johnson to challenge May for her job. \"Now is the moment\" the\\xa0Telegraph quoted Bannon Trump’s former strategist and a key player in his 2016 election campaign as saying. \"If Boris Johnson looks at this... There comes an inflection point the Chequers deal was an inflection point we will have to see what happens\" Bannon said. Johnson the face of the Brexit campaign for many has remained silent in public since he warned in his resignation letter on July 9 that the \"Brexit dream\" was being suffocated by needless self-doubt. The Telegraph newspaper said Johnson had re-joined the newspaper as a columnist with effect from Monday. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 14th 09:05  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britons are seeking a break from the endless Brexit debate by heading to their local for a pint pub operator Greene King said on Thursday as it reported an increase in profit over the last six months. The pub operator which brews beers such as Greene King IPA and Old Speckled Hen said that it was making contingency plans to protect against disruption if Britain leaves the trading bloc next March without a deal. \"People are bored from Brexit and that\\'s actually translating to pubs benefiting our like to like sales are up 2.9% so not all consumer facing businesses are suffering in the run up to Brexit\" Chief Executive Officer Rooney Anand told reporters. \"Pubs are benefiting in some respects from every time we turn on the television radio or read the newspaper all you hear about is Brexit and it doesn\\'t really take you forward.\" Greene King pretax profit rose 3.2% to 127.7 million pounds ($163.84 million) for the 24 weeks to October 14 - the first half of its financial year. The company also said comparable sales for Pub Company through which it manages its chain of 2900 pubs restaurants and hotels had risen 2.7%. Comparable sales at Pub Company were up 2.9% in the six weeks since the half-year point and Christmas bookings are well ahead of last year. The company has been battling rising costs from a minimum wage increase higher property prices and a Brexit-driven slide in the pound. Greene King shares rose 6.5% to 540.4 pence at 0945 GMT pushing them to the top on London\\'s midcap index. The company said it has identified key areas of risk to its business from a \"no deal\" outcome and is working closely with its supply chain partners to safeguard the supply of goods to its pubs and breweries as well as the export of beers. Greene King is the latest British company to announce preparations for the risk of interruptions to the flow of goods and parts across borders once Britain leaves the European Union next March. Anand declined to give details about the company\\'s Brexit planning. \"I don\\'t want to go into that because that\\'s quite unique and specific to Greene King ... we are a large customer of many of those domestic suppliers and we\\'re making sure we\\'re ahead of the queue\" he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain can only avoid a hard Brexit on March 29 if it reaches a deal with the EU to resolve the tricky Irish backstop issue Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Wednesday. \"This is really the only way through the current situation\" he said in a speech in Berlin adding that pushing back the Brexit deadline would leave both the UK and EU in \"paralysis\". The infamous \"Irish backstop\" clause provides for Britain to remain in the EU customs union until a way is found - such as a future free trade deal - to ensure that Ireland\\'s border with Northern Ireland remains open. Resolving the issue would allow the government to gain parliamentary support for the EU divorce deal and also guarantee the 1998 Belfast peace agreement he predicted. \"If we can make that change we are confident we can get the deal through\" parliament he said on the day Prime Minister Theresa May was headed back to Brussels to renew her quest to reopen the terms of the Brexit divorce. Brexiteers in May\\'s own Conservative party see the backstop as a \"trap\" to keep Britain in a form of union indefinitely and have demanded a time limit or a unilateral exit clause. This would be seen in Brussels as a betrayal of EU member Ireland and it has consistently got short shrift from EU officials. Hunt speaking on the question of a possible extension on Britain leaving the bloc questioned whether that \"really solves anything\".\\xa0 \"I think the last thing that people in the UK and indeed the rest of the EU want is Brexit paralysis with this issue hanging over Europe like a shadow\" he said.\\xa0 \"I think people want to move on and they want to demonstrate that we can have a Brexit that respects the referendum result but also that we remain best of friends with our neighbours in Europe.\" May and the other 27 EU leaders approved a Brexit withdrawal agreement at a summit on November 25 last year but the British leader\\'s own parliament rejected it on January 15. Since then May and her ministers have repeatedly met EU leaders and their negotiator Michel Barnier to urge them to reopen the text to find a way to appease eurosceptic MPs. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 14th 09:05  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Rebecca Naden/Reuters  Above a factory floor of machines carving metal to within a millionth of a metre Stephen Cheetham is preparing his company for the unknown: a British exit from the European Union. Since the government announced a referendum on Britain’s future in Europe Cheetham has deferred investment decisions put off expensive hiring and even bought equipment with his own money to avoid straining the balance sheet. The aim is to prepare his company which makes parts for first-class airline seats and intricate scientific equipment for what he fears will be a slump in business if Britain votes to leave the world’s biggest trading bloc. “It is extremely difficult to prepare for and it worries me witless” said the owner of PK Engineering. “But our disaster plan is very clear: if all the kit is paid for we hang on to it and we ditch everybody apart from the core.” Britain’s big listed companies have appointed lawyers and strategists to identify the risks of a British exit or Brexit. Wary of meddling in politics however they have largely not detailed their plans for the June 23 vote. Facing so many unknowns business owners are struggling to plan for the future But smaller companies in the manufacturing heartlands crucial to the economy and often inextricably linked to continental Europe are formulating contingency plans that illustrate the risks facing businesses across the country and the steps being taken to mitigate them. At the start of 2015 almost half of Britain’s private-sector turnover came from firms that employed fewer than 249 people according to the Department for Business. For Cheetham his “disaster plan” involves jettisoning nearly half of his 30 employees if a Brexit compounds the drag from an already slowing global economy at his firm in the English rural town of Hereford. Across the nearby Welsh border Gareth Jenkins who runs a tool-making firm has identified which major customers in Europe are likely to abandon him should they have to accept higher costs or slower delivery times that might come from new border controls with EU countries if Britain leaves the bloc. He has calculated the financial impact and says in a worst-case scenario he could lose 25 per cent of his turnover. He plans to tell his 91 employees in the next couple of weeks that a vote to leave could force him to lay off a quarter of staff. Very little is clear ahead of the referendum called by Prime Minister David Cameron with British voters divided on membership and both sides in the debate arguing Britain would be financially better off if their cause succeeds. The fears of business owners like Cheetham and Jenkins are driven by what most Britons – on either side of the debate – accept is unchartered economic territory should Britain vote to leave the group it joined 43 years ago. The terms of any divorce would be subject to two years of negotiations with the EU with no guarantees of how the new order would look. At present British companies trading with other EU nations do not face customs tariffs costly paperwork such as certificates of origin or VAT – sales tax – on imports. Should it opt to leave Britain may negotiate continued tariff-free access but additional administrative burdens will almost certainly apply making exporting to and importing from the EU more costly say business owners and lawyers. They also fear any restrictions on European workers and a prolonged period of a volatile pound while the effect on the EU of losing its second-largest economy is unclear. Adam Shuter head of haulier Exact Logistics is investigating whether he should set up a German office which he thinks could cost less than the additional taxes and paperwork of serving EU customers from outside the bloc. “For a small business it’s quite a bit of investment” he said. “It just adds a layer of administration.” He is also gauging the extra customs costs his British customers might incur outside the EU using non-members Norway and Switzerland as guides and looking at how much it would cost to set up expensive software to handle border clearances. He charges an additional £50 to £60 per consignment for customs clearance into those two countries on top of a typical European delivery cost of £40 to £50. A spokesman for Vote Leave one of the groups campaigning for Britain to leave the EU said the concerns were unfounded. The group argues companies would benefit from fewer regulations imposed by Brussels while the government could be more nimble in agreeing trade deals with the likes of India China and the US. “The UK is the EU’s largest market so every incentive exists for the UK to strike a free trade deal with the EU while using its new-found control to also strike free trade deals across the world” it said. Cheetham’s focus is closer to home. He bought PK Engineering in Hereford close to England’s border with Wales four years ago after a career in the automotive and finance industry. With its £1.5 million turnover and 10000-square-foot factory he says he is too small to employ consultants or lawyers ahead of the vote. Like many of Britain’s high-precision manufacturers most of PK’s goods – 90 per cent – are exported to global supply chains ending up at the likes of Boeing’s factory in Seattle or Airbus’s base in Toulouse. “You think we’re a rural business?” asks Cheetham of his 27-year-old firm based on a small industrial park nestled in rolling countryside 190km west of London. “If we screw up Boeing in Seattle stops or Airbus in Toulouse stops... it’s all interconnected.” Clutching a component of an airline seat in his right hand the 58-year-old details how the aluminium came from Finland and the fittings from Germany to meet an order from a French customer in Wales who will send it on to Toulouse or Seattle. To his left is a large folder detailing the certification process the firm went through to allow it to win work in the aerospace sector. Known as the Aerospace Quality Certification AS9100C the six-month process cost about £320000 . The EU contributed to that cost in its bid to improve productivity and competitiveness in the bloc and Cheetham said it would have taken much longer to complete had he needed to stump up all the cash. Leaving the bloc Cheetham worries that his firm could miss out on this kind of advantage and become less competitive. “Our ability to increase prices is very limited – whenever we try we lose work” he said. Any move that led to British manufacturing firms losing their place in global supply chains would deal a major blow to the British economy; the sector accounts for a tenth of its output and employs 2.65 million people the vast majority in small- and medium-sized firms. Facing so many unknowns business owners such as Cheetham are struggling to plan for the future. Normally a supporter of Cameron’s Conservatives he says he is furious at the position the government has put business owners in. “They are playing roulette with the economic future of the country” he says hands gripping the table. “We’re just hoping for the best. I’m almost in denial.” (Reuters) \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Prime Minister David Cameron and his eurosceptic opponents are crisscrossing Britain today in a final push for votes on the eve of a close-run referendum on European Union membership. The vote which echoes the rise of populism in Europe and the United States will shape the future of Europe. A victory for \"out\" could unleash turmoil on financial markets. \"It\\'s very close; nobody knows what\\'s going to happen\" Prime Minister David Cameron told the Financial Times with opinion polls showing the rival camps neck and neck. Tomorrow\\'s vote will take place a week after the murder of ardently pro-EU lawmaker Jo Cox shocked the country raising questions about the tone of an increasingly bitter campaign. Much of the debate has boiled down to two issues: the economy and immigration. The City of London the International Monetary Fund and the majority of British business leaders back Cameron and his Remain camp\\'s stance that to leave the EU would plunge Britain into recession costing jobs and raising prices. Those supporting a \"Brexit\" have struck a chord with many voters by saying Britain would regain control of immigration if it cut itself loose from a bloc they regard as domineering and out of touch. Both camps have been accused of using unfounded assertions and scare tactics. In one of the last debates London\\'s newly elected mayor Sadiq Khan accused Boris Johnson the main leader of the Leave campaign of exploiting fears of immigration to stoke anti-EU opinions. \"Your campaign hasn\\'t been \\'project fear\\' it\\'s been \\'project hate\\' as far as immigration is concerned\" Khan said to huge applause from the 6000 crowd at a live TV debate at London\\'s Wembley Arena on Tuesday night. Johnson favourite with bookmakers to replace Cameron if Leave wins told the cheering audience: \"This Thursday can be our country\\'s independence day.\" Johnson Khan\\'s Conservative predecessor as mayor of London said the Remain camp spoke of nothing but fear and was \"rubbishing\" Britain. He planned to travel across Britain in a helicopter on Wednesday to try to mobilise voters. Opinion polls have painted a contradictory picture of public opinion in a deeply divided nation. But some published since Cox\\'s murder have suggested a slight lead for Remain though often within the margin of error. A man accused of her murder gave his name as \"death to traitors freedom for Britain\" when he appeared in court on Saturday. Cox\\'s husband said on Tuesday his wife had been killed because of her strong political views. The implied probability of a Remain vote was at 76 percent according to Betfair odds while the pound edged back to $1.4659 after climbing to as high as $1.4788 yesterday its highest level since 4 January.\\xa0 Polling stations open at 6am (GMT) tomorrow and close at 9pm (GMT). The official result is due some time after 6am (GMT) on Friday but partial results and turnout figures from 382 counting centres will be announced from about 1am (GMT).\\xa0 World leaders including U.S. President Barack Obama Chinese President Xi Jinping German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the NATO and Commonwealth allies have urged Britain to remain in the EU. Some have warned of the drawbacks of isolation. France\\'s government spokesman said on Wednesday Britain would lose access to the EU\\'s prized single market if it voted to quit and ceased paying into the common budget. BREXIT? Cameron who called the referendum under pressure in his own Conservative party and from the insurgent anti-EU UK Independence Party urged voters to remain in the club Britain joined in 1973. \"If we leave we will diminish our country and our ability to get things done in the world\" he told supporters in Bristol in western England. \"We\\'ve got one day left to hammer out that message; stronger safer better off. Please give it everything you\\'ve got in these last hours to make sure that people go out and vote tomorrow.\" \"This Thursday can be our country\\'s independence day\" Boris Johnson told Leave supporters. Photo: Reuters The prime minister\\'s fate hangs on the result. A vote to leave would almost certainly lead to his exit from the top job though he has said he will stay. But even a narrow vote to remain could undermine his authority and shorten his term. The bosses of 51 of the FTSE 100 British companies and 1285 business leaders who together employ 1.75 million people signed a joint letter to The Times urging voters to remain. \"Britain leaving the EU would mean uncertainty for our firms less trade with Europe and fewer jobs\" they said. \"Britain remaining in the EU would mean the opposite: more certainty more trade and more jobs.\" A vote to leave could unleash turmoil on foreign exchange equity and bond markets lead to a political crisis in Britain and fragment the post-Cold War European order. London-based money transfer website Transferwise said it was suspending pound transfers on Thursday in anticipation of currency volatility. The EU would have to weather the exit of its No.2 economy representing $2.9 trillion of its gross domestic product the only European financial capital to rival New York and one of its only two nuclear powers while Britain\\'s economy could stall. A vote to remain would trigger a rise in sterling and relief in Western capitals unleash pent-up investment in Britain but still leave the country -- and the Conservatives -- bitterly divided especially if the margin of victory were thin. Investment bank Citi estimated in a research note there was a 60 per cent chance Britons would vote to stay in the EU but said a \"close remain\" could still undermine political stability in both the United Kingdom and the 28-country bloc. \"A vote to \\'Leave\\' would have major repercussions in global financial markets the economy and politics triggering substantial downward revisions of UK and European growth forecasts\" Citi said. Meanwhile bookmaker William Hill said about 20 million pounds had been staked on the outcome of the referendum across the industry with two-thirds of the money staked on a vote to remain in the EU. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

It was finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with Japan Germany the US Italy and others.\\xa0 The UK and specifically the City of London which is not the same thing as the London Metropolis and which holds a very privileged status within Britain sought to reinvent itself through financial engineering. It thus went on to become a global financial powerhouse.\\xa0 In the 1970s the UK was economically in the doldrums and had become an economic backwater. It needed bailing out by the IMF. It had strong arguments to apply for inclusion in the EEC at the time.\\xa0 The UK includes all of its overseas territories such as the British Virgin Islands the Cayman Islands Bermuda and Gibraltar. Then there are the Channel Islands which are also Crown dependencies and not constitutionally independent. All of these and other overseas territories fall under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom. They are remnants of the British Empire that have either not been granted independence or have voted to remain British territories. Together these form part of an extremely powerful network of tax havens falling under British sovereignty. They are repositories of literally trillions of pounds in financial assets. The UK has been fighting the EU tooth and nail to protect its tax haven regime.\\xa0 Together with the US that has its own tax haven powerhouses even on the mainland itself the two nations have enormous influence and control over global finance. They hold the lion’s share of global financial assets. We simply have no idea of the enormous extent and repercussions of all this. We see only the tip of the iceberg. The US also has considerable influence over Panama another huge tax haven which some argue is a de facto satellite of the US. One of president George Bush senior’s first major foreign policy moves was to invade this tiny state in 1989. And financially speaking for good reason.\\xa0 This former director of the CIA cum president chose an interesting code name for the invasion Operation Just Cause. Oh how sweet! Nothing like good old smoke and mirrors and the Pharisee playing the role of the Good Samaritan to further one’s none too ignoble cause in the world of geopolitics. So what has all this got to do with Brexit and the power elite? By the latter I do not mean the members of Parliament but the unelected financial and industrial powers sitting behind all thrones. These pull strings foment strife and engineer conflicts on the grand chessboards of geopolitics and the amassing of vast wealth. Like the pirates of old seeking to hide their ill-begotten gains in some treasure chests in the Caribbean and other hideaways billionaires and their corporations have buried away their own treasure chests often in the same part of the world ironically far from the prying eyes of mainland Europe among others.\\xa0 Another part of that irony is that while piracy theft tax evasion and fraud are still all illegal the mechanisms for pirates to ‘legitimately’ bury their illicit treasure chests are not.\\xa0 There has however been growing pressure mounting to close in on the receptacles of these hidden treasure chests. If new laws are passed across Europe to this effect where would that leave Britain’s tax havens? I would say somewhere between in the soup and up the creak. Or somewhere between Devil’s Island and the crystal blue sea of the Caribbean. While piracy theft tax evasion and fraud are still all illegal the mechanisms for pirates to ‘legitimately’ bury their illicit treasure chests are not If there is one thing that we can be sure of it is that the billionaires club has no intention whatsoever of seeing its vast trillions vanish into thin air or of doing jail time. If I were a British or European billionaire pirate hiding my treasures in the British Overseas Territories I would be most happy to see Britain leave the EU. It would be there across the channel and in the Caribbean safely out of the reach of the European tax regulators.\\xa0 If I were a non-British EU national it would create no problem for me from a movement point of view. If I were British then I would just buy myself an EU passport. I would get to have my cake and eat it; something we are not totally unfamiliar with at this stage of the game. Furthermore there would be richer pickings for the owners of large corporations in Britain if that country subsequently relaxes its environment and labour laws.\\xa0 Many people in the northern economically depressed areas of England voted out. Did many of them feel that they were missing out on the European dream and the cookies? I am pretty sure some of them did. But who is controlling the flow of cookies to northern England anyway? Is it Brussels or London?\\xa0 The richer south on the other hand around the London area largely voted to stay in. I guess they were happy with their cookies not exactly shared equally with their fellow countrymen up north. The Scots of course also voted out unlike the Englishmen just south of the border. They seem to have benefitted more in Europe than the northern English. But herein lies the irony. People who have it good tend to vote to retain the status quo. Those less comfortable tend to want to change it. Give them a chance to vote for change and they jump to the occasion no matter how it is packaged.\\xa0 An angler who has caught nothing for hours in one place tends to move to another spot not really knowing if his luck would change. The angler who keeps reeling in prize-winning specimens tends to hold his ground. He glares at any other angler who dares come close. He would not want to relinquish or share his spot. So where do the billionaires with their billions stand in all this debacle? Do they stand to gain or to lose with Brexit? They may ramble on about the economy and what may be more beneficial. But ultimately they think and act in accordance with what suits their pocket privacy and reputation like the general flow of the population.\\xa0 Losing his tax havens would be a billionaire’s disaster.\\xa0 So why on earth should he give a rodent’s behind about how Britain might fare out of Europe? As long as he would have his overseas territory hideaway to stash all his hidden treasure and stay out of court away from prosecution he is really alright Jack!\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Rodolfo Ragonesi is a lawyer and researcher in history and international affairs.

Just five years later they did so holding a vote that ensured the UK remained a member of what was then the EEC for more than four decades. The decision taken two-and-a-half years ago in the 2016 referendum reversed the verdict the public arrived at back in 1975. But so controversial has it become and so difficult to implement that many are calling for what would be a third “people’s vote”. Opposition to another referendum is intense – and not just among those desperate to see the UK leave the EU. Many who would in their heart of hearts prefer to remain in the EU worry that seeking to overturn the 2016 result would send a damaging message to “the people”.\\xa0The so-called Norway-plus option which would see the UK remain in the customs union and the single market is now the safest life raft available For some the so-called Norway-plus option which would see the UK remain in the customs union and the single market is now the safest life raft available. Prime Minister Theresa May has lost the meaningful vote and it is increasingly clear that parliament by hook or by crook is going to do its damnedest to prevent a no-deal departure. We can therefore expect to hear a lot more in the coming days about Norway-plus – and about the EEA EFTA “cross-party consensus” and a so-called “soft” (or “softer”) Brexit. Whether any of this is feasible – at least in the time available and with May still prime minister – who knows? But what we do know is that if it is to stand any chance of working then advocates of the Norway-plus option are going to have to work very hard and very fast to persuade both the public and the members of Britain’s two biggest political parties that it’s something worth trying. How much chance do they have? Just before Christmas Our ESRC-sponsored Party Members Project surveyed 1034 Labour Party members and 1215 Conservative Party members together with a representative sample of 1675 ordinary voters. We asked all three groups of respondents how they would feel if Britain “ended up leaving the European Union but remaining in the single market and customs union – an arrangement that is sometimes called Norway-plus”. Their answers suggest the latter won’t necessarily be an easy sell – but that it shouldn’t be written off. Let’s take party members first. Perhaps predictably given how keen they are on a hard Brexit the Tory grassroots are going to take a heck of a lot of persuading. Norway-plus would leave 23% of grassroots Tories feeling “disappointed” 11% “angry” and a whopping 38% feeling “betrayed”. And if you look at the three-quarters of Tory members who voted Leave back in 2016 those proportions rise to 21% 13% and an even more whopping 49% respectively.  What about Labour members? Arguably their views should be taken seriously since Norway-plus will only really become an option if Labour MPs – the people Labour members help select – decide to support it. Our survey suggests that if they do then they might well be able to claim some grassroots sympathy if not outright support.\\xa0Norway-plus would leave 23% of grassroots Tories feeling “disappointed” 11% “angry” and a whopping 38% feeling “betrayed” Recalling that some 82% of Labour’s rank and file said they’d feel “delighted” “pleased” or “relieved” should the UK end up holding a second referendum and voting to remain in the EU we shouldn’t expect them to be particularly gung-ho about Norway-plus since it would still mean the country leaving the European Union. However only 24% of Labour members said such a second-best outcome would make them feel disappointed angry or betrayed compared to 52% who said they’d feel relatively positive. That said only 3% chose “delighted” as opposed to 12% saying “pleased” and 37% “relieved”.  What about voters? Well as one might expect it rather depends on whether they voted Leave or Remain in 2016. Norway-plus would leave 43% of those who voted Remain feeling relatively positive (either delighted pleased or relieved) with 26% feeling relatively negative (disappointed angry or betrayed). For Leavers however it’s a very different story: only 20% would feel positive about such an outcome compared to 45% who would feel negative.  That said and possibly very significantly the scale of disappointment (19%) anger (6%) and betrayal (20%) that Leave voters would feel in the event of a Norway-plus outcome comes nowhere near that which would be felt by paid-up Tory members. Nor interestingly would the disappointment (21%) anger (5%) and betrayal (17%) that would be felt by Tory voters rather than Tory members. For their part Labour voters like Labour members could probably live with Norway-plus. True only 40% said they’d feel delighted pleased or relieved. But that’s considerably more than the 26% who picked disappointed angry or betrayed. And if we return finally to look at voters as a whole – this time irrespective of whether they voted Leave or Remain Tory or Labour – then those who advocate Norway-plus might have at least some cause for optimism. Fewer than a third overall expressed negative feelings (17% disappointed 4% angry and 10% betrayed). And although that was more than the quarter or so of voters who expressed positive feelings (2% delighted 10% pleased and 17% relieved) we should note that some 16% of voters said they “wouldn’t mind either way” while some 21% said they didn’t know how they’d feel. In other words it looks as if possibly nearly two-thirds of voters and almost certainly a majority of them could probably live with Norway-plus. But before its advocates get too excited they need to heed what may be one enormous crucial caveat. Our survey noted that Norway-plus involved staying in the customs union and the single market. However it did not remind voters that the latter would mean continuing to allow EU citizens the unfettered right to live and work in the UK. Were it to be made clear to the public that Norway-plus did not mean they could “take back control” of Britain’s borders their reaction might well be very very different.

Sterling and bond yields rose yesterday as traders tried to assess whether the killing of a pro-EU British lawmaker may change the balance of opinions in Britain’s impending referendum on European Union membership. After a tumultuous week US stocks were lower in early New York trading though MSCI’s all-country world stock index was up 0.5 per cent and the FTSEuro\\xadfirst 300 gained 1.1 per cent. Campaigning for Britain’s June 23 EU referendum which overshadowed this week’s US and Japanese central bank meetings was put on hold after British Member of Parliament Jo Cox was shot dead on Thursday. Concerns Britain would cause turmoil in the global economy and European politics by voting to leave the 28-country bloc had rattled markets and caused the pound to tumble earlier this week. “This is people adjusting positions because they don’t know what’s going to happen” said Marc Chandler global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. The sterling was last up 0.58 per cent at $1.4285 up from Thursday’s lows of 1.4010. Analysts noted that Ms Cox’s death could generate sentiment in favour of remaining in the EU. US benchmark Treasury yields were on track for their first gain in nearly two weeks as fears of a British exit from the EU eased somewhat. The 10-year Treasury note fell 13/32 in price to yield 1.608 per cent. Yields are on track for their first rise since June 6. US stocks were lower on lingering worries about global growth. The S&P 500 snapped a five-day losing streak on Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 87.73 points or 0.49 per cent to 17645.37 the S&P 500 lost 10.51 points or 0.51 per cent to 2067.48 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 43.39 points or 0.9 per cent to 4801.52. Oil which has been a major driver of the sharp swings in global markets this year also helped shift the mood as it rose for the first time in seven sessions. Brent crude futures were up $1.34 at $48.53 a barrel while US crude rose $1.31 to $47.52. The two contracts were set to end the week roughly 3.5-four per cent lower. Gold also advanced with spot gold rising to $1292.90 after wild swings overnight. It was on track for a third week of gains. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May will renew attempts to push through her Brexit plan after she dramatically offered to quit to save her deal and MPs failed in their own bid to break the deadlock. At risk of losing control of the process of leaving the European Union the leader announced she would resign if parliament finally backed her withdrawal agreement. The offer came just hours before the House of Commons took part in an unprecedented series of votes to seek an alternative plan - but all eight proposals failed to find a majority highlighting divisions among MPs. Brexit minister Steve Barclay said the outcome \"strengthens our view that the deal our government has negotiated is the best option\". MPs have twice rejected May\\'s Brexit deal both times by large majorities prompting the leader to announce what is expected to be her final offer. \"I know there is a desire for a new approach - and new leadership - in the second phase of the Brexit negotiations and I won\\'t stand in the way of that\" she told a packed meeting of her Conservative MPs. \"But we need to get the deal through and deliver Brexit. I am prepared to leave this job earlier than I intended in order to do what is right for our country and our party.\" There are signs of softening among her rebel MPs with a number of Eurosceptics performing a U-turn including former foreign secretary Boris Johnson - a likely contender to replace May - who told fellow MPs on Wednesday he would support the deal. But her offer may not be enough to win round some hardliners including a group of Conservatives reported to call themselves \"The Spartans\" who are still holding out - as is the Democratic Unionist Party the Northern Irish party which props up May\\'s government. The DUP says the \"backstop\" plan in the deal to keep open the border with EU member Ireland after Brexit poses an \"unacceptable threat\" to the United Kingdom\\'s political union. The opposition Labour and Scottish National parties are also against the deal. \\'Back me and sack me\\'\\xa0 Britain\\'s Daily Mail newspaper questioned whether her \"sacrifice\" would be in vain while the Guardian called her resignation offer \"a stitch-up for a bad deal\". The i newspaper summed up her offer with the headline \"Back me and sack me\" adding that she had ignited a Conservative Party leadership contest. May agreed with the EU last week to delay Brexit amid fears Britain was heading for a potentially catastrophic \"no deal\" exit on Friday. Downing Street has hopes of returning its deal to MPs for a third vote this week but said it would only do this if it believed it would win. If her deal is passed by MPs Brexit will happen on May 22 - but if not she must return to Brussels before April 12 to explain what happens next. Frustrated by May\\'s refusal to change strategy backbench MPs staged their own series of votes. MPs were asked to vote yes or no to eight options but there was no majority for any of them. A plan for a new customs union with the EU after Brexit came closest defeated by a slim margin of 272 votes to 264 but May has repeatedly ruled out this option. A proposal to put May\\'s deal if agreed to a \"confirmatory\" public vote also came close to passing defeated by 295 to 268 votes - a result that drew huge cheers in the Commons. Time has now been set aside on Monday for MPs to try and whittle down the most popular options - however the motions are not binding on May.

Prime Minister Theresa May said on Monday she would bring her Brexit deal back to parliament for a vote in mid-January pledging to get assurances from the European Union to break the deadlock over Britain\\'s departure from the bloc. After a last-minute threat from the main opposition Labour Party to call for a symbolic no confidence vote in the prime minister if no date was given May said parliament would debate the deal in January before a vote in the week beginning January 14. May is pressing on with her deal to leave the EU rejecting calls for a second referendum or to test support for different Brexit options in parliament despite hardening opposition to the agreement to maintain close ties. After a tumultuous week in which she survived a confidence vote and sought last-minute changes to a Brexit agreement reached with Brussels last month May said again that the choice was her deal leaving without an agreement or no Brexit at all. \"I know this is not everyone’s perfect deal. It is a compromise. But if we let the perfect be the enemy of the good then we risk leaving the EU with no deal\" she told lawmakers her speech punctuated by loud shouts of protest. \"Avoiding no deal is only possible if we can reach an agreement or if we abandon Brexit entirely.\" A demonstrator holds a placard during an anti-Brexit protest opposite the Houses of Parliament in London. She said the EU had offered \"further clarification\" on the most contentious aspects of her divorce deal or withdrawal agreement and that her government was exploring \"further political and legal assurances\". But with the EU offering little in the way of concessions to win over lawmakers an increasing number of politicians are calling for a second referendum - something some of her ministers say could be avoided if the government tested Brexit scenarios in parliamentary votes. Parliament deeply divided Parliament is deeply divided with factions pressing for different options for future ties exiting without a deal or remaining in the EU. May and her ministers have repeatedly ruled out a replay of the referendum saying it would deepen rifts and betray voters who backed Brexit by 52 percent to 48 percent in 2016. That increases the risk of Britain leaving without a deal on March 29 a scenario some businesses fear would be catastrophic for the world\\'s fifth largest economy. The political and economic uncertainty over Brexit is having an impact with data on Monday showing a drop in consumer spending falling house prices and growing pessimism in household finances. Several members of May\\'s cabinet team including Education Minister Damian Hinds said at the weekend they were open to putting the range of options to parliament to gauge whether there was a majority for any of them. May\\'s spokesman said: \"In relation to an indicative vote there are no plans to hold one.\" The prime minister used her statement in parliament on Monday to reject the idea of a second referendum and to again set out that her agreement to keep close economic ties with the EU after Brexit is the only one on offer. \"Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum\" May said. \"Another vote which would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics because it would say to millions who trusted in democracy that our democracy does not deliver. Another vote which would likely leave us no further forward than the last.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Britain\\'s property market would crash and mortgage rates spiral up in the event of a chaotic no-deal Brexit with house prices falling 35 percent over three years Bank of England Governor Mark Carney told ministers The Times newspaper reported. The United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29 and yet little is clear. There is so far no full exit agreement between Brussels and London and some rebels in Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Conservative Party have threatened to vote down a deal if she clinches one. Details of Carney\\'s briefing to the cabinet on Thursday were reported by British newspapers including the Financial Times The Times and the Guardian. The Bank of England declined to comment and it was unclear what assumptions Carney\\'s models were based on. According to The Guardian Carney warned the ministers including May that the impact of a chaotic no-deal Brexit could be as catastrophic as the 2008 financial crisis. \"Our job is to prepare for the worst not hope for the best\" Carney a former Goldman Sachs banker who has run the Bank of England since 2013 wrote in an opinion piece for the Daily Mail. \"By identifying the risks and coming forward with solutions the Bank is working hard every day to get our financial system in shape for Brexit whatever form it takes\" The piece did not mention a house price crash or the 35 percent figure reported by the Times. Carney is due to speak in Dublin at 1000 GMT. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was due to speak by phone to EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Friday. Many business chiefs and investors fear politics could get in the way of Brexit thrusting the world\\'s fifth largest economy into a \"no-deal\" divorce they say would weaken the West spook financial markets and clog up the arteries of trade. In recent months May\\'s government has stepped up planning for a no-deal Brexit and has underscored the disruption that such a move would cause to businesses and the public. Without a deal the UK would move from seamless trade with the rest of the EU to customs arrangements set by the World Trade Organization for external states with no preferential deals. In one note of optimism Carney said that if May struck a Brexit deal on the basis of her \"Chequers\" proposals then the economy would outperform current forecasts because it would be better than the bank’s assumed outcome the FT said. Brexit crash? Carney whose term of office was this week extended until the end of January 2020 to deal with Brexit disruption told ministers a chaotic exit would lead to a plunge in sterling that would drive up inflation and interest rates The Times said. Further the Bank of England would be unable to soften the crisis by cutting interest rates because of the inflationary impact of such a move Carney told ministers according to the Financial Times. If Carney\\'s worst-case scenario were to come to pass then such a crash in house prices would spell political death for any prime minister though there was scepticism about the reports from his opponents and some economists. \"Carney has made himself a laughing stock in the City with such an outrageous warning\" said Richard Tice a Brexit supporter who is co chair of the \"Leave Means Leave\" group. \"Carney is a political central banker who is talking down the country and talking down Brexit in the hope that people accept a really bad Brexit deal - May\\'s Chequers deal.\" Unreliable boyfriend? Carney sometimes nicknamed the \"unreliable boyfriend\" due to mixed signals about the future path of interest rates gained respect from some investors for his actions to calm markets in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 Brexit vote. Britain\\'s central bank stress-tested lenders against a 33 percent house price fall last year and some economists questioned whether Carney\\'s comments to ministers had been reported accurately. \"Carney reported comments on UK house prices not remotely credible BUT I also think highly unlikely they were made as reported\" said Simon French chief economist at Panmure Gordon merchant bank in London. UK house prices fell 19 percent peak to trough during the 2008 financial crisis but then rose by 38 percent from their low in March 2009 to June 2016 the month of the shock Brexit referendum result. In the two years since the 2016 vote house prices have risen by a further 7 percent according to ONS data. London has been the hardest-hit property market in the United Kingdom since the Brexit vote with appetite for expensive city centre housing damaged by concern about financial services jobs after Brexit and higher purchase taxes. House prices in London\\'s overvalued market will fall this year and next and will tumble if Britain fails to reach a deal a Reuters poll of analysts and experts predicted in August. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

When it comes to how Brexit will affect business much of the debate in the UK has focused on large firms particularly international ones such as Honda and Nissan. The CBI which mainly represents big business has been tirelessly warning of the economic dangers of a no deal in the coming weeks. The likely impact on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has received much less attention by comparison. We have published a new study in the journal Regional Studies that looks at this in detail. We found that well over one million UK SMEs around a quarter of the total were concerned about how Brexit would affect the success of their business. We also examined how Brexit uncertainty varies according to the size and location of companies and their business orientation. SMEs represent a core part of the UK economy accounting for 99% of all UK firms and 60% of total private sector employment. They are crucial for innovation and productivity growth and have disproportionately driven job creation since 2010. They are also particularly affected by institutional and political uncertainty and less resilient when it comes to unforeseen events such as Brexit. To find out what they thought about Brexit we investigated a large survey of 15867 SMEs that had been compiled by the UK Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy in 2016 and 2017. The 25% who viewed Brexit as a major obstacle to their success – some 1.25m businesses – was a significant increase on the 16% who were of this view immediately after the referendum in 2016. These fears will almost certainly have escalated as the UK moves ever closer to eventual exit from the EU: a recent survey of SMEs by the Cooperative Bank for instance found that Brexit’s effect on the economy was their top concern for 2019 with 30% drawing attention to it. Meanwhile a new survey has found that 57% of Scottish SMEs believe Brexit will be negative for their business compared to only 41% of the managers of bigger companies. Our study found that larger SMEs that were internationally oriented and/or innovators such as tech firms were particularly concerned about Brexit – as were those located in major cities. Worryingly the firms most concerned by Brexit – these innovators and exporters – are the same SMEs deemed most important for generating productivity growth. We found that the single largest factor concerning SMEs was uncertainty regarding future regulatory change with 74% citing it. Smaller businesses were particularly worried as were exporters. Other major concerns included increased import costs (52%) and uncertainty regarding future access to EU markets (59%). Around two-thirds of SMEs had scaled back plans for future capital investment to 2020 while as many as 77% were less focused on increasing export sales over the same period. The study also found that SMEs’ concerns about Brexit were considerably higher in devolved areas like Scotland and Northern Ireland. This is despite the fact that these jurisdictions are best equipped to deal with any negative ramifications through the likes of their enterprise and export agencies and at least in the case of Scotland devolved government. With the uncertainty around Brexit now arguably greater than at any time since the 2016 referendum the findings in our study suggest that SMEs will potentially be the firms hardest hit by Brexit. The UK government has done little or nothing to ease these uncertainties. There are several lessons here that it could learn from Scotland. The Scottish government is offering grants of £4000 to helps SMEs to export for instance. It has also set up a national helpline. In the absence of better support we are seeing the private sector taking steps to support SMEs: Barclays Bank for instance has just announced a new £14 billion lending fund for SMEs to help cope with the uncertainty and has been holding Brexit clinics around the country. Constitutional paralysis or not the UK government needs to recognise that SMEs are the backbone of the economy and crucial for future productivity growth. It must act now to alleviate the anxieties of these businesses so that whatever form of Brexit comes to pass they are as well placed as possible to navigate the choppy waters ahead.

Prime Minister Theresa May on Saturday defended her decision to turn to Britain\\'s main opposition to get her EU divorce deal approved warning without cross-party consensus Brexit could \"slip through our fingers\". The beleaguered leader opened talks this week with the Labour Party in a bid to break months of stubborn opposition in parliament to the withdrawal agreement she struck with European leaders last year. MPs have rejected three times her deal finalised with the bloc last November to end 46 years of membership. May\\'s overtures to Labour came ahead of an EU summit on Wednesday where she must secure another Brexit extension until June 30 to prevent Britain crashing out the bloc at the end of next week with no accord. The country\\'s original March 29 departure date was delayed to April 12 last month. \"We must deliver Brexit and to do so we must agree a deal\" May said in a statement released by Downing Street adding the two main parties agreed on major aspects of Brexit. \"That is the basis for a compromise that can win a majority in parliament and winning that majority is the only way to deliver Brexit. \"The longer this takes the greater the risk of the UK never leaving at all. It would mean letting the Brexit the British people voted for slip through our fingers.\" However after several days of negotiations with Labour its leader Jeremy Corbyn complained he had not \"noticed any great change in the government\\'s position so far\". \"I\\'m waiting to see the red lines move\" he added. Meanwhile EU members who must give unanimous backing to any further Brexit delay are growing increasingly impatient at the dysfunction in Westminster. They could offer just a shorter postponement -- or a longer period of up to a year. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters at a G7 meeting in France on Saturday that it was time for the Brexit crisis to end. \"The British authorities and the British parliament need to understand that (the EU) is not going to be able to constantly exhaust itself with the ups and downs of domestic British politics\" he said. However Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar cautioned it was \"extremely unlikely\" a member would veto another extension while revealing he now favoured a lengthy delay. \\'Restore national identity\\' Despite the continued uncertainty over Brexit it emerged on Saturday that the British government has begun issuing passports with the words \"European Union\" removed from the front cover. The interior ministry said a longstanding decision to start introducing the travel documents without reference to the bloc had gone ahead from March 30. But it confirmed that some newly issued passports will still bear the bloc\\'s name due to an attempt to save public money by using up \"leftover stock\". British passports had already become ensnared in the country\\'s Brexit divisions. The government in 2017 announced that it would return to traditional blue passports \"to restore national identity\" pleasing Brexiteers but drawing scorn from Remainers. The travel documents had dark blue covers from 1921 but Britain switched to burgundy from 1988 in common with other members of the-then European Community. The new production contract is to begin in October 2019 with passports currently being issued in the burgundy colour. \\'Listen to suggestions\\' Whether Britain will have left the bloc by then is uncertain. Even those of May\\'s Conservative colleagues who back her deal have denounced any outreach to Labour while the most hardline Brexiteers remain implacably opposed to her deal. Reports in Britain\\'s Sunday newspapers said Tory MPs would try to oust May if Britain had to contest European Parliament elections in late May as part of a lengthy Brexit delay. But Finance Minister Philip Hammond who backed Remain in Britain\\'s 2016 referendum and is seen as favouring as soft a Brexit as possible urged his divided party to show flexibility. \"We should be open to listen to suggestions that others have made and some people in the Labour Party are making other suggestions\" he said. Labour is pushing for a much closer post-Brexit alliance with the EU including participation in a customs union. May has previously dismissed the idea because it bars Britain from striking its own trade deals with global giants such as China and the United States. But the opposition party is also facing internal division on the issue. Eighty Labour MPs wrote to Jeremy Corbyn on Saturday urging him to secure a guarantee of a second referendum in any Brexit deal he reaches with May. \\xa0 \\'Yellow vests\\' march again as government tries to regroup  EU on fake news alert as continent prepares to vote \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 1st 08:30  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Mr Cameron will be making his case at a Brussels summit that will have on its agenda the UK’s request for a new deal redefining its EU membership. This is likely to overshadow the item on the agenda; migration – which is a very divisive topic. The deal is crucial for Mr Cameron to be able to convince a skeptical British public that the UK will be better off in the EU when they vote in an in-out referendum possibly in four months’ time. But securing the deal is a big ‘if’ and one that hinges on the goodwill of at least four Eastern European countries wary of the UK’s demand to be able to freeze benefits for EU migrants. Technocrats have been working hard behind the scenes to try and reconcile Mr Cameron’s four demands with the concerns of other EU member states. Any suggestion that the summit’s agenda will tackle a Brexit – British exit from the EU – is immediately met by a diplomatic “not exactly”. Malta\\'s European Affairs Minister Louis Grech told the EU General Affairs Council on Tuesday that the EU and the UK would be far stronger together. Member states he said would do their utmost to ensure an equitable and acceptable solution on the UK\\'s proposals for a new settlement to be reached but there had to be a level playing field for all. He said there had to be a fine balancing act between flexibility and rigidity as\\xa0it was becoming increasingly obvious that there was no specific solution that answered all disparate needs and wants. Sources in Brussels have told the Times of Malta the mood is anything but one that favours a UK exit. Leaders will do anything to give Mr Cameron a deal he could work with the sources said even if it means dragging on the talks into the early hours of tomorrow. The summit starts today at 5pm and is supposed to end tomorrow. If no UK deal is reached an emergency summit will be held in a few weeks time. But if Mr Cameron does get the arrangement he hopes for the deal would still require legislative changes that the European Parliament will vote on. This will weaken Mr Cameron’s hand since it means any deal struck today or tomorrow will not be cast in stone. European Parliament president Martin Schulz has said parliament would work constructively but he could not guarantee approval. “This is not possible in a democracy” he said outlining a basic democratic fact. Mr Cameron’s biggest hurdle will be convincing a deeply sceptical British public and members of his own Conservative Party that Britain would be better off inside the EU. With an in-out referendum expected for June – if the deal is reached – many in Europe will be waiting in angst to see what road British voters will take. What reforms is the UK seeking? David Cameron wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK’s membership ahead of a referendum to be held latest by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants. He has four main demands. • Economic governance: The UK wants safeguards that steps to further financial union cannot be imposed on non-eurozone members and the UK will not have to contribute to eurozone bailouts. • Competitiveness: Setting a target for the reduction of excessive regulation and extending the single market. • Immigration: Restricting access to in-work and out-of-work benefits to EU migrants. An option of an “emergency brake” to stop the payments for four years is being discussed as a compromise deal Sovereignty: Allowing Britain to opt out from the EU\\'s founding ambition to forge an \"ever closer union\" of the peoples of Europe so it will not be drawn into further political integration. Giving greater powers to national parliaments to block EU legislation.\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 14th 09:05  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The Prime Minister said the country would take an \"immediate and sustained hit\" if it votes for Brexit in the referendum on June 23. \"I am absolutely convinced that our economic security will be better if we stay in a reformed European Union and it will be seriously at risk if we were to leave\" he told supporters at a Remain campaign event in his Witney constituency in Oxfordshire. \"If we vote to leave on June 23 we will be voting for higher prices we will be voting for fewer jobs we will be voting for lower growth we will be voting potentially for a recession. That is the last thing our economy needs.\" Earlier Mr Cameron highlighted the loss of billions of pounds in infrastructure investment which he said the UK would suffer if its membership of the European Investment Bank (EIB) was cancelled as a result of leaving the EU. If we vote to leave on June 23 we will be voting for higher prices we will be voting for fewer jobs we will be voting for lower growth we will be voting potentially for a recession In a statement issued by No 10 he said the EIB had poured £16 billion into projects in the UK over the past three years helping to finance new trains motorway extensions and research and development facitlities. \"With a smaller economy hit by new trading barriers and job losses it\\'s unlikely we\\'d be able to find that money from alternative sources\" he said. \"A Leave vote risks putting the brakes on the infrastructure investment we need and shifting our economy into reverse.\" His intervention came as Jeremy Corbyn prepared to mount a scathing attack on the Conservatives as he tries to rally support among Labour voters to stay in the EU. As the battle for votes intensifies both the Labour leader and the Prime Minister were out on the campaign trail for Remain - but with sharply differing messages. The Prime Minister was keen to emphasise that the issue of Britain\\'s membership of the EU was \"bigger than party politics\". However in a rally in London Mr Corbyn will launch a highly partisan attack on the Conservatives saying responsibility for many of the country\\'s problems \"lies in 10 Downing Street not in Brussels\". His comments are likely to be seen as a response to concerns within the Remain camp that they are encountering significant hostility to the EU on the doorstep in traditional Labour areas. The Labour leader who for many years opposed EU membership will highlight the importance of European regulations in underpinning workers\\' rights which would be jeopardised by a Leave vote. \"People in this country face many problems: from insecure jobs low pay and unaffordable housing to stagnating living standards and environmental degradation and the responsibility for them lies in 10 Downing Street not in Brussels\" he will say. \"The Tories and Ukip are on record as saying they would like to cut back our workplace rights and many unscrupulous employers would have our rights at work off us if they had the chance. \"Instead a Labour government will go further and work to raise employment standards throughout Europe to stop the undercutting of wages and strengthen every worker in Europe.\" The official Britain Stronger In Europe campaign said that it is staging 1000 pro-Remain events across the UK with Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron and the Greens\\' Caroline Lucas among those taking to the streets. On the Leave side Boris Johnson will be speaking in the South West while the Grassroots Out campaign is mounting a nationwide blitz with events across the country. They include a rally in Chester addressed by Conservative former cabinet minister Owen Paterson and Ukip migration spokesman Steven Woolfe. Mr Paterson will say: \"If we vote to remain we will be consigning ourselves to being a colony of an EU Superstate with more integration and increasingly diminished British influence. \"If we vote Leave we will be making the safer choice and securing the future freedom and prosperity of this region and the UK at large. Mr Woolfe will say: \"This referendum is not about whether you are on the right of politics or on the left whether you are Tory Labour Ukip or support no party at all. \"This referendum is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to take back control of our country. Unlike a general election every vote matters.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The European Commission is rolling out the red carpet for Scotland\\'s first minister hours after outgoing British Prime Minister David Cameron told an EU summit his country would be leaving the European Union following last week\\'s referendum. A spokeswoman for the EU executive said Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker would meet First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in the late afternoon after Britain\\'s 27 partners meet without the UK to discuss how to respond to a Brexit. They are expected to launch a period of reflection culminating in a set of EU reform proposals to be unveiled by March of next year the 60th anniversary of the founding Rome Treaty. Leaders have said the focus will be on getting a grip on migration bolstering security and creating jobs and growth. \"It\\'s important to have this meeting of 27 because it will show the unity of the 27\" said Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel describing the British vote as a wake-up call for Europe. Sturgeon has said Scotland where more than 60 percent of voters said they wanted to stay in the EU does not want to be forced out of Europe by England the most populous component of the United Kingdom which voted to leave. She has raised the prospect of the Scottish parliament trying to block exit legislation and alternatively holding a new referendum on independence. The Scottish Nationalist premier was to meet European Parliament president Martin Schulz first in Brussels to discuss the way forward. But the president of the European Council Donald Tusk who chairs EU summits turned down her request for a meeting his spokesman said. Diplomats said there was a risk that the high-profile welcome for Sturgeon a day after Cameron\\'s last EU summit could be seen in London as an encouragement to secession although EU officials denied any such intention. Cameron told European Union leaders yesterday that Britain\\'s future relations with the bloc could hinge on the EU\\'s willingness to rethink free movement of workers which he blamed for the referendum \"no\". Juncker rebuffed that explanation for the vote saying that successive British leaders had pa]rticipated in \"Brussels bashing\" and should not be surprised if their citizens believed them. German Chancellor Angela Merkel doused any hopes that Britain might yet reverse its decision warning against \"wishful thinking\". While she persuaded fellow leaders to give London more time to hand in its formal notice to quit Merkel said Britain could not drag out the process endlessly and made clear that a new governnment would not be allowed to \"cherry-pick\" the parts of EU membership benefits that it liked. \"Some think that Britain needs more time. I hear this yes but I think it strange. It\\'s a type of surrealism\" said Belgium\\'s Michel. Cameron who announced his intention to resign after losing the referendum partly due to concerns about immigration told his last summit he hoped his country would maintain as tight an economic and political relationship as possible with the EU. \"Britain will be leaving the European Union but we will not be turning our back on Europe\" he told a late night news conference after a dinner at which he said many European partners voiced regret and friendship for Britain. EU officials and diplomats said the mood was coolly polite. The Conservative leader said he had reported with sadness on the outcome of the referendum saying: \"People recognised the economic case for staying but there was a very great concern about movement of people and that was coupled with concern about issues of sovereignty. I think we need to think about that Europe needs to think about that.\" In a veiled rebuke to Leave campaign leaders such as Boris Johnson who is vying to succeed him Cameron said Britons would have to understand they could not keep all the benefits of EU membership without the costs. \"If you want the full benefits of the single market you\\'ll have to be part of every part of it\" he said. Driving home that message French President Francois Hollande said continued access to the EU\\'s prized single market was dependent on accepting the so-called four freedoms of movement of goods capital workers and services. \"If they don\\'t want free movement they won\\'t have access to the single market\" he said adding that the City of London would no longer be able to act as a clearing house in euros. The European Parliament adopted a non-binding resolution on Tuesday demanding that London activate the EU treaty\\'s voluntary exit clause as fast as possible. That would launch negotiations on withdrawal terms with a two-year countdown to departure. \"Waiting for several months as has been announced by you Prime Minister Cameron and taking the destiny of our entire continent hostage purely for internal party political reasons would be totally unacceptable\" European Parliament President Martin Schulz told the British leader in the summit. \"That would not mean stability - on the contrary it would mean prolonged uncertainty\" the German Social Democrat said summing up the fears of many EU partners. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Update 10.10am  UK financial markets braced for one of their most volatile days ever today with sterling hitting a 31-year low in its biggest fall in history after Britons voted to leave the EU and David Cameron said he would resign as prime minister. Government bond yields pointed to a new record low and UK and European stocks opened 8 percent lower reflecting widespread alarm in the financial community over the uncertainty and volatility likely to be unleashed by the Brexit vote. The pound had hit a 2016 high above $1.50 shortly after an earlier opinion poll showed an outcome in favour of \\'Remain\\' but fell nearly 17 cents from that peak as it became clear that the \\'Leave\\' camp had won the landmark referendum. The British currency\\'s fall of almost 10 per cent was historic marking a decline greater than anything seen since free-floating system of exchange rates was introduced in the early 1970s. It was even bigger than on \\'Black Wednesday\\' in 1992 when billionaire financier George Soros was instrumental in pushing the pound out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. London bankers working through the night said they hadn\\'t seen anything like the volatility sweeping across UK assets. \"The word \\'unprecedented\\' is often used too much and people often reach for the hyperbole. But this is truly unprecedented\" said Steven Major head of global rates strategy at HSBC in London. HSBC cut its forecast for the pound to $1.20 by the end of this year and several other banks said they expect the value of the British currency to fall further too. Sterling fell as low as $1.3305 its weakest level against the dollar since September 1985 before recovering some ground to $1.3750. It fell as much as 6 percent against the euro and 15 percent against the yen. The cost of insuring against swings in the sterling/dollar exchange rate jumped to 53.375 percent the highest since at least 1998 before easing back. Banks are likely to be in the spotlight after the Hong Kong listings of HSBC and Standard Chartered plunged as much as 10 percent in Asian hours. Shares in UK banks Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland were down 30 percent. Bond trading platform Tradeweb opened earlier than usual on Friday and initial data showed a jump in benchmark 10-year UK government bond yields to 1.57 percent from around 1.38 percent late Thursday. But that soon reversed with Citi and Goldman Sachs among those predicting a fall below 1 percent. The biggest swings however were in the foreign exchange market where trading went on through the night - albeit in light volumes for much of that time - and sterling tumbled to its lowest against the dollar since September 1985. \"I\\'m one of the people who was here the last time we were trading at $1.35. It\\'s back to the future we\\'re back to where we were in 1985\" said Nick Parsons co-head of global currency strategy at NAB. \"We\\'ve had a 10 percent decline in six hours. That\\'s simply extraordinary. And a vote to leave provides an existential crisis for Europe\" he said. The referendum\\'s market impact was global. U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply as investors rushed to the safety of U.S. government debt while other safe-haven assets like the Japanese yen jumped and gold had its biggest rally since the 2008 crisis. All the major international and British banks in London including Citi <C.N> Deutsche Bank JPMorgan Goldman Sachs and Barclays had traders either working through the night or on call. On Citi\\'s foreign exchange desk in London dealers were only accepting voice orders and only desk heads had the authority to approve trades according to a source at the bank. Banks had warned clients about volatile trading conditions around the results which may lead to large gaps in prices. Barclays stopped accepting new \"stop loss\" orders as of 0600 GMT an extremely rare move for one of the big six banks that dominate the world\\'s biggest financial market. Investors are now bracing themselves for possible intervention from central banks or finance ministries to restore stability and confidence in markets. So far there has been nothing concrete market sources said. \"I\\'m expecting central bank action and the Bank of England will probably come in with liquidity provisions. A rate cut will likely come at some point too - not today that will be panic\" said HSBC\\'s Major. The BoE said in a statement it is \"monitoring developments closely\" having undertaken \"extensive contingency planning and is working closely with Her Majesty\\'s Treasury other domestic authorities and overseas central banks.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A shock referendum result demanding controls on European Union migration has created a serious headache for politicians who must do the people’s bidding without jeopardising access to the single market. Home to more than a million EU citizens Switzerland voted on February 9 2014 to impose quotas on migration potentially ripping up a bilateral deal with the EU on free movement of people. It could trigger a ‘guillotine clause’ cancelling six other bilateral agreements including on air transport road rail and agriculture. The government sees few ways out and in what could be a warning to Britain may have no choice but to ask voters to reconsider. Though even that is difficult. Switzerland is one of the models some supporters of Britain leaving the European Union have pointed to of a European economy that thrives outside of the EU. But in 1999 to negotiate access to the European single market it had to agree to bilateral deals that allow free movement of workers from EU countries. European leaders say they will demand similar free movement conditions if Britain is to retain easy access to the EU market a position that British officials acknowledge makes it difficult to deliver the limits on migration that voters want while also keeping the free trade businesses need. As in Britain voters defied the advice of their government to deliver a narrow victory to a referendum campaign led by right-wing populists. The Swiss referendum was backed in rural areas with few migrants and carried with 50.3 per cent of the vote upsetting businesses and creating an unexpected dilemma for the government. Swtizerland now has until February to implement the binding result. “Right now we are in a situation that is both delicate and paradoxical” Swiss negotiator Jacques de Watteville told an audience of Swiss bankers earlier this month before the Brexit vote. Foreigners make up a quarter of the population of the neutral Alpine country which despite being outside the EU is inside its Schengen zone of border-free travel. Three hundred thousand workers commute into Switzerland across borders from France Germany and Italy every day. Swiss politicians now appear to face a choice of passing legislation that the EU will reject abrogating their agreements with the EU unilaterally or hoping that the 2014 vote will get overturned by a new referendum. “I don’t see any possibility for the EU to give anything to Switzerland” said René Schwok a professor at the University of Geneva and author of books on Swiss-EU relations. The referendum has already resulted in Switzerland being dumped from Europe’s ‘Erasmus’ university exchange programme. Once the government passes legislation to implement it the guillotine clause would end a range of other bilateral agreements having far wider impact. A campaign to overturn the 2014 referendum is already underway but it would require a majority of Switzerland’s 26 cantons to agree as well as the population which means it is unlikely to succeed Schwok said. Some in Britain are closely watching the Swiss case for the lessons they can learn. Remain campaigners say it shows that the victorious Leave side may not be able to deliver its promises. “It’s not at all clear that Switzerland is going to achieve the objectives that it has set out” said British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond who campaigned to remain in the EU against a Leave campaign also led by figures from his ruling Conservative Party. “There are some of my colleagues in the Conservative party at the moment saying things like ‘It’ll be straightforward to agree access to the single market and there’ll be no need to have freedom of movement” he told BBC radio this week. “I’m afraid they are simply betraying a lack of understanding of the political realities in the European Union. It will be much more complicated than that.” De Watteville the Swiss diplomat charged with finding a solution to the EU problem said whatever solution is found the Swiss will probably have to return to the ballot box. “In the end it’s going to be up to the Swiss people to decide because in any scenario it’s very likely that a referendum will be announced by one side or the other” he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

US president Barack Obama\\'s blunt warning that Britain would be at \"the back of the queue\" for American trade deals if it quit the EU has provoked a backlash from the Brexit camp. Leading Leave campaigners accused Mr Obama of spouting Britain-bashing rhetoric at Downing Street\\'s bidding in order to scare voters into the Remain camp. The attack came after Mr Obama set out in stark terms that Britain would not be able to strike a free trade deal with the US \"any time soon\" if it leaves the EU because Washington\\'s focus would be on reaching agreement with Brussels. The president was speaking after Downing Street talks with Prime Minister David Cameron during a two-day visit which he has used to speak out in favour of continued UK membership of the 28-nation bloc after the June 23 referendum. We heard you are our best friend we have a special relationship and you will get a punishment beating if you leave the EU Ukip leader Nigel Farage said Mr Obama did not know what he was talking about and was being manipulated by Number 10. \"He said Britain would be at the back of the queue no American would ever say \\'back of the queue\\' Americans don\\'t use the word \\'queue\\' Americans use the word \\'line\\'\" Mr Farage told BBC Radio Four\\'s Any Questions. \"Therefore what Obama said when he said we would be at the back of the queue he was doing the bidding of Cameron and Number 10 and doing his best to talk down Britain and I think that\\'s shameful.\" Tory former defence secretary Liam Fox insisted that Mr Obama\\'s views would be irrelevant after the looming US presidential election. \"We have a referendum at the end of June presidential elections are in November so whoever it is that will be at the helm of the United States won\\'t be Barack Obama. So to an extent whatever he says today is largely irrelevant\" he said. \"It will be the next president and the next congress who will be in charge of any trade arrangements. \"Why do we get trade arrangements? We get them because it is to the mutual benefit of both parties and we have a roughly balanced trade with the United States. It would seem bizarre if we weren\\'t able to take advantage of a trade relationship. \"We heard \\'you are our best friend we have a special relationship and you will get a punishment beating if you leave the EU\\'. This is very much the Downing St refrain\" Dr Fox told BBC2\\'s Newsnight. London mayor and prominent Leave campaigner Boris Johnson described the American stance as \"bizarre\". At a joint press conference with Mr Cameron the president stressed that the referendum was a \"decision for the people of the United Kingdom\" and he was \"not coming here to fix any votes\". But he defended his right to offer an opinion saying: \"In democracies everybody should want more information not less and you shouldn\\'t be afraid to hear an argument being made - that\\'s not a threat that should enhance the debate. \"Particularly because my understanding is that some of the folks on the other side have been ascribing to the United States certain actions we will take if the UK does leave the EU - they say for example that \\'we will just cut our own trade deals with the United States\\'. \"So they are voicing an opinion about what the United States is going to do I figured you might want to hear from the president of the United States what I think the United States is going to do. \"And on that matter for example I think it\\'s fair to say that maybe some point down the line there might be a UK-US trade agreement but it\\'s not going to happen any time soon because our focus is in negotiating with a big bloc the European Union to get a trade agreement done. \"The UK is going to be in the back of the queue.\" Mr Obama said that while the vote was a matter for the British people the US had a \"deep interest\" in the outcome. \"The United States wants a strong United Kingdom as a partner and the United Kingdom is at its best when it is helping to lead a strong Europe\" he said. \"It leverages UK power to be part of the European Union. I don\\'t believe the EU moderates British influence in the world it magnifies it. I believe the UK strengthens both our collective security and prosperity through the EU.\" Mr Cameron said the referendum was the \"sovereign choice of the British people\" but added: \"As we make that choice it surely makes sense to listen to what our friends think to listen to their opinion to listen to their views and that\\'s what Barack has been talking about today.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Despite the humiliating rejection of Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal Britain is no closer to knowing the end result of its vote to leave the EU. A raft of amendments to be voted on by MPs today threaten to further muddy the waters as the clock ticks down to Britain’s scheduled departure from the EU on March 29. Photo: AFP  The infrastructure at the airport arrivals lounge is the most worrying aspect of Brexit for the director general of the Customs Department with most of the other bases already well covered. The department has been slowly but surely building up its resources over the past few years with the priority being the creation of an IT system that could handle the extra workload at the ports. But with 12 flights arriving and 12 leaving every day from the UK on average – each with 160 people on board – that will put considerable pressure on the red and green Customs gates as they will no longer be entitled to use the blue channel and will have to indicate whether they have anything to declare. “And that is the average over the whole year. There are periods in summer when there might be three times that amount!” director-general Joseph Chetcuti said. The Budget allocation was always based on a workforce of 400 Negotiations are already underway with Malta International Airport on ways to avoid the fear of queues that are giving Mr Chetcuti headaches.\\xa0 “This is a commercial entity which has to consider every centimetre to generate revenue” he admitted.\\xa0 “But I envisage that we would need another red and another green channel.” There are other aspects to do with the shift of all the passengers onto a ‘third country’ status – including the huge amount of additional VAT refund applications this will entail currently mostly received from Maltese emigrants living in Australia Russians and Japanese Africans and Swiss. A new luggage scanner van is also being purchased with European Union funding which will be in place by around September screening bags before they are even put onto the conveyor belts – which will take pressure off the red and green Customs gates. “But we would still need to be vigilant for hand luggage and things concealed in people’s clothing. In fact we are considering introducing a full body scanner in the future which would check for arms narcotics and cash” he said. Mr Chetcuti took over the department three years ago after having worked his way up the ranks for three decades. When he took over there were 200 operational staff. This has now gone up to nearly 400 with a 25 per cent increase at the airport which will be boosted by a further 15 per cent in the coming weeks and a 10 per cent increase at the cargo ports which may not be enough. The increase may pale into in-significance compared to the 900 officers added in France and 700 in the Netherlands but it is none-theless a considerable leap. “The Budget allocation was always based on a workforce of 400 but until now half of that money was returned. Now we will be using it all” he said noting that the department had not recruited significantly for 25 years. With British MPs scheduled to vote tonight on amendments to Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan the department has had to operate on the assumption that there will be no deal.\\xa0  One thing that many overlook he said was that even if the eventual deal is for the UK to join a Customs union the department will have to deal with all the additional declaration documentation data management and processing that a third country consignment would entail – but without the revenue that would come in from import tariffs. “If there is no deal we get the extra work but at least we get extra revenue. If there is a deal we will get the extra work but with no revenue.\\xa0 “As we say in Maltese we get the bone but with no meat on it” he said pointing out that Malta only retains 20 per cent of the revenue as the rest goes to the European Commission. Passengers are just one aspect. The department also handles 25 groupage trailers a week from the UK – each of which would have some 10 consignees. When all the consignments come from within the EU – including those that arrive via Italy – then the trailers would be released.\\xa0 Now if even one of them is from the UK they will need to be processed at Ħal-Far. There are also 30 full loads a week via the sea ports not to mention the 100 that come by airfreight and 5500 consignments a week that come by express mail and the as-yet unquantified amount that come via parcel post (although the majority are worth under €22 and would not fall under Customs scrutiny). “We would have to handle some 6000 to 7000 declarations a week more” Mr Chetcuti said.\\xa0 At the moment although everything is in limbo high-level meetings will be held in Brussels next week and the Customs Department is ready to roll out roadshows for the business community explaining things as they stand. “Fortunately some 90 per cent of the business community already deals with third countries so they know what this entails. For the rest we are organising training” he said. “We are as ready as we can be in the circumstances. My only concern is that there might be queues at the airport as that would be a major inconvenience for tourists.

Britain might continue to pay billions of pounds into the European Union\\'s budget after Brexit to maintain single-market access for the City of London and other sectors under plans being discussed by government the Financial Times reported. Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s recent rhetoric has perturbed some investors who fear Britain could give up trying to remain in the EU\\'s single market in order to impose controls on immigration from the other 27 EU member states. But the Financial Times said on Monday May had not ruled out making future payments to the EU to secure privileged access to the single market. Finance is among the sectors most likely to benefit in any deal that recognised the \"equivalence\" of regulatory regimes the FT said. The FT said that May assured Japanese carmaker Nissan that trading conditions for its British car plant would not change after Brexit the first suggestion that the government could pick certain sectors to shield from the impact of leaving the EU. Continued payments into the EU after Brexit has long been seen by Eurosceptics as a possible way to keep some preferential access to EU markets while pulling more sovereignty back to London over areas such as migration. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A \"hard\" Brexit in which Britain loses its free access to the European Union market now looks like the most likely outcome of the country\\'s plan to leave the bloc ratings agency Standard & Poor\\'s said. Britain will suffer the brunt of the economic impact of Brexit and the effects on the world economy will be more limited S&P said in its latest update on Britain\\'s economy. S&P cut Britain\\'s top-notch AAA credit rating by two places to AA shortly after the June 23 vote to leave the EU arguing that the country\\'s capacity for effective and stable policymaking had diminished. On Friday it said that it appeared that Britain\\'s government had not yet accepted that the EU was unlikely to yield on the indivisibility of its four freedoms - the free movement of people capital goods and services. \"Even if Westminster were to acknowledge the EU position it is hard to fathom how a rather hard Brexit can be avoided unless both sides become much more flexible than they appear today\" said S&P chief sovereign credit officer Moritz Kraemer. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May is seeking a deal with a Northern Irish Protestant party to save her premiership today as she comes under intense pressure to soften her approach to Brexit days before formal EU divorce talks. May\\'s botched election gamble which saw her lose her parliamentary majority left her so weakened that supporters of closer ties with the European Union publicly demanded she take a more consensual and business friendly approach to Brexit. In an attempt to avoid a second election that could deepen the worst political turmoil in Britain since last June\\'s shock vote to leave the European Union May apologised to her Conservative Party\\'s lawmakers who said they would leave her in power - for now. \"She said: \\'I\\'m the person who got us into this mess and I\\'m the one who is going to get us out of it\\'\" said one Conservative lawmaker who attended yesterday\\'s meeting. \"She said she will serve us as long as we want her.\" To stay in government May must strike a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) a small eurosceptic Northern Irish party with 10 parliamentary seats. DUP leader Arlene Foster arrived for talks with May. She waved but did not say anything as she went into Downing Street. She looked at her watch and ignored a question from a reporter who asked: \"What is your price?\" \"The deal will be done\" said Jon Tonge professor of politics at Liverpool University. \"Basically it will be Theresa May signing cheques for the foreseeable future or a monthly direct debit as it were into Northern Ireland\\'s coffers.\" \"The DUP may never have the political arithmetic so favourable again so like the Conservatives the DUP will want to avoid another election and will want to keep drinking in the political free bar that is available to it\" Tonge said. But a deal with the DUP would risk destabilising the political balance in Northern Ireland by increasing the influence of pro-British unionists who have struggled for years with Irish Catholic nationalists who want Northern Ireland to join a united Ireland. While the DUP are deeply eurosceptic they have balked at some of the practical implications of a so-call hard Brexit - including a potential loss of a \"frictionless border\" with the Republic of Ireland - and talks will touch on efforts to minimise the potential damage to Northern Ireland. Macron meeting later today With formal EU divorce talks due next week May heads to France later today to meet Emmanuel Macron who last month swept to victory in the presidential election. During the campaign May cast herself as the only leader competent enough to navigate the tortuous Brexit negotiations that will shape the future of the United Kingdom and its $2.5 trillion economy. Jeremy Corbyn leader of the opposition Labour Party which saw its number of parliamentary seats and share of the vote increase said there could be another election this year or early in 2018 after Thursday\\'s vote produced no clear winner. May who ahead of the June referendum supported remaining in the EU has promised to start the formal Brexit talks next week but opponents of a sharp break with the EU took her woes as a chance to push back against her strategy. Before the election May proposed a clean break from the EU involving withdrawal from Europe\\'s single market limits on immigration and a bespoke customs deal with the EU. Brexit minister David Davis has insisted the approach to the EU divorce had not changed but at the meeting with lawmakers yesterday May recognised that a broader consensus needed to be built for Brexit and made clear she would listen to all wings of the party on the issue. Consensus for Brexit Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the government should put economic growth at the heart of its Brexit strategy while some senior ministers have pushed for less focus on immigration and more on jobs. The Daily Telegraph reported cabinet ministers have opened back-channel talks to senior Labour lawmakers to secure a cross-party agreement on Brexit. When asked about the Daily Telegraph article Michael Gove a minister who campaigned for Brexit told ITV: \"This is news to me.\" William Hague a former leader of the Conservative Party called for business groups and lawmakers from all parties to be brought in to agree a national position on Brexit. May\\'s weakness means she must now listen to all shades of opinion on Brexit as she goes into Britain\\'s most complex negotiations since World War Two. But May faces a difficult balancing act: Divisions over Europe helped sink the premierships of Margaret Thatcher John Major and David Cameron and many of her lawmakers and party membership support a sharp break with the EU. \"The Tory civil war on the EU which has ripped it apart since the Maastricht rebellions of the early 1990s and which the referendum was supposed to solve is now raging again\" said Chris Grey an academic who specialises in Brexit at Royal Holloway in London. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Under that timetable members of Parliament would vote on whether to accept or reject the divorce treaty by the beginning of December sources told Bloomberg. May appealed to her Conservative Party on Wednesday to unite behind her plan to leave the European Union warning critics their arguments could put Brexit in jeopardy. With just six months before Britain is due to exit the EU she has so far weathered the Brexit storm shrugging off a barnstorming speech by her ex-foreign minister Boris Johnson that did little to hide his leadership ambitions. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

He repeated that he believed leaders would extend Britain\\'s status-quo transition period after Brexit in March if London asked for that - an issue May raised at the summit. \"It was made clear by the UK that more time is needed to find a precise solution\" Tusk said. \"Therefore there is no other way but to continue the talks.

Updated 3.45pm British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday that further assurances on her Brexit deal were possible after European Union leaders told her they would not be renegotiating the agreement and scorned her stilted defence of Britain\\'s departure. With the British parliament deadlocked the ultimate end of the Brexit project remains unclear with possible outcomes ranging from a disorderly departure with no deal to another referendum on European Union membership. May who on Wednesday survived a plot in her party to oust her asked EU leaders at a summit in Brussels for political and legal assurances to help her convince the British parliament to approve her deal. \"Further clarification and discussion following the Council\\'s conclusions is in fact possible\" May told reporters. \"There is work still to do and we will be holding talks in coming days about how to obtain the further assurances.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron ruled out reopening last month\\'s agreement aimed at ensuring a smooth exit on March 29 though leaders assured her that it should not bind Britain to EU rules forever. After EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker said talks with the British over Brexit often led to \"nebulous\" debates May was shown on official footage remonstrating with him. What they said was not audible but May appeared agitated while Juncker held her by the arm shook his head and raised his palm in an apparent effort to calm her before the Dutch prime minister arrived to interrupt them. Asked if they had spoken about the \"nebulous\" remark May said: \"I had a robust discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker.\" The exchanges had echoes of a summit in Salzburg in September where EU leaders had been expected to demonstratively offer support for May. Instead they were irritated by Britain\\'s tactics in the run-up to the meeting and the event ended in acrimony. \\'Brexit means Brexit\\' Diplomats said May had exasperated EU leaders on Thursday by failing to outline precise proposals for what she needed to push the deal through and even at one point used her much-derided mantra of \"Brexit means Brexit\". \"If this is all she has for us there is no point trying too hard now\" one diplomat told Reuters. \"She still needs to do her homework - maybe she\\'ll come back in January with something concrete and then we will see.\" \"To say \\'Brexit means Brexit\\' more than two years after it all started was what toughened the other leaders\\' stance\" said the diplomat. May\\'s allies at home said the summit was a useful start but the opposition Labour Party said May had failed and called for the parliamentary vote on the deal that she postponed on Monday fearing a heavy defeat to be held next week. Arlene Foster the leader of the Northern Irish party that props up May\\'s minority government urged May to stand up to the EU and win legally binding changes to the deal. On the currency market sterling dropped almost one percent to $1.2539 and looked set for its biggest drop in seven weeks. \\'Trust me\\' After a punishing week May was asked by a reporter for Britain\\'s generally pro-Conservative Daily Mail which was worse - the malcontents at home or the \\'Euro bullies\\' in Brussels - and whether she ever wanted to ditch her job and fly off to a remote island. \"Negotiations like this are always tough\" May said. \"There are always difficult times and as you get close to the very end then that can get even more difficult because you\\'re absolutely sorting out the last details of something.\" May had asked for political and legal assurances that the so-called Northern Irish backstop would be temporary and urged the leaders to look at her track record of delivering results even when the odds looked stacked against her. The backstop is an insurance clause obliging Britain to follow EU trade regulations until a better way is found to avoid a \"hard border\" between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. May told EU leaders she believed there was \"a majority in parliament who want to follow through on the referendum and leave with a negotiated deal\" but cautioned that an accidental \"no deal\" departure was possible. Diplomats said May indicated she would want to come back for a second bite of \"assurances\" with \"legal force\" and some said they would be willing to listen and try to accommodate her. But the EU also said it was prepared for Britain to exit with no deal which would also mean no measures to smooth the transition. \"The signals we heard yesterday were not very reassuring about the capabilities of the UK to honour the arrangement that was concluded\" said Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel \"so we are going to be sure to prepare for all the scenarios including a \\'no-deal\\'.\" Malta well prepared In the meantime the Prime Minister\\'s office in Malta confirmed that Cabinet was briefed about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on Tuesday and had been reassured that the various sectors affected were well prepared in particular the Customs Department. The Budget had also envisaged aid for companies whose main business was with the UK. The government appealed to all those concerned to make sure that they made contingency plans for a worst-case scenario reassuring that the government would not interfere in the private sector. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Financial markets have not \"priced in\" the risk of a no-deal Brexit and could suffer turmoil if the \"worst-case scenario\" materialises top European central bankers warned Monday. The risk of Britain crashing out of the EU on April 12 is \"something that we cannot neglect\" European Central Bank vice-president Luis de Guindos told European Parliament lawmakers in Brussels. \"Markets have not priced in the possibility of a no-deal scenario... just suppose that this worst-case scenario arrives we have to be prepared\" he added. European institutions and national governments \"have taken actions... to minimise the potential impact\" while \"the private sector is more prepared... than it was only six months ago\" de Guindos said. But with the eurozone economy slowing late last year and into the start of 2019 a disorderly Brexit \"could be a sort of amplifier of the negative impacts and the downward trends\" by undermining confidence still further he said. \"Markets sometimes overshoot\" in reacting to political events de Guindos noted. The former Spanish economy minister\\'s warning followed up a similar statement from Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot. \"Markets haven\\'t priced in a hard Brexit\" he told German business daily Handelsblatt. \"There could be significant repricing on markets and the pound would come under pressure\" if it comes to pass.

Read the original article. In her statement to the House of Commons the UK prime minister has failed to offer any real clarity on where her government’s Brexit policy is heading. Rather than unveiling a Plan B she set out Plan May with some procedural bells and whistles. Number 10 followed her statement by saying there will not be another meaningful vote on Brexit until February. Significantly the prime minister has refused to take a no-deal Brexit off the agenda. Following parliament’s decisive vote not to approve the texts of the withdrawal agreement and political declaration negotiated between the UK and the EU back in November a no-deal Brexit is now the default position unless something else changes. Three things could change. First with the March 29 deadline looming without a Brexit deal parliament could decide to shift the goalposts by requiring the government to seek an extension of the Article 50 negotiation period. This procedural device was originally proposed in a private member’s bill promoted by Conservative MP Nick Boles but it is likely to be superseded by an alternative proposal from Labour MP Yvette Cooper in which a refusal by parliament to approve the texts agreed between the UK and the EU would lead to a request to extend the negotiation period.\\xa0Any failure by parliament to approve a deal would mean that parliament instructed government to bring the withdrawal process to an end In terms of Article 50 the UK can make such a request but it still needs the unanimous consent of the EU27. Assuming that consent were given it would simply delay a no-deal Brexit. Something would have to happen during this extension to change the parliamentary arithmetic to produce a majority to back a deal. The most obvious way of doing that would be if a general election were held forcing the political parties to lay out their visions of the UK’s future relationship with the EU. Former Conservative leader William Hague has been talking up the possibility of an early election. The risk however would be that a divided nation produced a hung parliament with no better consensus on what is in the national interest. A different possibility would be to make revocation of the Article 50 withdrawal notification the new default. This wouldn’t just take a no-deal Brexit off the table. Any failure by parliament to approve a deal would mean that parliament instructed government to bring the withdrawal process to an end. Following a ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union in December this is a real alternative. The problem is that this goes further than changing the default on Brexit; it reverses Brexit itself. It is hard to see how this could occur without another referendum. And as the prime minister made clear in her statement she believes that no majority exists in the House of Commons for another referendum.\\xa0The problem is that this goes further than changing the default on Brexit; it reverses Brexit itself But even if a referendum were to take place following parliament’s failure to approve a deal the referendum would be a straight choice between remaining in the EU and a no-deal Brexit. So even on this scenario a no-deal Brexit could still occur. The third option is to focus on substance. Here the prime minister identified the Irish backstop the future relationship and protecting social environmental and citizens rights as areas where action might need to be taken. Leaving aside the issues of rights where the UK is in a position to take unilateral action any “Plan B” would need to address the Irish Protocol contained in the withdrawal agreement and the future relationship set out in the political declaration. Changes to the Irish backstop means opening up a legal text which the EU has said it will not do. Almost all the negotiation time in 2018 was spent trying to resolve this issue. But even in terms of the hard numbers flipping the votes of the DUP and Brexiteers who objected to the backstop is unlikely to give the prime minister the majority she would need. She would still need a wider coalition to either accept the deal or at least abstain rather than voting against it. That’s why attention still needs to be paid to the future relationship. What the prime minister has offered however is simply to involve parliament and voices outside of parliament more closely in shaping the UK’s position on the future relationship with the EU with the important caveat that it is “government’s responsibility to negotiate” with the EU. In short while parliament and the devolved administrations may expect to be better engaged the government does not intend to hand control of Brexit over to MPs. It still appears to be Plan May.

The Brexit deal sealed by British PM Theresa May and the EU is the \"best and only solution\" for an orderly withdrawal German foreign minister Heiko Maas said Wednesday stressing the bloc won\\'t leave Ireland isolated. \"Our position is clear: the withdrawal agreement is the best and only solution for an orderly exit\" he told the Funke media group after British MPs voted for May to renegotiate the deal. MPs late Tuesday voted through an amendment saying they would only support a divorce deal if its controversial \"backstop\" clause to keep the Irish border open was removed. Read: May seeks to revise Brexit deal but EU rules out changes Maas said it remained unclear what the British government wants amended. \"It must now quickly say what it wants because time is short\" said Maas. He stressed however that Germany and the EU stood firmly behind Ireland on the issue. \"We won\\'t allow Ireland to be isolated on this question\" he said. Brexit hardliners from May\\'s Conservative party think the backstop - created to keep the border open with Ireland - could see Britain indefinitely tied to EU trade rules. The winning amendment calls for the backstop to be replaced with \"alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border\" - vague wording that did not pin May to any specific approach. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The City of London has not been as vocal as other industry sectors during the Brexit negotiations but it is perceived to be dissatisfied. The UK’s future relationship with the EU remains unclear – and if there’s one thing most businesses do not like it’s uncertainty. This is why the City broadly approves of Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement. At the very least it stops Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal on March 29. But with UK politicians not signing off on this agreement uncertainty persists. And as Brexit’s 11th hour creeps closer we are able to see just how different financial firms are dealing with the UK’s impending departure from the EU. Arguments as to the effects of Brexit on the City range from the catastrophic to the negligible. Reams of data and statistics have been produced to illustrate these extreme positions and multiple standpoints in between. The effect has – predictably – been confusion. Is the City really threatened by Brexit or not? Perhaps unsurprisingly attitudes vary from firm to firm and the answer can be found by untangling the different aspects of City business. Firms dealing with managing the investments of wealthy international clients and funds are less affected by a regulatory rupture between the UK and the EU. Yes there may be some costs involved in moving funds around to meet regulatory requirements as they evolve but there are also opportunities. Regulatory and tax arbitrage – where firms capitalise on legal loopholes and inconsistent requirements in different countries – is how much of the City makes its money. So a new subdivision of systems and requirements within Europe would open up opportunities for savings and new products. The significant amounts of money involved in this aspect of the City’s business ensure that a great deal of the current financial structure will remain in place no matter what shape Brexit eventually takes. Other aspects of the City’s business are more vulnerable. Losing the “passporting” rights that allow banks to ply their services across the EU means that those parts of the City engaged in insurance commercial and retail banking will no longer be able to service their European clients. As much was admitted in the government’s no-deal preparation notices. And even if a Brexit deal is signed off before March 29 the loss will occur after the end of the transition period. Subsequently for the part of the City’s banking and insurance sectors that deal with what we call the real economy (standard retail clients and businesses) their business model is up in the air. The only safe solution is to relocate to an EU member state or wind down contracts they will not be able to service in the future. This explains the uneven movement of City firms in response to Brexit. Some move funds and some of their people by establishing or augmenting a base in Europe. For example Barclay’s bank recently obtained court approval to move a massive €190 billion fund to Ireland. But this movement isn’t just in one direction – those firms that used to serve British clients from an EU location are now relocating to London. Citibank for example is setting up a new British bank that will be headquartered in London to ensure it can service its retail clients in the UK after Brexit. Previously this business was covered by its Citibank Europe headquarters in Dublin. Of course the money involved reflects the relative strength and volume of the client base. This is why the movement away from the City makes headlines while the opposite is primarily of interest to clients affected. For other firms changes brought about by Brexit are so fundamental that they no longer need to maintain a UK presence. Those will move their regulated operations or relocate the entirety of their funds with Frankfurt Paris and Dublin being the main beneficiaries in the field of financial services.   Read more: Ireland is in prime position to profit from Brexit relocations   A less-reported consequence of all this movement is that City firms might also be examining their legal options in terms of suing the British government for the losses incurred by relocations or loss of market access. So far only a few have the jurisdiction to sue – investors from countries that have signed some form of treaty with the UK that includes investor-state dispute settlement clauses. These will be primarily firms from outside Europe that had settled in the City in order to serve European clients which may argue that the UK government’s handling of Brexit violated their legitimate expectations of moving to (and investing) in UK offices. But depending on the extent of losses and the final form of Brexit lawyers are likely to be busy investigating. Will there still be a City of London in April? The answer is yes. But it will be different no matter which shape Brexit eventually takes. In markets actions speak louder than words and booming sales of Brexit survival packs are certainly not a good sign.

A draft report on the impact of Brexit on Britain’s financial industry warns banks and staff would “leach” away undermining the wider UK economy if they do not have access to European Union markets according to sources who have read the report. The report has been written by law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer for TheCityUK which lobbies on behalf of the financial sector and may be published later this month when Britain formally starts divorce talks with the EU. Firms are already applying a “base case scenario” that when these talks end in two years’ time no access to EU markets will have been agreed the sources cited the report as saying. The report adds that even for financial services firms in Britain that do little direct business with the EU damage from such a “hard” Brexit to the “ecosystem” of financial legal and accounting services in Britain would hit them too. The warning is starker than the public comments from bankers and Bank of England officials Eroding the financial services industry would weaken Britain’s wider “gravitational pull” and hit other parts of the economy too the report says according to the sources. The warning is starker than the public comments from bankers and Bank of England officials who have said it would be hard for another financial centre in Europe to replicate Britain’s financial ecosystem. TheCityUK said in a statement it had commissioned Freshfields to produce the report but it was not yet complete and it was too early to make assumptions about the conclusions. Freshfields declined to comment. Under the most extreme scenario of no deal being reached with the EU banks based in London without a subsidiary in the EU would be unable to provide sales underwriting and distribution in the debt and equity capital markets on the continent the report says according to the sources. Banks would also be unable to provide investment advice portfolio management and lending to EU retail clients it adds. Early on in the Brexit negotiations both sides should agree that Britain can have a phased departure from the trading bloc to give governments and businesses longer to adapt the report says. Under the currently envisaged timetable the report warns banks will not have enough time to prepare themselves for Brexit and their possible departure. It also argues Brexit could give Britain an opportunity to “re-frame” regulation – a repeated demand of Brexit backers – the sources said. There are parts of UK regulation that “could be looked at to facilitate business being conducted in the UK” the report says. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Judge Floris Bakels said in a written ruling that \"there has to be more clarity about the consequences of Brexit for EU citizenship\" according to a statement by the court in Amsterdam. A group of British citizens who live in the Netherlands had asked the court to refer their case to the European Court of Justice last month in a bid to protect their EU citizenship rights after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. Officials negotiating Britain\\'s exit have made progress on the protection of rights of EU citizens living in Britain and UK citizens living on the continent but no full agreement has yet been reached on the issue. According to the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU any person who is a citizen of an EU nation is automatically also an EU citizen. EU citizenship grants rights including the ability to move work and live freely within the bloc. Christiaan Alberdingk Thijm the Dutch lawyer who represented the Britons in the Amsterdam court welcomed the ruling. He said: \"Theresa May famously said \\'Brexit means Brexit\\' but the Brits currently living on the continent have no idea what that means for them. \"Are you an EU citizen for life or can your citizenship be taken away from you? That is the fundamental question that will be put forward to the European Court.\" One of the Britons who filed the case Stephen Huyton who has lived in the Netherlands for 24 years said he was delighted with the decision. \"However this is but the first step to clarity about what Brexit means for our EU citizenship\" he said in a statement. \"This case has always been about seeking clarification.\" It was not immediately clear when the European Court of Justice would deliver answers to the questions. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British trade minister Liam Fox said \"intransigence\" from the European Union was pushing Britain towards a no-deal Brexit in an interview published on Saturday by the Sunday Times. With less than eight months until Britain quits the EU the government has yet to agree a divorce deal with Brussels and has stepped up planning for the possibility of leaving the bloc without any formal agreement. Fox a promiment Brexit supporter in Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s cabinet put the odds of Britain leaving the European Union without agreeing a deal over their future relationship at 60-40. \"I think the intransigence of the commission is pushing us towards no deal\" Fox told the Sunday Times after a trade mission in Japan. \"We have set out the basis in which a deal can happen but if the EU decides that the theological obsession of the unelected is to take priority over the economic wellbeing of the people of Europe then it\\'s a bureaucrats\\' Brexit -- not a people\\'s Brexit -- (and) then there is only going to be one outcome.\" It was up to the EU whether it wanted to put \"ideological purity\" ahead of the real economy Fox said. If Britain fails to agree the terms of its divorce with the EU and leaves without even a transition agreement to smooth its exit it would revert to trading under World Trade Organization rules in March 2019. Most economists think this would cause serious harm to the world\\'s No.5 economy as trade with the EU Britain\\'s largest market would become subject to tariffs. Supporters of Brexit say there may be some short-term pain for Britain\\'s $2.9 trillion economy but that long-term it will prosper when cut free from the EU which some of them cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration. On Friday Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the chances of a no-deal Brexit had become \"uncomfortably high\". \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Johnson who led the main Brexit campaign in the 2016 referendum resigned this month over May’s strategy triggering the government\\'s biggest crisis since she lost her parliamentary majority after calling a snap election last year. \"It is not too late to save Brexit\" Johnson told parliament in his resignation speech on Wednesday. \"We have time in these negotiations - we have changed tack once and we can change again. He added: \"The problem is not that we failed to make the case for a Free Trade Agreement of the kind spelt out (by May) at Lancaster House we haven\\'t even tried. We must try now because we will not get another chance to get it right.\" In a speech at London\\'s Lancaster House in January May listed 12 priorities for Brexit including the pursuit of a bold and ambitious free trade agreement with the EU and an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in Britain. Her government is now proposing to negotiate the closest possible commercial links - \"a common rule book\" - for goods trade with the bloc saying this is the only way to balance political and economic priorities for Brexit. But her plan finalised this month at a cabinet meeting at her country house of Chequers has pleased few on either side compounding the divisions within the Conservative Party that have so far frustrated progress in talks with the EU Many Brexit or \"Leave\" campaigners feel they are losing ground to voices questioning the meaning of the 2016 vote. Johnson warned against making the \"the fatal mistake of underestimating the intelligence of the public\" by saying one thing to the EU and pretending to do another thing to the public. \"It as though a fog of self-doubt has descended\" Johnson said. \"We should not and need not be stampeded by anyone.... Let us again aim explicitly for that glorious vision of Lancaster House ... not the miserable permanent limbo of Chequers.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit deal can be passed by the British parliament if the European Union provides clarification that the Northern Irish \"backstop\" will be temporary foreign minister Jeremy Hunt said on Friday. The backstop is an insurance policy designed to prevent the return of border checks between Ireland an EU member and British-ruled Northern Ireland. It is proving the biggest obstacle to a divorce deal between Britain and the EU. May pulled a vote on her divorce deal earlier this month after admitting that parliament would reject it. Lawmakers are set to discuss the agreement again next month with a vote in the week starting January 14. Parliament is deeply divided with both supporters and opponents of Brexit opposed to May\\'s deal which seeks to maintain close ties with the EU. Britain is due to leave the bloc on March 29 and the impasse has increased the chances of a no deal Brexit and led to growing calls for a second referendum. Hunt said May\\'s withdrawal agreement could be passed by lawmakers if the EU made clear that the Irish \"backstop\" would be time-limited. Critics fear the backstop will trap Britain in a customs union with the EU indefinitely while European leaders have said they would not renegotiate the treaty. \"If it is temporary then parliament can live with that\" Hunt told BBC radio. \"We can get this (the deal) through absolutely can.\" If May\\'s deal fails senior ministers are themselves split on what should happen. Some suggest that another referendum should be considered while others including Hunt favour a \"managed\" no-deal Brexit. May herself has said neither option is viable. Jeremy Corbyn leader of the opposition Labour Party said May should recall parliament early to allow a vote on her Brexit deal and warned it was a matter of \"when not if\" his party tried to force an election by proposing a vote of no-confidence in the government. Lawmakers (MPs) are not due to return until January 7 and Corbyn said the government was using the delay as a ploy to put pressure on parliament to accept her deal or risk a no-deal Brexit. \"What I suspect is that it\\'s a completely cynical manoeuvre to run down the clock and offer MPs the choice of the devil or the deep blue sea\" Corbyn said in an interview with the Independent newspaper. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The Netherlands will give Britons a 15-month grace period to apply to stay after Brexit if Britain crashes out of the European Union without a deal a Dutch minister has said. The Dutch move is aimed at calming fears of chaos for people and businesses in the event that there is no withdrawal agreement for Britain to leave the bloc on March 29. Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said late Monday the approximately 45000 Britons and their relatives living in the Netherlands would no longer be able to claim residency as EU citizens if there was a no-deal Brexit. \"To prevent this the cabinet proposes a 15-month transition period from the start of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU\" Blok said in a letter to parliament. During that period Britons who lived in the Netherlands before Brexit \"will keep their rights to live work and study in the Netherlands.\" \"British citizens and their relatives will be asked during the course of the transitional period to hand in a request for a definitive residency permit\" he added. British Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to protect the rights of European citizens living in Britain after Brexit so long as Britons get the same treatment abroad. Spain - one of the EU countries with the largest number of British residents - said on December 28 that it was preparing emergency measures to preserve their rights in Spain in the event of a no-deal Brexit. May secured an agreement with European Union leaders on Nov 25 that would see Britain leave the bloc on March 29 with continued close trade and residency ties. But concerns are mounting that May will be unable to \\xa0push the deal through a deeply divided British parliament. Britain\\'s interior ministry was recently accused of poor timing and insensitive language after tweeting out a \"jolly\" post-Christmas message telling EU nationals they have to apply to \\xa0stay after Brexit. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Treasury coffers will take a £66 billion (€73bn) annual hit if Britain goes for a so-called\\xa0hard Brexit Cabinet ministers have been warned. Leaked government papers suggest leaving the single market and switching to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules would cause GDP to fall by up to 9.5 per cent compared with if the country remained in the European Union. The draft Cabinet committee paper seen by The Times is based on forecasts from the controversial study into the predicted impact of quitting the EU published by George Osborne in April during the referendum campaign. Although the then chancellor faced widespread criticism over the report the Treasury stands by its calculations according to The Times. The documents says: \"The Treasury estimates that UK GDP would be between 5.4 per cent and 9.5 per cent of GDP lower after 15 years if we left the EU with no successor arrangement with a central estimate of 7.5 per cent.\" Theresa May It adds: \"The net impact on public sector receipts - assuming no contributions to the EU and current receipts from the EU are replicated in full - would be a loss of between £38 billion and £66 billion per year after 15 years driven by the smaller size of the economy.\" Brexit backers who have seen the documents told the newspaper the figures were unrealistic and claimed there was a push to \"make leaving the single market look bad\". But prominent Remain campaigners pushing for a \"soft\" Brexit that would keep Britain in the single market said the documents showed the \"horrific damage\" of leaving the trading bloc. Conservative former minister Anna Soubry a supporter of the Open Britain campaign said: \"The horrific damage of a\\xa0hard Brexit\\xa0is clear. Less tax revenue means less to invest in schools and hospitals lower trade and investment means businesses and jobs at risk. \"This danger is precisely why Parliament must be involved in the principles to guide the Brexit negotiations. \"Britain will leave the EU but we must do so in a way the protects our prosperity and reduces risk. The Government should now make clear the \\'WTO option\\' isn\\'t on the table.\" Brexit backers who have seen the documents told the newspaper the figures were unrealistic Prime Minister Theresa May is facing growing pressure to allow MPs a vote on Brexit and the Government is also fighting a legal challenge over the use of royal prerogative to invoke Article 50 the process for leaving the EU. Brexit Secretary David Davis told MPs the Government will \"observe the constitutional and legal precedents\" on giving MPs a vote on any treaty setting out Britain\\'s new relationship with the European Union. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the leaked documents showed quitting the single market would wreck the economy. \"This is yet more proof that\\xa0hard Brexit\\xa0would be an act of sheer economic vandalism\" he said. \"The Liberal Democrats will stand up for Britain\\'s membership of the single market. \"We cannot stand by while this reckless divisive and uncaring Conservative Government wrecks the UK economy.\" A Government spokesman said: \"We want the best outcome for Britain. That means pursuing a bespoke arrangement which gives British companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market and enables us to decide for ourselves how we control immigration.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Disagreement with Britain\\'s decision to quit the European Union has reached its highest point since the 2016 Brexit referendum according to a new poll. The YouGov survey found 47% of voters thought the decision to leave was wrong against just 40% who said it was the right thing to do - the widest margin since the weekly survey began two years ago. The findings come a week ahead of a series of crunch votes in the House of Commons as Prime Minister Theresa May seeks to overturn changes to her flagship Brexit legislation introduced in the Lords. Without an overall majority in the Commons the PM is expected to spend the coming days trying to sweet-talk and strong-arm potential rebels who could inflict defeat on some of the Government\\'s key Brexit positions. Mrs May\\'s decision to squeeze Commons consideration of the 15 Lords amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill into a single 12-hour day on June 12 provoked an angry reaction on the opposition benches. Labour industry spokeswoman Chi Onwurah branded it \"astounding\" accusing the Government of \"showing its contempt for democracy our future economy and parliamentary sovereignty\" while the Scottish National Party\\'s Drew Hendry said the timetable was driven by \"Tory self-interest\". Among the changes backed by peers are a requirement to negotiate a future customs union arrangement and a \"meaningful role\" for Parliament after the exit talks are complete. Brexit negotiations were resuming in Brussels with officials discussing remaining issues in the UK\\'s withdrawal agreement including the status of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. But with the Cabinet seemingly deadlocked on the Irish issue there was speculation that a White Paper spelling out the Government\\'s Brexit plans in detail may not appear before the upcoming EU leaders\\' summit on June 28-29. Downing Street declined to put a timeframe on the publication of the document and said it was working towards agreement in negotiations by October. Brussels and Dublin have made clear they want to see progress this month on proposed \"backstop\" arrangements to keep the Irish border open in the absence of any better solution from the UK. The 47% who told YouGov the Brexit decision was wrong was up three points on last week and equalled the highest figure since the tracker poll began in August 2016. The 40% saying the decision was right was down three points since last week and the lowest yet recorded. Some 73% of Labour voters and 83% of Lib Dems said the Brexit decision was wrong while 69% of Conservative voters said it was right. Some 81% of those who backed Leave in 2016 said they still believed it was the right decision with 9% now saying it was wrong. A majority (62%) said the Government was handling Brexit negotiations badly against 23% who thought it was doing well. Those backing the Brexit decision have outnumbered those who think it was wrong in the regular survey on only one occasion since July 2017. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Barnier also said the two should \"de-dramatise\" a backstop proposed by Brussels to avoid erecting a border on the island of Ireland after Brexit that would see the EU governing some of Northern Ireland trade. \"We are not asking for any new borders between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom\" Barnier said. \"We must all de-dramatise this backstop... Ultimately these are only technical controls on goods no more no less.\" The sensitive issue of the Irish border is a key conundrum in the Brexit talks. Barnier was speaking as British Prime Minister Theresa May sought to convince her divided government to her plan for Britain\\'s future after it leaves the EU next March and a status-quo transition period runs out at the end of 2020. \"We need a cast-iron guarantee in the withdrawal agreement to avoid a hard border whatever the result of negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU\" he said. He said some veterinary and phytosanitary checks were already being carried out between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Barnier reiterated that much remained to be done to reach a broad Brexit deal in October leaving enough time for the EU\\'s elaborate ratification process before the Brexit date in March. \"In the Brexit negotiations there are still too many questions and too few answers\" Barnier said. \"Time is short. We need to have quickly realistic and workable solutions.\" Barnier said outstanding issues included data protection cooperation between police and judicial authorities and how to settle legal disputes that may arise under the withdrawal deal. \"LOSE-LOSE GAME\" May\\'s plan for a \"facilitated customs arrangement\" would see Britain closely mirror EU rules and use technology to determine where goods will go and therefore which tariffs should apply. Barnier said he would only comment once the proposal was fully unveiled but suggested it may fall short: \"Some of these checks can be implemented by technical measures but not all.\" Barnier said the agreement on post-Brexit ties with Britain must ensure London would not be able to offer goods at a lower price should it decide to skip some EU standards. \"If we don\\'t find a way with the UK to prevent this kind of dumping the risk is we\\'ll face huge difficulties in the next stage when we will have to get agreement in 27 national parliaments and even regional parliaments in some cases\" he said referring to the need for ratification by EU states. He said Brexit was a \"lose-lose game\". Without a deal in place next March Britain would risk crashing out with little idea of what new rules govern its ties with the EU. With progress slow some EU diplomats expect tense 11th-hour talks at the turn of the year which may still prove insufficient. \"It seems more and more that Britain will have to ask for an extension of the two-year period for Brexit negotiations\" said one EU diplomat involved in the talks. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday suffered another defeat in parliament over her Brexit strategy just 43 days before Britain leaves the EU. The House of Commons rejected a government motion intended to express MPs\\' support for May as she seeks to renegotiate her Brexit deal with the European Union. Hardline eurosceptics in her Conservative party abstained from voting on the government\\'s non-binding motion which they believed raised the chances of avoiding a no-deal Brexit. Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said the defeat \"shows there is no majority for the PM\\'s course of action in dealing with Brexit.\" \"She cannot keep on just running down the clock and hoping that something will turn up that will save her day and save her face\" he said of May who was not in parliament for the defeat. Leading Brexiteer Liam Fox earlier warned colleagues that defeat would raise doubts about whether a renegotiated deal could get through parliament making the EU less likely to make an offer. \"Our European partners will be watching our debate and listening today to see if they get the impression that if they were to make those concessions parliament would definitely deliver\" trade minister Fox told BBC Radio 4.\\xa0 \"There\\'s a danger that we send the wrong signals.\" - Talks at \\'crucial stage\\' -Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer accused May of deliberately wasting time to ramp up pressure to pass her deal and warned that MPs would not let her leave without a deal. \"As for the Prime Minister taking us out of the EU on the 29th of March of this year without a deal -- we\\'ll see about that. \"I think the majority in this House will do everything they can to prevent that\" he added. May\\'s initial deal was roundly rejected by British MPs last month but later parliamentary votes suggested a slim majority for her deal if she could get rid of the backstop clause. The provision is intended to keep the border with Ireland free-flowing but some fear it could leave Britain trapped in EU trade rules indefinitely with no withdrawal mechanism. British officials have since held a series of meeting with EU counterparts who have ruled out reopening negotiations. \"The talks are at a crucial stage. We now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this house requires and deliver Brexit on time\" May told lawmakers on Tuesday. \"Having secured an agreement with the EU for further talks we now need some time to complete that process\" she said. The announcement was seen by political commentators as an attempt to stave off the threat of parliamentary rebellion with MPs now having to wait until February 27 for another series of votes on what to do if no agreement is reached. Business leaders and economists have warned of shockwaves around the continent if no transition deal is in place when Britain leaves the EU. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Investors sold sterling and stocks yesterday seeking shelter in gold and the Japanese yen as uncertainty over Britain’s departure from the European Union and the policies of US President-elect Donald Trump curbed appetite for risky assets. US markets were closed for the Martin Luther King Day holiday crimping market activity and potentially exacerbating price moves. The dollar rose except against the yen rebounding after suffering its worst week since November last week when it was hit by a lack of clarity over what Mr Trump whose inauguration is on Friday will do once he assumes office. The price of gold a frequently sought haven for investors in uncertain times hit its highest level since November. Yields on low-risk German government bonds fell but those on Italian equivalents edged up after rating agency DBRS cut Italy’s credit rating late on Friday a move that could raise borrowing costs for the country’s banks. But the eye-catching mover was Britain’s pound a day before a speech by British Prime Minister Theresa May. Media reported that she would lay out an exit from the EU that would see Britain lose access to the bloc’s single market. The pound fell as low as $1.1983 in thin early Asian trade which barring a sudden “flash crash” in October was its weakest against the dollar in 32 years. The fall in sterling which makes UK exports cheaper has contributed to an unprecedented 14-day rally in the blue-chip FTSE 100 stock index. The index fell 0.2 per cent yesterday but still outperformed continental Europeanmarkets. The main STOXX 600 index fell 0.8 per cent as declines in autos and banks offset a rally in eyewear makers Luxottica and Essilor who agreed a €46 billion merger. German carmakers BMW Daimler and VW fell between 1.6 and 1.8 per cent after Trump warned he would impose a 35 per cent border tax on vehicles imported to the US market. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.6 per cent Japan’s Nikkei lost one per cent as the yen hit exporters. Sterling last traded at $1.2055 down one per cent on the day. The euro was up 0.6 per cent at 87.97 pence while the yen was up 0.8 per cent at 137.40 to the pound. The dollar index which measures the US currency against six of its peers rose 0.4 per cent. The euro fell 0.4 per cent to $1.0602 while the yen another perceived safe haven investment rose 0.5 per cent to 113.99 per dollar. German 10-year bond yields fell 2 basis points to 0.25 per cent. Italian 10-year yields by contrast rose marginally to 1.90 per cent. Italy’s downgrade will mean Italian banks will have to pay more to borrow money from the European Central Bank when they use the country’s sovereign bonds as collateral. It may also make Italian debt less attractive for foreign buyers. Oil held steady though doubts that large oil producers will cut output as agreed by the Organisation of the Oil Producing Countries and others put prices under pressure. Brent the international benchmark last traded at $55.37 a barrel down eight cents on the day. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Dylan Martinez/Reuters  British banks are prepping staff to deal with a barrage of questions from retail and small business customers after the country’s June 23 vote on whether to stay in or leave the European Union. HSBC Barclays Lloyds RBS and Nationwide have all briefed staff on how to respond to customer queries on both outcomes of the vote with foreign exchange risks expected to be the biggest concern according to sources at the banks. The banks have circulated question and answer scenarios to staff with suggestions on how to respond to specific questions particularly if a vote to leave triggers a sharp fall in the pound. Call centre staff at HSBC’s customer contact centres across Britain have been given scripts detailing responses to likely customer questions. Building society Nationwide said it had also been advising its teams on how to respond. “Our employees have been briefed and if our members have concerns or questions in relation to this matter we will address those with them” a spokesman for Nationwide said. The other banks declined to comment in detail on their plans. Companies need to consider how they hedge against such risk easier to understand One bank which asked not to be identified said its own Q&A document included whether a ‘leave’ vote would make a customer’s mortgage more expensive; whether it might affect a student studying in Europe; and whether investments would be impacted. Some small businesses may be among those most in need of help because not that many have taken out insurance against a sharp move in the pound following the referendum. Customer questions about taking out insurance on the value of the pound have increased four-fold in the last six to eight weeks according to Abhishek Sachdev managing director of Vedanta which advises small businesses on hedging risk. Sachdev said 10-day volatility in the sterling/euro had increased from six per cent to 14 per cent in the last two weeks showing the impact of recent opinion polls which have highlighted that the result may be too close to call. “This kind of volatility is making our message that companies need to consider how they hedge against such risk easier to understand because customers are scared” Sachdev said. Four-fifths of Britain’s major companies have hedged against the risk that a vote to leave the European Union would knock more than 10 per cent off the value of sterling a poll of almost 800 of the top 1000 showed last month. But only 22 per cent of smaller businesses said they had hedged the survey showed. The close nature of polls attempting to predict the outcome has made it difficult for smaller companies to decide whether they need to ‘hedge’ or insure against such currency risks bankers said. Polls yesterday showed the campaign for Britain to leave the EU has taken a four to five percentage point lead sending sterling towards three-week lows against the US dollar. “For a small business owner it’s hard to know whether to hedge: you either did the deal of a lifetime or destroyed a lot of value come June 24” a senior banker at one of Britain’s big four banks said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Investors swapped equities for less risky assets such as US treasury bonds and the Japanese yen yesterday on fears about the potential impact of the British referendum vote in less than two weeks on whether it should leave the European Union. An index of world equity markets fell after having snapped a five-day winning streak on Thursday while oil prices slid and were off 2016 highs hit this week due to a stronger dollar. US Treasury yields which move in the opposite direction of prices fell to more than three-month lows as European sovereign debt yields plunged on continuing concerns about global growth and a potential British exit from the EU. Britain will hold a referendum on its European Union membership on June 23. Though bookmakers’ odds point towards a British vote to stay in the EU polls suggest a neck-to-neck race. Ten-year yields in Germany Japan and Britain all struck record lows. German Bund yields the benchmark for borrowing costs across the eurozone have fallen almost 10 basis points in little over a week to as low as 0.021 per cent. Investors ditched stocks in favour of assets considered safer during times of economic uncertainty such as bonds gold and the yen. Wall Street followed the lead of Asian and European stocks and fell. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 96.94 points or 0.54 per cent at 17888.25 the S&P 500 lost 16.29 points or 0.77 per cent at 2099.19 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 49.22 points or 0.99 per cent at 4909.39. The MSCI world equity index of shares in 45 nations was down 1.37 per cent. Europe’s broad FTSEurofirst 300 index suffered its biggest drop in four months. The index fell 2.34 per cent at 1308.83 as political worries put pressure on cyclical stocks. In the currency market the yen and Swiss franc rose as oil prices slid and bank shares led global equity markets lower stoking a fresh wave of bids for low-risk assets. The US dollar index held earlier gains against a basket of currencies after University of Michigan data showed US consumer sentiment eroded less than forecast in early June led by an unexpectedly improved view of current economic conditions. The index was up 0.49 per cent at 94.409. Gold rebounded to a fresh three-week high as investor risk aversion lifted appetite for the metal. Spot gold was up 0.21 per cent to $1271.11 an ounce. Oil prices fell more than two per cent as investors braced for another likely rise in the US oil rig count this week and the firmer dollar weighed on demand for crude futures denominated in the greenback. Brent crude was down 2.43 per cent at $50.69 a barrel while US crude was down 2.75 per cent at $49.17. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The UK\\'s\\xa0minister for Brexit David Jones said today that\\xa0\"friends don\\'t punish friends\" and the UK therefore did not expect friends to punish it. The remarks of Mr Jones who is in Malta to attend a meeting of the EU general affairs council could be interpreted as a message to Prime Minister Joseph Muscat who has been accused by certain media quarters of adopting a tough stand towards Britain. British prime minister Theresa May last week said that her country was prepared to leave the EU\\'s single market to achieve control of its borders. She also warned that no deal (on trade) would be better than a bad deal for Britain. The EU had warned the UK that it could not cherry pick what it wanted. Mr Jones said the two-year Brexit time frame to conclude trade negotiations was realistic. \"In no way am I suggesting it is going to be easy but it can be done if there is the will because the UK already embodies all EU legislation which makes us different from Canada\" he said. Last week Dr Muscat said no government would be in its right senses to offer Britain a Brexit deal that was better than membership. “It would be quite stupid to settle for EU membership ourselves if it is then inferior to the Brexit arrangements. That is something that is keeping us together.” Mr Jones was addressing the Maltese media at the residence of the British High Commission. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a last ditch bid by the British government to stop Europe\\'s top court from considering a case which seeks to determine whether London can unilaterally reverse Brexit. Scottish politicians who are opposed to Britain exiting the European Union want the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to clarify whether London can withdraw its notification to leave without permission from the EU\\'s other member states. Pro-EU supporters who want a second referendum are hoping the case will give the option that Britain could change its mind in a second referendum and remain in the bloc after all. The ECJ is due to hear the case on November 27. In a final attempt to prevent the referral the British government asked the Supreme Court whether it would hear an appeal but on Tuesday three of the country\\'s top judges rejected the application. The government had argued that whether or not Britain could reverse the decision was immaterial since ministers had no intention of doing so. The anti-Brexit petitioners are hoping the ECJ will rule that Britain has a legal unilateral option of staying in the EU the world\\'s biggest trading bloc once the final outcome of divorce negotiations are known. Last week May concluded a withdrawal agreement with the EU but many in her own party along with the small Northern Irish party which props up her minority government and opposition lawmakers have said they will oppose it. She has said the country faces three options: backing her deal leaving the EU in a disorderly \"no deal\" Brexit which would be very disruptive for businesses and citizens or no Brexit. It is not clear when the ECJ might issue its ruling to clarify the interpretation of Article 50 of the EU treaty under which London last year gave two years\\' notice of its departure. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: AFP  Britain\\'s chances of leaving the European Union are only \"50-50\" if MPs reject Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit deal a senior minister warned Sunday. Liam Fox the international trade secretary and a vocal Brexit campaigner during the 2016 referendum warned colleagues planning on voting against May that her plan was the only way to be \"100 percent certain\" that Britain would leave. \"If we were not to vote for that I\\'m not sure I would give it much more than 50-50\" he told The Sunday Times.

Pro-Brexit supporters are particularly concerned about the deal\\'s so-called \"backstop\" provision which could keep Britain locked in a customs union with the EU in order to avoid a \"hard\" border between British province Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But Fox urged his colleagues to \"put their own pride behind them\" and take what was on offer. \"The worst possible outcome of this process would be no Brexit\" he told the paper. \"For me that would induce a sense that we had betrayed the people that voted in the referendum. \"What you can be sure of is that if we vote for the prime minister\\'s deal then its 100 percent certain that we will leave on March 29.\" He also warned parliament against trying to thwart the process through a series of legislative procedures. \"Shattering that bond of trust between parliament and the people I think would be incendiary\" he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Fitch\\'s top sovereign analyst James McCormack told Reuters that crashing out of the European Union next March without a transition deal was likely to send Britain into a recession. While it could be mild one if the turmoil gets resolved quickly a more pessimistic outcome was expected to see the British economy contract 0.6 percentage point for 2019 as a whole. \"Clearly the deficit would be going up more substantially in the deeper recession scenario and that would almost certainly reverse the course of the debt-to-GDP reduction and would almost certainly have a rating impact\" McCormack said.\\xa0Crashing out of the European Union next March without a transition deal was likely to send Britain into a recession Fitch has kept a \\'negative outlook\\' - effectively a downgrade warning - on Britain\\'s rating since it cut it to AA from AA+ in the wake of the 2016 Brexit vote.

Read the original article. \\nPhoto: AFP  There is a slight problem with Labour’s attempt to blame Theresa May’s obstinacy for the likely failure of talks between the Conservatives and Labour on how to end the Brexit deadlock: the prime minister has compromised on almost everything. May’s only political objective which long precedes Brexit is controlling immigration. It is her biggest weakness – creating a myopia which resulted for instance in the Windrush scandal. But it is also the scene of her greatest triumph. The withdrawal deal agreed with the EU effectively ends free movement of labour. It gives ground on everything else and is in fact perfectly aligned to Labour’s professed Brexit policy. May is spectacularly bad at PR but in terms of policy the deal was a remarkable achievement.\\xa0Her motives in inviting Labour to talks may not have been pure and her tactics may be amateurish but does anyone really believe she wants the talks to fail? The notion that May has been hamstrung by the hard Brexit contingent in her own party has been overstated. Her “no deal is better than a bad deal” mantra has been much misunderstood since it referred to no trade deal rather than no withdrawal deal (although admittedly May’s rhetoric was deliberately vague in this regard). She has of course had to keep up appearances for the sake of party unity but her Chequers plan (remember that?) definitively revealed she had forsaken the hard Brexiters. The direction of policy ever since has only been softwards. It has become a cliché to argue that Jeremy Corbyn is for various reasons seeking to ensure Brexit happens – while avoiding the blame. This is true enough but too simplistic. Corbyn is not an ardent Brexiter but rather indifferent to Brexit and content to allow the chaos of Brexit to persist as long as it creates the possibility of achieving his own overriding aim: forcing a general election. Despite May’s victories in two confidence votes and the likelihood Labour would lose a general election the party’s election-first policy remains in place. The prospect of a general election means Corbyn can just about hold off demands from within his own support base for a second referendum although it is increasingly clear Labour will only be able to force an election after Brexit finally occurs rather than as a way of breaking the Brexit logjam. As such Corbyn’s position is no longer compatible with Labour’s agreed policy at all. But the talks with May offer an opportunity to continue to make the case for an election. The best-case scenario for Corbyn is that he can be seen to be attempting to compromise with May thereby strengthening the case for an election if she refuses. Labour’s frontbenchers continue to bemoan May’s intransigence yet they must be aware that most of their ostensible objectives are already in the bag. The “backstop” encapsulates Labour’s position and the political declaration is vague enough to allow a future government of either party to shape the only deal with the EU that really matters.\\xa0Corbyn’s position is no longer compatible with Labour’s agreed policy at all The main task of shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer at the moment appears to be finding a form of words on the customs union and workers’ rights which allows Labour to claim that it has won a concession from May while being careful not to actually unpick the withdrawal deal or political declaration. Labour still isn’t ready to answer the kind of questions these concessions would raise about its actual Brexit preferences. So it continues to peddle the line about May’s obstinacy. There have been times in the past couple of years when Starmer has seemed to represent a singular voice of sincerity on Brexit across both front benches. But the Brexit quagmire drags even the best of us down eventually. Labour’s only substantive criticism of May’s withdrawal deal is one of process not content – apparently the prime minister has failed to “reach out”. So on top of everything else she plays along. She reaches out. Yes the offer of talks was in part an attempt to shift the blame for likely failure on to the opposition. But let’s not underestimate just how much May has sacrificed on her own benches just by offering to talk to Corbyn. The illusion that she is trying to keep the ERG on board is finally shattered – and the Conservative Party may well not survive. May even appears to have conceded the prospect of a confirmatory vote in return for parliament finally passing her withdrawal problem. And herein lies Corbyn’s double dilemma. He does not want to agree to the deal because an orderly Brexit would mean the prospect of a general election recedes. And he does not want a second referendum because he cannot possibly fight another referendum on EU membership without fatally exposing the contradictions within his own support base. Much better that the talks fail. Labour can easily ensure they get no concessions from May by not actually asking for any. May simply does not get it. She does not understand the fatalism of the creed which now rules the Labour Party. For May Brexit is a necessary evil – and the Brexit negotiations an exercise in damage limitation. Her motives in inviting Labour to talks may not have been pure and her tactics may be amateurish but does anyone really believe she wants the talks to fail? She does not. She just wants her deal – the only version of withdrawal the EU will accept that comes anywhere close to respecting her interpretation of the referendum result – to get through. The Labour leadership in contrast seems determined to ensure the talks fail. And indeed fail in a very specific way that is one which prevents the question of a second referendum even being posed. There are nevertheless contingencies here. If May does succeed in securing an extension to Article 50 or agrees to the much longer extension requested by the EU the calculus shifts. Similarly there may be a second referendum option as part of a “binding indicative votes” process if May shames Corbyn into supporting Labour’s own policy. But even if this option gets Labour’s formal backing Corbyn might have created just enough confusion around whether the party’s election-first policy still stands to undermine the “last resort” rationale for a second referendum which many Labour MPs have concocted. There also remains the slim possibility of a revolt against Corbyn which will see a second referendum pushed more aggressively by Labour. But I think his position is largely unimpeachable. I also think he will get his general election – but only after the UK leaves the EU without a withdrawal deal.

Japan warned Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday that its companies would have to leave Britain if trade barriers after Brexit made them unprofitable. Japanese firms have spent more than £40 billion in Britain encouraged by successive governments since Margaret Thatcher promising them a business-friendly base from which to trade across the continent. But after May and several of her top ministers met bosses from 19 Japanese businesses including Nissan SoftBank and bank Nomura Japan\\'s ambassador to Britain issued an unusually blunt warning on the risks of trade barriers. \"If there is no profitability of continuing operations in the UK - not Japanese only - then no private company can continue operations\" Koji Tsuruoka told reporters on Downing Street when asked how real the threat was to Japanese companies of Britain not securing frictionless EU trade. \"So it is as simple as that\" he said. \"This is all high stakes that all of us I think need to keep in mind.\" Japan the world\\'s third largest economy has expressed unusually strong public concerns about the impact of Brexit on the United Kingdom the second-most important destination for Japanese investment after the United States. If there is no profitability of continuing operations in the UK - not Japanese only - then no private company can continue operations In a warning after the shock 2016 Brexit vote Japan expressed fears about a cliff edge that could disrupt trade when Britain formally leaves the bloc in March 2019. Major corporations have sought a two-year transition period which they hope will ease Britain into its new relationship with the bloc. Both London and Brussels hope to agree a transition deal lasting until the end of 2020 in which Britain would remain in the single market and be bound by all EU laws by a March 22-23 summit. May and her ministers assured Japanese businesses of the importance of maintaining free and frictionless trade after Brexit during the meeting but said nothing firm on the matter a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters. \"The point about frictionless trade and tariff-free trade was made in the meeting and acknowledged by the government and all sides as being important but nothing firm\" said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity. CUSTOMS UNION UNCERTAINTY A spokesman at May\\'s office said she had agreed with them on the need to move on quickly in the Brexit talks to secure a trading relationship with the EU that is as tariff-free and frictionless as possible after the transition period. Thursday\\'s meeting came after a Brexit sub-committee of ministers discussed their Brexit strategy including how closely Britain should remain aligned with the EU and its customs union a divisive issue for the ruling Conservatives. Brexit minister David Davis said there was still progress to be made in the committee after disagreements between ministers erupted into the public domain. Hitachi Europe\\'s deputy chairman Stephen Gomersall Mitsubishi CEO for Europe and Africa Haruki Hayashi SoftBank Investment Advisers UK CEO Rajeev Misra and Nomura\\'s executive chairman in Europe the Middle East and Africa Yasuo Kashiwagi joined the meeting with Japanese investors. Nissan\\'s Europe chairman Paul Willcox Honda\\'s senior vice president in Europe Ian Howells and Toyota\\'s Europe president and chief executive Johan van Zyl were also present.

Britain and the European Union are \"closing in\" on a withdrawal agreement Brexit minister Dominic Raab said on Friday before a meeting of European leaders in Salzburg next week. Britain is due to leave the bloc on March 29 but has yet to reach a full exit deal with Brussels and some rebels lawmakers in Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Conservative Party have threatened to vote against any agreement unless she changes her proposals. Both London and Brussels are hoping to reach a deal by mid-November. May has said next week\\'s informal EU summit will be a \"staging post\" in the negotiations that will allow the bloc\\'s leaders to discuss her Brexit plans for the first time. \"While there remain some substantive differences we need to resolve it is clear our teams are closing in on workable solutions to the outstanding issues in the Withdrawal Agreement and are having productive discussions in the right spirit on the future relationship\" Raab said after a phone call with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier. \"We reiterated our willingness to devote the necessary time and energy to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion\" he said adding that the pair agreed to take stock again following the Salzburg summit. Barnier said on Twitter that he had had a \"useful dialogue\" with Raab but that key differences remained between the EU and Britain over the future of the Irish border and the EU\\'s system of protecting food names. On Thursday the government published a set of advice notices for Britons on how to prepare for the possibility of a \"no-deal\" Brexit and May held a meeting of her top team of ministers to discuss the government\\'s plans for leaving without an agreement. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney told the meeting Britain\\'s property market would crash and mortgage rates would spiral up in the event of a chaotic no-deal Brexit with house prices falling 35 per cent over three years the Times newspaper reported. The Co-Operative Britain\\'s sixth-largest supermarket group said it could not guarantee shortages of some food products would be avoided in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Pro-Brexit rebels in May\\'s party have become increasingly vocal in their opposition to her Brexit proposals this week with one former junior minister saying 80 or more of May\\'s lawmakers were prepared to vote against them. The opposition Labour Party\\'s foreign affairs spokeswoman Emily Thornberry told the Financial Times her party was set to vote against any Brexit deal and the lack of a viable exit from the EU would force May from office before Christmas. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s Brexit secretary Dominic Raab resigned on Thursday in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s deal for leaving the European Union. \"I regret to say that following the Cabinet meeting yesterday on the Brexit deal I must resign\" he said in a statement on Twitter. Raab said May\\'s plan threatened the integrity of the United Kingdom Earlier the EU\\xa0said its leaders will meet on Nov. 25 to endorse the\\xa0\\xa0Brexit divorce deal but British Prime Minister Theresa May was mauled by opponents allies and mutinous members of her party who warned the agreement could sink her premiership. May won the backing of her senior ministers after a five-hour meeting on Wednesday though she now faces the much more perilous struggle of getting parliament which has the final say to approve the agreement. It is unclear when that vote might happen. \"If nothing extraordinary happens we will hold a European Council meeting in order to finalise and formalise the Brexit agreement\" European Council President Donald Tusk said after meeting EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. More than two years after the United Kingdom voted in a referendum to leave the EU May said the deal was the best the world\\'s fifth-largest economy could hope for and that the other options were leaving with no deal or thwarting Brexit. But in a sign of just how hard the vote in the British parliament might be Shailesh Vara who backed EU membership in the 2016 referendum quit on Thursday as a junior minister in May\\'s government. \"I cannot support the Withdrawal Agreement that has been agreed with the European Union\" Vara said as he resigned as a Northern Ireland minister. \"We are a proud nation and it is a sad day when we are reduced to obeying rules made by other countries who have shown they do not have our best interests at heart. We can and must do better than this.\" \"CAPITULATION\" Nick Timothy one of May\\'s former chiefs of staff said her deal was a capitulation that parliament would reject. \"When parliament rejects the prime minister’s proposal as surely it will there will still be time for ministers to negotiate something better\" Timothy wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper. Timothy who resigned after May\\'s botched gamble on a snap election that lost her party its majority in parliament said Britain should use its security contribution as a bargaining chip to get a better deal.  May will give a statement to parliament on Thursday on the deal which she hopes will satisfy both Brexit voters and EU supporters by ensuring close ties with the bloc after Britain leaves on March 29. The ultimate outcome for the United Kingdom remains uncertain: scenarios range from a calm divorce to rejection of May\\'s deal potentially sinking her premiership and leaving the bloc with no agreement or another referendum. Getting a deal through parliament will be difficult. She will need the votes of about 320 of the 650 lawmakers. \"The parliamentary arithmetic has looked tight for some time\" Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients. \"It now looks tighter given signs of greater unity among those who object to the draft Agreement.\" \"We\\'re in the Brexs**t - Theresa May\\'s soft Brexit deal blasted by ALL sides\" read the headline in The Sun Britain\\'s best read newspaper. The Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which props up May\\'s government said it would not back any deal that treated the British province differently from the rest of the United Kingdom. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The Bank of England said on Wednesday it would spare European banks costly extra capital requirements once Britain leaves the European Union but said there would be \"consequences\" if Brexit talks turn sour. Setting out its position for a possible tussle with Brussels over London\\'s position as a global financial hub the BoE said it wanted to ensure it could effectively oversee foreign banks and financial services firms after Brexit. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said big European banks operating in Britain would face little change if their supervisors in the EU cooperated with London after Brexit. \"But we retain all our options and if that is not forthcoming there will be consequences for those institutions\" he told lawmakers shortly after the BoE plan was published. The BoE would allow larger banks - for example with assets of more than £15 billion in Britain - to operate as branches in the UK only if their home supervisors agreed to cooperate more closely with the BoE By allowing EU banks to function normally at least for now the BoE\\'s announcement represents the first salvo in an expected struggle with the EU over banking rules that will decide the fate of London\\'s lucrative financial centre for decades to come. Prime Minister Theresa May has said Britain would leave the EU\\'s single market raising questions about how companies in Britain will do business in the bloc after Brexit and how European companies can operate in Britain. A so-called hard Brexit under which Britain leaves the EU with no trade deal would make cross-border supervisory cooperation harder and potentially hurt banks such as Germany\\'s Deutsche Bank which has a big presence in London. The BoE would allow larger banks - for example with assets of more than £15 billion in Britain - to operate as branches in the UK only if their home supervisors agreed to cooperate more closely with the BoE. Otherwise they would be classed as subsidiaries which would require them to park costly extra capital in Britain. There are 77 branches of banks from the European Economic Area in Britain - 23 of which have assets of around or above £15 billion - plus 80 branches of insurers from the EEA. The BoE\\'s proposal indicated a softer British position than that of the EU which has insisted that London-based banks would lose access to EU banking markets after Brexit if Britain sticks to its plan to impose new controls on migration one of the conditions for membership of the single market. London vies with New York for the title of the world\\'s financial capital. It dominates the $5.1-trillion-a-day global foreign exchange market and is home to more banks than any other centre. But many other EU capitals see Brexit as an opportunity to grab new business. The EU has already proposed that clearing of euro-denominated derivatives which are done mainly in London could move to the eurozone after Brexit if there is no comprehensive Brexit deal between EU and UK regulators. The BoE\\'s conditions on whether branches should become subsidiaries will be seen as a riposte the euro clearing plans in Brussels which also emphasises the need for strong supervisory cooperation to avoid forced relocation. The tough EU line on banking is extremely sensitive for the United Kingdom which collects over £70 billion a year in tax from the financial services sector. EU banks would have to find up to €40 billion if all their branches in Britain were turned into subsidiaries The BoE plans to start the process of reauthorising the branches of up to 200 EEA financial firms in Britain in early 2018. It hopes Britain will secure a Brexit transition deal to start after Brexit in March 2019 to give regulators more time. The new policy will not affect how banks from outside the EU such as Japan Switzerland and the United States are currently supervised by the BoE. The BoE had said it would let foreign banks know before the end of 2017 whether their existing branches in Britain must reapply for licences to operate after Brexit or be turned into costlier stand-alone subsidiaries. Management consultancy Boston Consulting Group estimated that EU banks would have to find up to €40 billion if all their branches in Britain were turned into subsidiaries. Earlier this year BoE Governor Mark Carney called for Britain and the EU to recognise each others\\' bank rules after Brexit or risk a potentially damaging hit to financial services across Europe. Deutsche Bank has 9000 staff in London. France\\'s BNP Paribas and Societe Generale have 6500 and 4000 respectively. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Conservative Party faces a \"catastrophic split\" if she persists with her proposals on Brexit which 80 or more of her lawmakers are prepared to vote against a former junior minister said. Such public criticism a day after former foreign minister Boris Johnson described her Brexit plans as \"a suicide vest\" wrapped around the British constitution indicates how hard it could be for May to get any Brexit deal approved. Steve Baker a former junior Brexit minister who resigned over May\\'s so-called Chequers proposals on Brexit told the Press Association that May faced a massive problem at the September 30-October 3 party conference. If 80 of May\\'s 315 lawmakers voted against a Brexit deal based on her proposals the fate of the government and exit process would depend on the opposition Labour Party because she would not command the 320 votes needed to dominate parliament.\\xa0Adding just two minutes onto every lorry’s customs procedure passing through Dover would produce a 14-mile tailback on either side of the Channel after one day \"If we come out of conference with her hoping to get Chequers through on the back of Labour votes I think the EU negotiators would probably understand that if that were done the Tory party would suffer the catastrophic split which thus far we have managed to avoid\" Baker was quoted as saying. Other Conservatives have given much more modest estimates of the number of lawmakers who oppose her plans. While some Brexiteers are unhappy with her premiership they see May as their best immediate hope of ensuring the UK leaves the EU. The United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29 yet little is clear. There is so far no full exit deal and it is uncertain whether May can push an agreement through the British parliament. May spokesman said she hopes parliament will support her Brexit plan which is \"the only plan on the table which will deliver on the will of the British people while avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland\". \"POLITICAL BLACKMAIL\" While the EU in recent weeks has given signs it is seeking to ease May into a deal by offering compromises she is facing an increasingly vociferous group of committed Brexiteers who feel she has been far too weak with the EU. Under May\\'s proposals Britain will seek a free trade area for goods with the EU largely by accepting a \"common rulebook\" for goods and British participation in EU agencies that provide authorisations for goods. Some Brexiteers say those proposals would ensure the EU kept control over swathes of the British economy and thus run counter to the spirit of her manifesto pledge to leave the EU Customs Union and the Single Market. In an article in the Mail on Sunday newspaper Johnson pressed his attack on May\\'s plan calling it \"a humiliation\" that opens \"ourselves to perpetual political blackmail\". London and Brussels say they want to get a divorce deal at the October 18 EU Council or at the latest by the end of the year. Any deal with the EU must be approved by the British parliament which is due to go on Christmas holiday from December 20 to January 7. If British lawmakers reject a deal in late December or early January Britain would face the prospect of leaving the EU three months later without an agreement. Without a deal the UK would move from seamless trade with the rest of the European Union to customs arrangements set by the World Trade Organisation for external states with no preferential deals. Some business leaders have warned that adding just two minutes onto every lorry’s customs procedure passing through the southern English port of Dover would produce a 14-mile tailback on either side of the Channel after one day. Uncertainty over Brexit and its impact on the pound is making it hard to predict the future profitability of Primark the owner of the discount fashion chain warned on Monday. \"Of all the years that I\\'ve sat in this chair this coming year is one of the most difficult to give guidance on because there is this uncertainty of the Brexit outcome\" Associated British Foods finance director John Bason told Reuters. Supporters of Brexit acknowledge there may be some short-term pain for the UK’s £2.2 trillion economy but say it will prosper in the long term when cut free from the EU which they cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration. Baker said May should seek a Free Trade Agreement under the terms placed on the table by European Council president Donald Tusk in March PA reported. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

More than two years since the 2016 EU referendum the United Kingdom its politicians and its business leaders remain deeply divided over Brexit while Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to clinch a divorce deal with the EU. Opponents of Brexit are exploring ways to stop what they say is Britain\\'s biggest mistake since World War Two. Miller is leading a campaign to have another referendum but she said if the government manages to successfully navigate an exit deal then politicians must be allowed to focus on domestic issues without the distractions of a debate about Britain\\'s relationship with Europe. \"Whatever happens at the end of the Brexit process we have got to draw a line under it\" Miller told Reuters on Friday in an interview in Mayfair in central London. \"Everyone is obsessed. Our bandwidth is completely taken up with Brexit. Our money our time... We can\\'t carry on like this. We need to make the best of it.\" The complexity of delivering Brexit has sapped the government\\'s time as officials focus on creating new systems for policing immigration and customs settling the rights of citizens in each other\\'s countries negotiating a potential exit bill and preparing to strike new trade deals. Miller who co-founded an investment management company and campaigns for transparency in the industry is one of the most outspoken campaigners on Brexit best known for successfully taking the government to the Supreme Court to challenge its authority to leave the EU without a vote in parliament. Brexit reversed? She now wants a rerun of the 2016 EU referendum this time offering voters the option of leaving on the terms of May’s deal or staying in a reformed EU. She has been vilified in the pro-Brexit media and faced death threats harassment and racial abuse for her views. Opinion polls show Britain remains deeply divided over Brexit though some recent surveys have shown a swing towards support for staying in the EU. While pro-EU supporters have praised Miller opponents have cast her as a wealthy member of an establishment which wants to soften or slow Brexit in defiance of the wishes of the people. Campaigners on both sides of the argument have been stepping up their efforts in recent weeks as some Brexiteers argue for a cleaner break from the EU and Remainers say ending membership as currently planned would do economic damage to Britain. Miller says it is \"very likely\" Britain will need to hold a second referendum on EU membership or a general election to break the deadlock over Brexit. Some eurosceptic rebels in May\\'s party and opposition parties have publicly said they will oppose the prime minister\\'s plans to leave the EU. If the opposition parties and just over a dozen rebels in May\\'s party vote against a deal she would fall short of the majority needed to get her deal through parliament. This would plunge British politics into crisis and increase the likelihood that Britain would face leaving the EU without an agreement or face the possibility of another general election or a second referendum. \"There\\'s no way out other than to give it back to the people\" Miller said. \"It is only morally and democratically right to give people a say.\" Miller said though if the government does eventually pass a deal then she is not interested in leading a campaign for Britain to re-enter the EU in the future. She would instead like to campaign on other constitutional issues like devolving policy and government spending away from London to the rest of the United Kingdom. \"At what point do you need to say that the country needs to get on with being a country? You can\\'t have a nation living in stress\" Miller said. \"Whatever happens there has to be an amnesty.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A dogged but isolated Prime Minister Theresa May headed back to Brussels on Thursday to beg for more time to deliver her Brexit plan but EU leaders are likely to refuse her request for a three-month postponement. Instead as the 28 heads of government meet for their spring summit they will tell her that if she can win over British lawmakers to back her withdrawal agreement next week she can have until May 22 to get Britain\\'s house in order. And if the withdrawal agreement is rejected again an emergency summit could be called next week to agree a longer extension until at least the end of 2019 - otherwise Britain\\'s four-decade-year-old European adventure will come to an abrupt end on March 29. Time is tight but there will be no final decision on a Brexit date in Brussels on Thursday and May seemed only to have hurt her own efforts to persuade more MPs to back the withdrawal agreement when she blamed them for the impasse in an eve-of-summit speech. \"All MPs have been willing to say is what they do not want\" she complained in a televised address that sought to reach over the heads of parliament to the British people and infuriated lawmakers on both sides of the House of Commons. \"I passionately hope MPs will find a way to back the deal I\\'ve negotiated with the EU a deal that delivers on the result of the referendum and is the very best deal negotiable\" she said. The deal could be brought back to parliament as early as Tuesday. May wrote to EU Council president and summit host Donald Tusk on Wednesday to ask for a three-month delay of Brexit until June 30. But EU diplomats said the consensus was that Britain would either have to leave before the May 23 European election or take part in the vote and stay in the bloc until at least the end of the year. \"Reports that most are for a short extension up to the elections are not wrong\" an European diplomat said as the leaders gathered in the city. \"A large majority assembled around May 22 to 23 because it is the cleanest (option) legally.\" Another diplomat said that the May date was not set in stone but that \"a majority of member states said \\'no\\' to June 30.\" Any delay to Brexit day would need to be approved unanimously. May has insisted that she will not oversee a long delay which would increase pressure at home for a general election or for a second Brexit referendum that might reverse the decision to leave. \"You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with this. I agree. I am on your side\" May told voters blaming MPs opposed to her Brexit plan. She insisted she was requesting a delay until June 30 with \"great personal regret\". \\'Brexit fatigue\\' Tusk meanwhile admitted that European leaders are suffering \"Brexit fatigue\". He said he feared his hopes for an orderly Brexit agreement with the agreed plan in place to prevent economic and political chaos may prove \"frail even illusory.\" British lawmakers have twice resoundingly rejected May\\'s agreement and a third vote the premier hoped to hold this week was cancelled by the House of Commons speaker on procedural grounds. Nevertheless Tusk was clear that Europe wants May to try again. \"In the light of the consultations I have conducted over the past days I believe a short extension will be possible but it will be conditional on a positive vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons\" Tusk told reporters. May is hoping a third vote could be admitted despite the speaker\\'s decision if she can formalise some guarantees that EU officials attached to the agreement last week. The British parliament has been deadlocked for months over Brexit with MPs unable to decide how to implement the referendum result and voters themselves are also sharply divided. Britain faces the potentially catastrophic prospect of leaving its biggest trading partner with no arrangements in place. May\\'s team tried to engage senior members of the opposition hoping to bring enough members on side to pull her deal through. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will also be in Brussels on Thursday for talks with EU negotiator Michel Barnier. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British MPs on Wednesday begin five days of debate ahead of a historic delayed vote on Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit deal a day after giving her a stinging blow aimed at preventing the country from crashing out of the EU with no agreement. May\\'s attempts to win over MPs from Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which props up her government in parliament but is firmly opposed to the Brexit deal were also rebuffed on Wednesday. The government said it would grant local lawmakers in Northern Ireland greater powers to block legislation if their province ever found itself in a contentious \"backstop\" arrangement to avoid a hard border in Ireland. But DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson told Sky News that the proposals were \"window dressing\" and that there would still have to be checks between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain in the event the backstop is enacted. May faced another possible setback later on Wednesday as rebel Conservative MPs pushed for a vote that would force the government to reveal its plans within three days if the Brexit deal is not approved next Tuesday. Lawmakers next week will be voting on the agreement that May has negotiated with the EU over the last 18 months which faces daunting opposition as the clock ticks down before Britain leaves the European Union on March 29. The prime minister has warned rebels in her own party that defeat will lead to a no-deal Brexit or no departure from the bloc at all. But in a vote on Tuesday that raised the chances of a defeat in next week\\'s historic vote MPs including former ministers approved an amendment that will curtail the government\\'s tax powers in case of a no-deal Brexit. Brexit \\'fantasies\\' David Lidington May\\'s effective deputy called the House of Commons defeat \"inconvenient\" yet ineffectual and insisted the government remained focused on winning approval for the prime minister\\'s plan. \"We are focused on getting any possible vote in favour of the PM\\'s deal\" he told BBC radio.\\xa0 \"I don\\'t think the British public are served by fantasies about magical alternative deals.\\xa0 \"The choice the people have is this deal or no deal or - as some MPs advocate - to reverse the 2016 referendum entirely.\" The prime minister has already pulled the vote once with defeat looming and has said a loss for the government would plunge Britain into \"uncharted territory\". She is still seeking assurances from the EU on the most controversial elements of the Brexit deal relating to Northern Ireland in a bid to convince critics to back the agreement. These assurances are set to be delivered to lawmakers before they vote although not before they start their debate on Wednesday. \"The work to secure those assurances is ongoing. I think what\\'s important is that if we are to secure assurances MPs are aware of what they are before the vote takes place\" a Downing Street spokesman said Tuesday. Brexit delayed? Some MPs would be in favour of a second referendum but such a move would likely cause outrage among Brexit voters and raise the issue of the framing of the question. The battle has reached fever pitch as the deadline looms with second referendum campaigners setting up stalls at markets nationwide and Brexiteers touring the country to persuade Britons they have nothing to fear from a clean break. May insists Britain will leave the EU in March whatever happens but there is growing talk of delaying the two-year Article 50 exit process to give her some breathing space to get her deal agreed. An EU diplomat told AFP on Tuesday that \"we are convinced that Theresa May will request a postponement after the agreement is rejected in the British parliament.\" Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay denied reports about a possible delay saying \"there are people in the European Union who are discussing this issue but that is not the position of the UK government.\" The prime minister survived a half-hearted attempt by her party to oust her before Christmas but the level of rebellion has left her weakened. The main opposition Labour Party on Wednesday confirmed it will seek a no confidence vote in the government if MPs reject May\\'s Brexit deal next week. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Dylan Martinez/Reuters  Britain is expected to choose a new central bank chief this year to succeed Canadian Mark Carney who will step down in June 2019 three months after the country’s scheduled exit from the European Union. Following is a summary of possible contenders to run the Bank of England (BoE) which oversees the world’s sixth-biggest economy and Britain’s huge finance industry. No one has yet thrown their hat into the ring. Widely tipped by analysts as Carney’s most likely successor Andrew Bailey reached the role of deputy governor of the BoE with a focus on banks before becoming chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority a financial markets regulator. During his time at the BoE Bailey helped to steer Britain’s banks through the global financial crisis enhancing his reputation as a safe pair of hands. However heading the FCA – which roots out misconduct in Britain’s large financial services sector – is fraught with risks. The head of the British parliament’s influential Treasury Committee has criticised Bailey for withholding parts of a report into alleged misconduct by state-owned RBS during the financial crisis. Bailey has cited privacy restrictions. As FCA boss Bailey sits on important panels at the BoE that oversee banks. Although he has never been interest-rate setter he once ran the BoE international economic analysis team. Bailey acknowledged the speculation about a move to the BoE in an interview published this week. “You’ll be unsurprised to know this question comes up reasonably often” Bailey told Financial News. “But I’ve got a job and I have to be honest with you I have never spent my time thinking about the one I want to do next.” Ben Broadbent and Dave Ramsden are deputy governors for monetary policy and for markets and banking respectively burnishing their credentials as potential successors to Carney. Broadbent a former Goldman Sachs economist who once trained as a classical pianist is respected for his economic analysis but has less experience on banking oversight which has become an important part of the BoE governor’s role. Ramsden only joined the central bank in September although he is no stranger to the Monetary Policy Committee having attended 92 of its meetings in his previous role as the Treasury’s chief economic adviser. The two other BoE deputy governors Jon Cunliffe and Sam Woods are less likely contenders. Woods focuses mostly on bank regulation while Cunliffe – a former British ambassador to the EU – would be aged 66 at the start of the term which usually runs for eight years although Carney has chosen to step down after six. The BoE’s chief economist Andy Haldane has developed a reputation for floating unconventional ideas including the abolition of cash as a way to give central banks more muscle over the economies they run. In 2012 he praised the anti-capitalist Occupy movement for suggesting new ways to fix the shortcomings of global finance. Haldane has experience of both sides of the bank having served previously as executive director for financial stability overseeing the risks to the economy from the banking system. But he might be seen as too much of a maverick to take the job of governor. The announcement of Carney the first non-British governor of the BoE in more than three centuries was a surprise. Should Finance Minister Philip Hammond also opt for a less obvious candidate one name that has appeared in Britain’s media is that of Sharon White the head of a telecoms regulator and who previously worked at the Treasury. The daughter of Jamaican immigrants she has won wide praise for her high-profile roles in the public sector. Another outside contender would be Adair Turner a former chairman of a now defunct financial services regulator who was in the running last time around. He continues to speak about the British economy and has warned of the risks from high debt levels. The prospect of the left-wing Labour Party taking power in the next year or so is remote but investors are mindful that Prime Minister Theresa May has only a small majority in Parliament after last year’s failed election gamble and her Conservative Party is split over how to leave the EU. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his would-be finance minister John McDonnell are socialists and have in the past proposed that the BoE should fund investment in infrastructure a big change from its current focus on inflation. If they were to pick the next BoE governor Ben Seager-Scott chief investment strategist at Tilney Group an investment firm said they might consider former members of an economic advisory committee which included US academic and Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz and Ann Pettifor a British economist who is an austerity critic. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The EU once the UK leaves or crashes out of the Union will have its hands free of la Perfide Albion to move ahead with full integration of the eurozone or of the willing Member States. This will leave behind several countries including Malta not willing to show solidarity or to share common foreign fiscal economic defence and social policies but it will strengthen those that join in all world bodies. It will strengthen Europe’s voice in foreign trade squabbles with the US and China. The EU will improve its independent defences against Russia slowly weaning itself away from the US which until recently very loyal in its shared values is drifting apart from Europe in its values and interests. This is a pity since most Americans are fundamentally very close to European ideals and values. However the control of the US by strong economic lobbies from Saudi Arabia Israel Wall Street religious and white supremacist and gun lobby groups has produced Trumpism. Europe needs to react to these changes and the departure of the UK will be the catalyst for this. I am truly confident that as in 1957 with the creation of the European project out of the shambles and destruction of two world wars we can recreate the European project leading to the formation in due course of the United States of Europe. The UK will also go through momentous change as it crashes out of the EU. I am convinced that it will not resolve the Irish border issue. Two routes are open. The first would be to hold a new referendum which will strongly vote to remain within the EU now that all have understood how a small vociferous section of the Tory Party backed by the votes of the majority of elderly small Englanders who harp constantly about the glorious days of Queen Victoria steamrolled over the younger generation. They fell for the myths and well-oiled campaign of lies presented by the likes of fascist Nigel Farage and clownish Boris Johnson. We can recreate the European project leading to the formation in due course of the United States of Europe The referendum will not be allowed by the present Prime Minister so that route is barred. The other route that would stop the crash would be the rapid evolution of the changes taking place in Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which still backs the London regime of occupation of the North has begun to sense that their days are numbered. This is because the majority of Irish voters in Northern Ireland would rather leave the UK and join Ireland – and in this way stay in the EU. If the DUP withdraw their vote Theresa May’s government will fall and in the ensuing confusion Scotland and Northern Ireland will move ahead with their independence. This would solve the exit of England and Wales from the EU while leaving Scotland and Ireland within the bloc. That would be the best result of the referendum for all concerned. It is the will of England and Wales to leave the EU since majorities in both these parts of the UK in the referendum signalled their willingness. It will also give those occupied areas of the UK which voted to remain in the EU a chance to break away from the centralised power of London and Westminster. Since London has for a long time been a centre for money laundering tax evasion and so-called fintech industries it can make itself a declared tax haven and probably succeed economically. Has Malta not managed to do well economically by becoming a money laundering and tax evasion centre in the last 15 years? London with so much more experience and free from the shackles of the EU will also succeed. Colonialism is wrong and will remain so whether through occupation of land and extortion of national re\\xadsources or through economic extortion of the poorer segments of populations by the oligarchies of economic power. The sooner colonialism comes to an end through democratic controls through rules governing transparency accountability and fair distribution of wealth the better. The former form of colonialism through occupation of land like Crimea by Russia Gaza by Israel Scotland and Northern Ireland by England Kurdistan by Turkey and others will come to an end probably within our lifetime. The other and more subtle form of colonialism – the economic colonialism as expressed by Trumpism by Malta’s oligarchy of developers and corrupt politicians by tax havens and passport selling countries blacklisted by the OECD – will take longer to come to grips with. The power of greed across the world is extremely strong. The bait placed on hooks before voters’ mouths by corrupt politicians whether in the shape of nationalism xenophobia GDP growth patronage threats to journalists and whistle-blowers murders of dissidents and so forth are too attractive or frightening for the masses to revolt against. The risk of a global revolt by the downtrodden is growing day by day. Guido de Marco used to say that the Middle East was like a bomb with an ever-shortening fuse. This analogy fits also for colonialism in whatever form it expresses itself. John Vassallo is a former Ambassador of Malta to the EU.

Photo: Chris Sant Fournier  Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has suggested the UK might change its mind about Brexit. In an interview with Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant Dr Muscat said that he sensed doubts about the decision to quit the EU beginning to creep in. “For the first time I’m starting to believe that Brexit will not happen. I am seeing hopeful signs that indicate things will change. I see encouraging signs that the tide is turning. I’m not saying the Brits have made a mistake but the mood is changing” he said.\\xa0 Dr Muscat acknowledged that the UK had voted to leave the EU but said that the referendum result had created a situation \"in which everyone loses\" and said history was full of examples when the people\\'s will had \"disastrous consequences.\". \"It would be good if a political leader in the UK stands up and is courageous enough to address this new situation. Someone who says: let’s put the Brexit end-deal to a popular vote” the Prime Minister said.\\xa0 UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said that the final Brexit deal which must be agreed upon by the end of March 2019 would be put to a parliamentary vote. Brexit negotiations began last month and progress so far appears halting with the two sides expressing very different views as to how the UK should withdraw from the EU.\\xa0 While the UK is keen to negotiate both its exit and subsequent agreements concurrently European leaders have been clear that the UK must quit the bloc before talks about future relations can take place.\\xa0 The perception that UK negotiators are ill-prepared for the talks have added to scepticism that talks will falter. But in his interview Dr Muscat said critics had the wrong end of the stick. \"The problem isn’t that London is prepared badly but that the EU is prepared extremely well\" Dr Muscat told the Dutch newspaper. \"That much became clear when Michael Barnier asked me ‘Do you know how many cats and dogs travel from Dover to Calais every year? Do you know what’s to be done with the animal passport?’ Such detail! “That’s when I knew: the EU is excellently prepared.\" \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Just six months before Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29 2019 Prime Minister Theresa May has said talks to clinch a divorce deal are at an impasse. She has said her \"Chequers\" proposals are the only viable option but EU leaders have said key parts of them are unacceptable and many lawmakers in her own Conservative Party have threatened to vote down a deal based on May\\'s blueprint. The uncertainty has led to concerns that Britain will leave without a deal which businesses particularly carmakers have said would be hugely damaging. \"Of course we want a deal\" Business Secretary Greg Clark told BBC radio. \"No one should be under any illusion that the prime minister and our negotiating team are absolutely determined... \"There are grounds for optimism that we can reach an agreement on this\" he said. Clark was responding to comments from the boss of Toyota\\'s plant in central England who told the BBC a no-deal Brexit would hit production. It is the latest in a series of warnings from carmakers that any delays at borders could slow the movement of components and finished models adding costs and crippling output. \"If we crash out of the EU at the end of March the supply chain will be impacted and we will see production stops in our factory\" said Marvin Cooke managing director of Toyota\\'s Burnaston plant which produced 144000 models last year. Earlier this week other carmakers in Britain including BMW McLaren and Honda said they had triggered some Brexit contingency plans such as certifying models in the EU and were working on redrawing production schedules and stockpiling more parts. The moves aim to ensuring plants which rely on the just-in-time delivery of tens of thousands of components can keep operating after Brexit but will add costs and bureaucracy which could risk their long-term viability. Jaguar Land Rover Britain\\'s biggest carmaker has warned it does not know whether its plants will be able to operate in six months\\' time and that the wrong Brexit deal could cost thousands of car jobs. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 2nd 07:07  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain may need to delay Brexit to pass legislation to implement the split with the European Union Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Thursday. MPs are also cancelling a planned holiday next month to allow time to pass key legislation ahead of the scheduled date for Brexit on March 29. \"The fact that recess won\\'t be taking place and MPs will be sitting shows you that we are taking all available steps to make sure that March 29 is our exit date\" a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said. As the March 29 withdrawal date looms the government is still trying to convince MPs to support a version of the divorce deal it has agreed with the bloc. Even if it is passed legislation putting the treaty into effect would then have to go through both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. \"If we ended up approving a deal in the days before March 29 then we might need some extra time to pass critical legislation\" Hunt told BBC radio. \"But if we are able to make progress sooner then that might not be necessary. We can\\'t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.\" The government is considering extending parliamentary hours and cancelling the February holiday of MPs to allow more time to debate Brexit legislation. But there are still eight laws needed to prepare for Brexit not just on the deal but also covering issues such as trade agriculture and immigration. Andrea Leadsom the leader of the House of Commons had previously suggested Britain could probably secure \"a couple of extra weeks\" if needed. Any delay must be agreed by the other 27 EU countries. Prime Minister Theresa May has promised to return to Brussels to try to secure changes to the deal that would enable MPs to support it but the EU has warned it does not want to reopen the agreement. Without the deal Britain runs the risk of severing ties with its closest trading partner on March 29 with no new arrangements in place. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The chairman of the EESC’s Brexit Group Stefano Mallia has urged Michel Barnier the EU’s chief negotiator on Brexit to make “one last effort” for a successful Brexit which would see the UK leave the EU in an orderly fashion. The Maltese representative said a hard Brexit would be negative for everyone not just the UK but also the EU. “Unfortunately every day that passes brings us closer to this unwanted scenario” he said. Mr Mallia stressed during the EESC plenary that as from the first day following Brexit day the UK would become a ‘third country’.\\xa0We don\\'t want to use the backstop. It\\'s comparable to your house insurance – you pay it but you wish not to have to use it “We have 40 years of relations and we cannot just throw away such a treasure. With this in mind the EESC is calling on you and the Commission to set up a formal joint consultative commission that will provide for a structured social dialogue between the civil society partners of the EU and this of the UK”. Mr Barnier stressed that there was no hostility or punishment regarding the negotiations but that his responsibility was to solve the problems for the EU. \"We don\\'t want to use the backstop. It\\'s comparable to your house insurance – you pay it but you wish not to have to use it\" he said. Mr Barnier stressed that the backstop was not about trade and goods but about people who needed security. He added that the border in Ireland was not something that only affected the UK and Northern Ireland as it was the border of the 27 countries in the single market. “Goods coming from Northern Ireland go to all European countries. This therefore makes it a European question” Mr Barnier said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Three members of Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s cabinet warned Saturday that Brexit must be delayed if she cannot persuade the British parliament to back her EU divorce deal next week. Business minister Greg Clark work and pensions minister Amber Rudd and justice minister David Gauke wrote an article stating their opposition to leaving the European Union on March 29 with no deal. May is currently scrambling to secure changes to the divorce text she struck with the bloc in November hoping to win the support of MPs who last month rejected the deal by a massive margin. \"If there is no breakthrough in the coming week the balance of opinion in parliament is clear - that it would be better to seek to... delay our date of departure rather than crash out of the European Union on March 29\" the ministers wrote in the Daily Mail newspaper. They added: \"Beyond the next few days there simply will not be time to agree a deal and complete all the necessary legislation before March 29.\" But they warned that leaving the EU with no deal would \"severely\" damage the economy weaken national security and risk the break-up of the UK. May was in Brussels this week for talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and will meet European Council president Donald Tusk on Sunday at an EU-Arab League summit in Egypt. She has promised to update parliament on her efforts on Tuesday and either put the new deal to a fresh vote of MPs or allow them on Wednesday to debate their own ideas for the way forward. One of these is expected to be a plan to delay Brexit to avoid a \"no deal\" scenario. The ministers warned their hardline Brexit-supporting colleagues who continue to oppose May\\'s Brexit deal that MPs will not allow Britain to leave the EU with no deal by default. \"If that happens they (the eurosceptics) will have no-one to blame but themselves for delaying Brexit\" they said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May on Saturday vowed to speak to every EU member state leader \"over the coming days\" as she wrote to Conservative MPs to appeal for unity over Brexit. In the letter to her fractious colleagues excerpts of which were released by Downing Street late Saturday May urged the party to \"move beyond what divides us\". The embattled British leader said ruling Tories need to sacrifice \"personal preferences\" for the \"higher service of the national interest\".\\xa0 The plea came after May this week suffered another parliamentary defeat over Brexit suggesting a shortlived period of party unity over reforming her draft EU divorce deal may not survive. \\xa0 On Thursday night MPs rejected a motion expressing support for May\\'s efforts to seek changes to her under-fire agreement after members of her own Conservative party abstained. In her letter to lawmakers Saturday the prime minister called the vote \"disappointing\" but insisted she would keep seeking to secure changes to the so-called backstop arrangement in the deal. Her office revealed she planned \"to speak to the leader of every EU member state in the coming days\". \"I do not underestimate how deeply or how sincerely colleagues hold the views which they do on this important issue\" May told Tories referring to Brexit. \"But I believe that a failure to make the compromises necessary... will let down the people who sent us to represent them\" she warned. \"Our party can do what it has done so often in the past: move beyond what divides us and come together behind what unites us.\" May confirmed she would return to Brussels next week for further talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay will on Monday meet EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier to discuss proposals put forward by a new \"working group\" of British lawmakers exploring alternatives to the backstop according to her office. Meanwhile Attorney General Geoffrey Cox will on Tuesday make a speech \"setting out what changes would be required to eliminate the legal risk we could be trapped in backstop indefinitely\" Downing Street said. Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29 but its parliament last month rejected a draft divorce deal May negotiated with the bloc prompting fears the country could crash out without a deal next month. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit strategy means disaster for Britain her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said as critics at home and officials in Brussels stepped up their opposition to her plans for how to leave the European Union. With under two months before Britain and the EU want to agree a deal to end over 40 years of union May is struggling to sell what she calls her business-friendly Brexit to her own party and across a divided country.\\xa0In adopting the Chequers proposals we have gone into battle with the white flag fluttering over our leading tank May\\'s former deputy Damian Green described her government as \"walking a narrow path with people chucking rocks from both sides\" after Johnson a potential successor to May and other Conservative lawmakers attacked the so-called Chequers plan. \"In adopting the Chequers proposals we have gone into battle with the white flag fluttering over our leading tank. If we continue on this basis we will throw away most of the advantages of Brexit\" Johnson wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper on Monday. \"People can see Chequers means disaster.\" The plan named for the prime minister\\'s country residence where it was agreed by the cabinet in July calls for free trade between Britain and the EU in manufactured and agricultural goods with Britain accepting regulations over traded goods that align with EU rules. The government says it is the only way to achieve Brexit without harming the economy. But opponents on both sides of the Brexit debate have criticised it for offering either too sharp a rupture with the EU or a break that is not clean enough. Johnson one of the leading pro-Brexit campaigners during the referendum that secured Britain\\'s 2016 vote to leave quit May\\'s cabinet days after the Chequers plan was approved. \"We will remain in the EU taxi; but this time locked in the boot with absolutely no say on the destination\" he wrote in Monday\\'s column criticising the plan for regulatory alignment. May\\'s spokesman said the Chequers proposals were the only credible and negotiable plan for Brexit and the government believed the plan could carry the support of parliament. \"There\\'s no new ideas in this article to respond to. What we need at this time is serious leadership with a serious plan and that is exactly what the country has with this Prime Minister and this Brexit plan\" the spokesman told reporters. The Times newspaper reported 20 Conservative lawmakers were now backing a grassroots \\'StandUp4Brexit\\' campaign committing to opposing the Chequers plan. Parliament returns from its summer break on Tuesday. May has a working majority of just 13 votes and has pledged to give lawmakers approval of the final deal with Brussels. Losing such a vote could see Britain leave the EU without a deal and possibly force an early election. Conservative lawmaker and former government minister Nick Boles who backed remaining in the EU during the referendum and now wants to stay in the single market on an interim basis while negotiating a \"Better Brexit\" free trade deal said he didn\\'t think May had enough support for her proposals. Asked during an interview on BBC Radio what the chances were of getting her proposals through parliament he said: \"Very very small as close to zero as anything in politics.\" British media have reported Brexit-supporting Conservative lawmakers are preparing to unveil an alternative plan before the party\\'s annual conference at the end of the month.

Then all sorts of other third countries could insist that we offer them the same benefits.

British Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday survived a no-confidence vote sparked by the crushing defeat of her Brexit deal just weeks before the UK leaves the European Union. A stunning 24-hour span saw May on Tuesday dealt the heaviest drubbing by parliament in modern British political history -- 432 votes to 202 -- over the divorce terms she reached with Brussels. She emerged victorious in parliament\\'s first no-confidence vote in a British government in 26 years on Wednesday by a 325-306 margin a majority of 19. But it may have only been a pyrrhic victory for the hobbled but determined premier as she tries to steer the world\\'s fifth-biggest economy through its biggest crisis in a generation. The opposition Labour Party could try to oust her government again in the hope of triggering snap elections before Britain\\'s scheduled March 29 Brexit date. And May herself is working on the tightest-possible deadline as Britain prepares to leave the bloc that for half a century defined its economic and political relations with the rest of the world. She has promised to return to parliament on Monday with an alternative Brexit strategy devised through cross-party talks with the opposition. There is now an assumption among many European diplomats that Brexit will have to be delayed to avoid a potentially catastrophic \"no-deal\" breakup. May notably refused to rule out the idea when quizzed about it in parliament earlier on Wednesday. May survived Wednesday thanks to the support of members of her Conservative Party and ruling coalition Northern Irish allies in the Democratic Union Party. But more than a third of the Conservatives and all 10 DUP members of parliament voted against her Brexit arrangements on Tuesday -- each for their own reason. \\'Zombie government\\' Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn opened Wednesday\\'s debate by telling May she was leading a \"zombie government\" whose Brexit agreement was \"officially dead\". May must \"do the right thing and resign\" said Corbyn. But there is still no consensus in parliament on how to proceed and May called an election \"the worst thing we could do\". \"It would deepen division when we need unity it would bring chaos when we need certainty and it would bring delay when we need to move forward\" May argued. May offers immediate talks with party leaders \\xa0Immediately after Wednesday\\'s vote Mrs May said she was inviting the leaders of the parliamentary parties for talks immediately tonight on the Brexit process.\\xa0  Mr Corbyn replied that before any meaningful discussions the government needed to remove the prospect of a no deal Brexit. The Liberal Democrats argued in the same manner. May will thus tread carefully as she tries to win over opposition lawmakers -- many of whom want to remain in the EU -- while also attempting to appease more hardened Brexit-backing coalition partners. During a grilling in parliament earlier on Wednesday May repeated two key principles -- limiting migration and pursuing an independent trade policy -- which would rule out Labour hopes of membership of an EU customs union or its single market. But she also hinted at the possibility of delaying Brexit. May said the EU would allow this \"if it was clear that there was a plan towards moving towards an agreed deal\". All 27 EU leaders would have to sign off a Brexit date postponement in case May requests one -- something she has until now refused to do. EU officials have said extending the negotiating period could be possible until the newly-elected European Parliament meets in June. Blurred linesEU leaders have repeatedly said they will not reopen the draft withdrawal agreement sealed at a special Brussels summit in December. French President Emmanuel Macron suggested after May\\'s fiasco on Tuesday that the EU might be willing to tweak a few minor points -- but only if they did not alter the bloc\\'s existing position on trade and borders. \"Maybe we’ll make improvements on one or two things but I don’t really think so because we’ve reached the maximum of what we could do with the deal\" the French leader said. \"We won\\'t just to solve Britain\\'s domestic political issues stop defending European interests.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel added: \"We still have time to negotiate but we\\'re now waiting on what the prime minister proposes.\"\\xa0 And Irish Prime Leo Varadkar added \"that if the United Kingdom were to evolve from its red lines on the customs union and on the single market that the European Union could evolve also.\"\\xa0  \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Just 24 hours after suffering a historic defeat in parliament over her Brexit deal the prime minister has survived a vote of no confidence in her government – thanks to the support of her backbench MPs. Up until this point these same backbench MPs have been all too willing to vote against her and her Brexit deal. The result was expected given that a Conservative rebellion would have likely resulted in a general election that might have gone very badly for the party. Ousting the prime minister is less appealing when instead of offering the potential for career advancement there is a strong chance that it would instead lead to a demotion to the shadow cabinet. With the very public plotting and scheming that has been displayed over Brexit it is little wonder that British people have become profoundly mistrustful of their elected representatives and their motivations. What happens next is therefore crucial not only for the prime minister and the country but also the public’s faith in the nation’s democracy. The way forward is not clear and many in the EU would like to know just what it is the UK actually wants. In an attempt to find out May has promised to consult with leading parliamentarians over the way forward. She has been criticised for not doing this sooner and while it could perhaps throw up a fresh idea to move things forward it is hard to see what assurances the prime minister or the European Union can give that would placate anyone. Realistically speaking the only way to get the major changes on the controversial issues would be to re-open Brexit negotiations with the European Union and extend the article 50 period. While there is some support for the latter the former has not been an acceptable option on the continent for some time now. That doesn’t appear likely to change. Many prominent hard Brexit supporters have suggested that parliament’s dismissal of the deal will put the EU under pressure. They think Brussels will come back to the negotiating table once the screws are turned. But as things stand this looks like misplaced bravado and even wishful thinking. To suggest that the defeat of the deal in parliament will somehow force the EU to waver is a perfect display of the flawed logic that created this situation in the first place. While the prospect of a no-deal Brexit is of course concerning to them the remaining EU member states are prepared to weather the storm of a no-deal if they must. They would rather not have to but if it is a choice between that or threatening the integrity of the single market and the European project itself the choice is clear – and has been since before article 50 was even triggered. Ultimately if a new deal is well and truly off the table there are a limited set of options the government can pursue. Brexit could be cancelled or it could be put to another referendum. Neither are likely to be popular options within the Conservative Party. More likely it has been suggested that the government may keep making parliament vote on the deal or some version of it until it passes although the legality of this is now in question. If the deal cannot get through the Commons there may be no other option but to leave without a deal. Conservative MPs therefore need to either get behind the deal or resign themselves to endorsing a no-deal scenario. It is also decision time for Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party. Having failed to win the vote of no confidence and force their preferred option of a general election they too have to either get behind the deal or consign the country to a no-deal scenario. That said there is of course the ever-controversial option of a second referendum. Corbyn has resisted calls for this so far – but with mounting pressure from MPs and the membership as well as a desperate need for some distinctiveness on Brexit between the two major parties it may prove hard to keep voting down the prime minister’s deal without offering a viable alternative. Having successfully showed their desire and ability to assert themselves in the Brexit process in parliament the MPs themselves may be the key to ending the deadlock. There is the looming threat that they will seize complete control of the issue legislating to prevent a no-deal scenario from even being possible. Given the historic defeat over the Brexit deal it is not implausible that such a move could get the support it needs. However if the EU refuses to budge on the deal or the timing of Brexit it is again hard to see where this would ultimately lead. Despite claims that Brexit would allow the UK to “take back control” it still seems that it is the European Union that is very much in charge of the situation.

Finance leaders of the Group of Seven industrial powers united over the weekend in wishing that Britain stays in the European Union but acknowledged they could do little more than hope. \"The G7 did not talk about a Plan B to respond to what would happen if Britain left the European Union\" French Finance Minister Michel Sapin told Reuters on Saturday. \"We talked about ways to help Britain stay in the EU.\" Britain\\'s momentous referendum on whether to stay in the EU has been a prime issue for global markets and policymakers who can largely only wait and see what Britons will say at the polls on June 23. The ups and downs of polling data have swayed financial markets for months. Concern over the looming vote is a major risk for the Federal Reserve which has indicated it may raise U.S. interest rates at its mid-June meeting but expressed concern about a \"Brexit.\" Sapin did not elaborate on any steps the G7 discussed to keep Britain in the EU during an interview on the sidelines of their meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in Sendai northeast Japan. It would be bad for Britain and bad for Europe because investors would have doubts and this would affect capital flows \"A Brexit would have heavy consequences\" Sapin said. \"It would be bad for Britain and bad for Europe because investors would have doubts and this would affect capital flows.\" But G7 ministers were able to do little but rally around Prime Minister David Cameron\\'s call for the EU\\'s second-largest economy to remain in the union. \"We clearly are concerned collectively at the risk of Brexit and do believe that could potentially have some economic impacts\" Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau told Reuters in Sendai. But he added \"We haven\\'t spoken of specific measures that might be taken in that regard.\" German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said the G7 members \"agreed that (a Brexit) would be the wrong decision.\" Cameron\\'s aggressive campaign to woo a eurosceptic public to vote \"In\" appears to be working for now. The pound this week touched its highest level against the euro in three and a half months as polls showed EU support strong and rising. An Ipsos-MORI poll on Friday found 55 percent favoured remaining in the EU versus 37 percent wanting \"Out.\" Economic arguments appear to be having some pull on the British public as \"In\" proponents argue a Brexit would cause financial market turmoil and hurt the $2.9 trillion UK economy. A vote to leave would hammer British house prices by 10-18 percent sending mortgage rates higher and hurting Britons trying to get onto the property ladder finance minister George Osborne told the BBC on Friday. Still the topic can be delicate for politicians from other countries as their comments could be counterproductive if they are seen in Britain as meddling. The G7\\'s Japanese host Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Friday that some of his counterparts supported a British exit - a remark quickly retracted by his staff. \"What the minister meant was that it would be good if Britain remained in the EU\" a Finance Ministry official said. President Barack Obama stirred debate in April when he warned on a visit that Britain would be \"in the back of the queue\" for a trade deal with the United States if it dropped out of the EU. Obama\\'s Treasury Secretary Jack Lew summarising the Sendai G7 meeting did not mention a Brexit. The European Commission has largely stayed out of the campaign. \"We have no Plan B for Brexit\" European Union Commissioner Pierre Moscovici told reporters in Sendai on Friday. \"Our only plan is for Britain to remain in a united Europe.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Matthew Mirabelli  Though the Office of the Prime Minister has welcomed in principle the Opposition’s offer to form a united front to deal with the Brexit challenges such a scenario still looks unlikely at least for the time being. Exactly a week ago Opposition leader Simon Busuttil extended “a hand of cooperation” to the government saying he would offer the PN’s “significant experience” in EU matters to get the best outcome for Malta.  The PN leader made the offer in his first reaction to the June 23 vote in which the British electorate opted to terminate the UK’s EU membership after 43 years. Dr Busuttil’s remarks had raised hopes that the two major parties might for once put their differences aside on EU matters so as to mitigate the backlash on crucial economic sectors like tourism from the UK. Earlier Prime Minister Joseph Muscat had allayed such concerns saying that Malta was fully-geared for the Brexit scenario as for several weeks government had been running models and “simulations” of the possible implications that such outcome could have on the island. Asked by the Times of Malta if the government was ready to engage with the Opposition on the Brexit issue a Prime Minister’s spokesman last Saturday welcomed the PN’s offer but at the same time raised doubts. “While the government welcomes and works with anybody who is ready to pull the same rope in the national interest in the prevailing circumstances including the Opposition it would be much wiser for the Opposition leader and his party to refrain from talking down the country abroad at every opportunity” the OPM spokesman said. PN leader Simon Busuttil has said his party has the experience and credibility needed to negotiate at EU level. He added that political parties should always act responsibly and not just in times of difficulty for the country. The spokesman however was not very forthcoming when asked to present the details of the “simulations” referred to by Dr Muscat. While reiterating that each ministry had prepared its own studies and possible consequences of Brexit no further details were divulged. “The simulations show that while politically we will have challenges economically generally speaking there are opportunities” the OPM spokesman told this newspaper. On his part a Nationalist Party spokesman yesterday confirmed that the Opposition had not received any feedback from the government on Dr Busuttil’s offer at least by the time of writing. “Unfortunately six days after we made our offer the government has not only refrained from making any public comment on our offer but no approach has been made” the PN spokesman said. He noted that the Opposition was willing to help the Maltese government in the upcoming EU-UK bilateral talks which would pave the way for Britain’s exit from the EU. “With all modesty the Nationalist Party believes it has the expertise experience and credibility when it comes to negotiations at this level” the spokesman said. Reacting to the doubts raised by the OPM spokesperson the PN said that it had always been on the right side of history while accusing the PL of adopting populist tactics that had failed to live up to national interest. Dr Busuttil’s offer for close government cooperation was also echoed by former Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi in an opinion piece published on The Sunday Times of Malta. Dr Gonzi urged Dr Muscat to engage with the Opposition’s while expressing regret that the government was not utilising the PN’s “high level of experience and expertise” on EU matters. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s exit from the European Union could be delayed until at least late 2019 because the government was too \"chaotic\" to start the two-year process early next year the Sunday Times reported citing sources it said were briefed by ministers. Britain voted to leave the EU on June 23 but views differ over when it should invoke \"Article 50\" which sets the clock ticking on a two-year deadline to leave the bloc with some senior politicians calling for a quick departure. Prime Minister Theresa May who campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU and leads a cabinet of ministers from either side of the debate has said she will not trigger Brexit talks this year as Britain needs time to prepare. But British government ministers have warned senior figures in the City of London London\\'s financial district that Article 50 was unlikely to be triggered early in 2017 because the situation in government was \"chaotic\" the Sunday Times reported on Sunday. \"Ministers are now thinking the [Article 50] trigger could be delayed until autumn 2017\" one source who had spoken to two senior ministers told the newspaper. \"They don\\'t have the infrastructure for the people they need to hire. They say they don\\'t even know the right questions to ask when they finally begin bargaining with Europe.\" Asked about the reported delay to triggering Article 50 a Number 10 spokeswoman said: \"The Prime Minister has been clear that a top priority for this government is to deliver the decision of the British people to leave the EU and make a success of Brexit.\" \"The PM has set out the government\\'s position on Article 50 and has established a new department dedicated to taking forward the negotiations\" she said. European leaders have taken a firm line on the speed of Britain\\'s exit with German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying that while it was understandable that Britain would need a few months to figure out its strategy \"nobody wants a long period of limbo\". But behind the scenes there has been a growing realisation in Europe\\'s capitals that the two-year window for negotiating Brexit is far too short. Britain created two new government departments to handle Brexit and international trade led by David Davis and Liam Fox two prominent \"Leave\" campaigners in the referendum. Davis has recruited less than half of the 250 staff he needs for the Brexit department the Sunday Times said while Fox has fewer than 100 of the 1000 trade negotiators he is seeking. Elections in France in May and Germany in September could also push back the timing of Brexit. Any delay to the process however is likely to draw criticism from the pro-leave side of May\\'s Conservative party with senior members such as John Redwood calling for a quick departure from the bloc. There was an early sign of tension between the pro-Brexit members of May\\'s cabinet in a report that Fox had clashed with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson over the remit of his new department. Fox said economic diplomacy -- policies concerning trade and Britain\\'s economic ties -- should be transferred to his department according to a letter quoted in the Sunday Telegraph. Johnson had firmly rejected the Fox\\'s demands the newspaper said. The spokeswoman said the government did not comment on leaked documents. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Neil Hall/Reuters  Qatar pledged £5 billion of investment in Britain in a show of support for the world’s fifth-largest economy just days before Prime Minister Theresa May triggers formal Brexit talks. The wealthy Gulf state has £40 billion of investments in the United Kingdom including high-profile London landmarks like the Shard skyscraper Harrods department store The Savoy hotel and a stake in the Canary Wharf financial district. While the June 23 referendum vote to leave the European Union took many investors and chief executives by surprise Qatar’s top financial players used an investment conference in London to pledge support for Brexit Britain. The head of the $335 billion Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) sovereign wealth fund said he saw opportunities in Britain adding that the fund was focused on infrastructure healthcare and technology. “I am still looking even after Brexit there will be opportunities QIA can really hunt for” QIA chief executive Sheikh Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Saud al-Thani told the conference. “Whenever the (British) government would like the QIA to step in we are ready.” Qatar’s prime minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa al-Thani said in a statement that Qatar expected to invest £5 billion in Britain over the next five years. June’s shock Brexit vote triggered the deepest political crisis in Britain since World War Two and the biggest ever one-day fall in sterling against the dollar though the economy has continued to grow. But Britain’s exit from the EU – probably in 2019 – has raised a number of questions about future economic growth and whether London can retain its position as the only financial centre to challenge New York. Today PM Theresa May is due to notify the EU of Britain’s intention to leave the club it joined in 1973. Qatar which delivers 90 per cent of Britain’s imports of liquefied natural gas and is the world’s biggest producer of the fuel could play an important role in steeling the UK economy’s against economic fallout during and after Brexit. “The UK will have a new era post-Brexit ... The negotiations will start among Europeans and nobody is extremely clear about where the negotiations will lead to however we can sense the possibility of the UK’s manufacturing power going higher and with that the need for energy” Qatar’s Energy Minister Mohammed bin Saleh al-Sada told Reuters in an interview on Monday. “The UK’s manufacturing and industrial sector thriving is possible and for that Qatar will always be there to supply the energy required. Certainly we can contribute to the UK’s need” said Sada. Sada said Qatar supported a free-trade agreement which the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council including Qatar and the two biggest Arab economies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are hoping to secure ahead of Brexit to ensure preferential arrangements with Britain. “Qatar is supporting that. That would be excellent. Qatar will do its best to further this agreement” he said. Sovereign and private investors from Qatar Saudi Arabia Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been prolific buyers of British assets in the past decade snapping up billions of dollars worth of property mostly in London. Qatar has also sought to diversify its UK investments beyond real estate including buying stakes in retailer J Sainsbury Plc and London Heathrow airport. But Gulf states including Qatar are facing pressures of their own as they try to diversify their economies and boost non-oil trade after more than two years of low global oil prices that have hurt their finances. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Britain\\'s negotiations over leaving the European Union have not begun well due to disagreements among Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s team of ministers about the kind of deal they should be seeking a former top British diplomat said. Simon Fraser until 2015 the most senior civil servant at Britain\\'s Foreign Office and the head of the UK Diplomatic Service said the government needed to put forward a clearer position. There are differences within the cabinet about the sort of Brexit that we are heading for and until those differences are further resolved I think it\\'s very difficult for us to have a clear position Since May lost her parliamentary majority in a failed election gamble in June infighting between members of her cabinet has broken into the open with disagreements on issues including whether freedom of movement of EU nationals should continue after Britain leaves the bloc in 2019. \"The negotiations have only just begun I don\\'t think they have begun particularly promisingly frankly on the British side\" said Fraser who also formerly served as chief of staff to the European Trade Commissioner in Brussels. \"We haven\\'t put forward a lot because as we know there are differences within the cabinet about the sort of Brexit that we are heading for and until those differences are further resolved I think it\\'s very difficult for us to have a clear position\" he told BBC Radio. In the first full round of Brexit talks last month there was little compromise between British and EU chief negotiators on key disputes including how to protect the rights of expatriate citizens and on settling London\\'s EU \"divorce bill\". \"So far we haven\\'t put much on the table apart from something on the status of nationals so we are a bit absent from the formal negotiation\" said Fraser who now advises businesses on Brexit. An ORB opinion poll published on Monday showed that 61% of British voters disapprove of Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s handling of the Brexit negotiations \"We need to demonstrate that we are ready to engage on the substance so that people can understand what is really at stake here and what the options are so let\\'s move forward with that.\" Media reports say the government is due to publish a series of \"position papers\" later this week including its proposals on future customs arrangements with the EU and how to deal with the Northern Irish border. An ORB opinion poll published today showed that 61% of British voters disapprove of Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s handling of the Brexit negotiations. Britain has less than two years to negotiate the terms of the divorce and the outlines of the future relationship before it is due to leave in late March 2019. An August 2-3 opinion poll for ORB International showed 61% of British voters disapproved of the government\\'s handling of the Brexit negotiations up from 56% last month and 46% in June. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 8th 14:28  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Britain has ruled out staying in any customs union with the EU after Brexit Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said yesterday as the government prepares for a crunch week of Brexit talks. The extent of any British post-Brexit involvement in the EU’s customs union – which binds members into a trade bloc with common external tariffs – has become a major issue of contention inside May’s divided government and Conservative Party. Membership of the or a customs union after Brexit would prevent London from striking trade deals with countries outside the EU in future. “The key point as the\\u2008Prime Minister has said on many occasions is that we need to have our own independent trade policy and be able to strike trade deals with the rest of the world” May’s spokesman told reporters. “We will be leaving the EU and the customs union and it is not government policy to be members of ‘the’ customs union or ‘a’ customs union.” He said the official negotiating stance had been set out in a document published in August giving\\xa0 “two possible options and they are: a highly streamlined customs arrangement and a new customs partnership with the EU”. The spokesman said Britain was still looking at both options and no deadline for a decision on which one to pursue had been set. With just a year left before Britain’s March 2019 exit from the EU May’s party remains deeply divided over what sort of relationship should be built between the world’s biggest trading bloc and the world’s sixth-largest economy. Such are the divisions within May’s government that the debate over the extent of Britain’s post-Brexit participation in a EU customs union has taken place in public with key ministers offering a range of views. While May has repeatedly said that Britain will leave the customs union some ministers had hoped that Britain could remain in some sort of bespoke customs arrangement with the EU after Brexit. But supporters of Brexit say one of the main benefits of leaving the bloc will be the ability to strike trade deals with other faster-growing countries around the world. The Confederation of British Industry has called for Britain to stay in a customs union and Finance Minister Philip Hammond last month also left open the possibility of Britain joining a new customs union. A customs union means that its members apply the same tariff to goods imported into their territory from elsewhere and apply no tariffs to goods from other members. It also limits checks and other bureaucracies at borders between members. Unless Britain negotiates a new trade deal with the EU its exports would run into the union’s external tariffs which average about five per cent across all goods including 10 per cent for cars and over 200 per cent on certain types of poultry. But May is under pressure from eurosceptic members in her party to quit the trading arrangement because for them the key prize is a chance to sign new trade deals with other nations such as the US China and India. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The British pound has suffered its worst quarter since the vote to leave the European Union in June 2016 triggered one of the biggest selloffs in the currency\\'s history. Worries that Britain will run out of time to agree a deal with the European Union for life after Brexit a resurgent U.S. dollar and weakness in the economy have combined to hammer the pound which had started 2018 as one of the best performing major currencies. Sterling has slumped more than six percent since April to a 7-1/2 month low. That\\'s bigger than the 5.4 percent fall in the euro/dollar exchange rate and a 4.1 percent drop in the yen this quarter. Against the euro it has declined one percent. Hedge funds have a net short sterling position for the first time since November. That is in stark contrast to early 2018 when long positions were at their biggest in three years. The performance since April is also sterling\\'s second-worst quarter since the 2008 financial crisis. That matters because a strong pound is seen as a barometer of confidence in Britain\\'s economy. Sharp currency drops also risk raising inflation heaping pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates even if the economy is floundering. At present though the currency is being undermined further by economic weakness which has led the BoE to postpone rate hikes. Current bets for an August rise are about 60 percent but markets are not fully pricing in even one hike for 2018. Darkening the outlook further are uncertainties over the future trading relationship with the EU and hopes have receded that an EU summit that concludes on Friday would break a deadlock over Brexit issues such as the Irish border. \"At the start of the year the market was too optimistic on sterling\" said Rabobank strategist Jane Foley. \"We\\'ve had a dose of reality. Investors realise now there is a huge lack of clarity on the government\\'s plan for Brexit.\" Rabobank sees a strong chance of an August rate rise but has cut year-end exchange rate targets to $1.28 noting time was running out for a trade deal before Brexit happens next March. But others are less gloomy and some even predict the pound to recover towards $1.40 as interest rates rise. MUFG analysts also reckon an imminent UK government white paper outlining post-Brexit plans may offer sterling some respite. The pound has traded within tight ranges recently and volatility has fallen possibly because markets already price in the worst-case scenario -- \"hard Brexit\". But it may also indicate investors have stopped second-guessing outcomes preferring to sit on the sidelines until the prospect of a clean or disorderly Brexit becomes clear. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The co-founder of fashion brand Superdry is donating £1 million to the campaign for a referendum on the final Brexit agreement as Britain prepares to outline in more detail how a no-deal outcome would work. \"I\\'m putting some of my money behind the People\\'s Vote campaign because we have a genuine chance to turn this around\" said Julian Dunkerton a \"remainer\" who opposes Britain\\'s planned departure from the European Union. \"I’ve got a good instinct for when a mood is going to change and we’re in one of those moments now\" he said in comments reported by several British media outlets. Britons voted in a 2016 referendum to leave the EU but in July the proportion of voters who favour a referendum on the final terms of any Brexit deal overtook those who do not for the first time according to opinion polls. Britain\\'s Brexit minister Dominic Raab will travel to Brussels on Tuesday in a bid to pick up the pace of talks with the EU\\'s chief negotiator Michel Barnier Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s office said on Saturday. Britain will publish on Thursday the first of a series of technical notices designed to help people and businesses prepare for a no-deal scenario and Raab will give a speech outlining how the government plans to mitigate against any potential risks. \"Securing a deal is still by far the most likely outcome but we want to make sure that we clearly set out the steps that people businesses and public services need to take in the unlikely event that we don’t reach an agreement said Raab. Britain said it has been undertaking work on a no-deal scenario for almost two years with nearly £4 billion allocated by the finance ministry. London and Brussels hope to agree a Brexit deal at a summit in October but May faces splits within her party and the tough task of securing parliamentary approval for the final agreement as she tries to face down rebels. Campaigners on both sides of the argument have been stepping up their efforts in recent weeks as some Brexiteers argue against any agreement which keeps Britain tied to EU mechanisms such as the customs union or single market. On Saturday the former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party Nigel Farage said he would join a \"battle bus\" tour around the country by a pro-Brexit group which is opposed to May\\'s plans. The government is planning to recognise some EU regulations if London and Brussels fail to strike a deal taking a \"flexible\" approach to make sure medicines car parts and chemicals are still available The Sunday Telegraph reported. A spokesman at May\\'s Downing Street office did not offer an immediate comment on the report. But just days after a car hit pedestrians and police officers outside Britain\\'s parliament junior defence minister Tobias Ellwood said military and security cooperation should not be up for debate with the EU. \"Let the Brexit talks continue – but European security should be unconditional\" he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Last updated 7.25pm\\xa0\\xa0 The House of Commons on Thursday backed a UK government motion to seek an extension to the Brexit deadline after rejecting a call for the holding of a second referendum.\\xa0 The motion says the March 29 deadline for Britain to leave the EU should be extended to at least June 30 if the Commons approves a withdrawal agreement by next Wednesday. If the deal is not approved the government will negotiate the length of an extension with the EU. The vote was 412 in favour and 202 against. Earlier the House voted and defeated an amendment moved by Sarah Wollaston a former member of Theresa May\\'s Conservative Party seeking a second referendum on Brexit. 334 MPs voted against and only 85 in favour. The Labour opposition abstained but 25 rebel Labour MPs still voted in favour.\\xa0 The Labour Party and even the Campaign for a People\\'s Vote showed no enthusiasm to the referendum call saying this was not the right time for it. Prime Minister Theresa May has consistently rejected calls for a second referendum and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has also bee tepid to the idea. The Labour Party argued that Thursday\\'s Commons focus was only about seeking an extension to the Brexit deadline. Despite the Labour Party decision 25 rebel Labour MPs still took part in the vote and voted for a second referendum. The Labour Party decision to abstain was in the afternoon criticised by the small SNP party whose leader in the House Ian Blackford called Labour \\'a fraud\\'. \"MPs now have the chance to vote for a second referendum. Labour will be found out for what they are a fraud” he said. Plaid Cyrmu MP Jonathan Edwards also hit out at Labour. \"No amount of smoke grenades they use to justify this betrayal will survive the judgement of history. The vote is tonight - if Labour don\\'t support it will be to their eternal shame\" he said. But the People’s Vote Campaign in a statement also said this was not the time for MPs to vote for a second referendum.\\xa0 \"The People’s Vote campaign does not instruct its supporters in parliament on how to vote. We recognise there is a range of opinions on when to press the case for the public being given the final say which means some of these MPs will vote for the Wollaston amendment some may vote against and some will abstain. \"But we do not think today is the right time to test the will of the House on the case for a new public vote. Instead this is the time for parliament to declare it wants an extension of Article 50 so that after two-and-a-half years of vexed negotiations our political leaders can finally decide on what Brexit means. \"That is because a People’s Vote is not just another option in this Brexit crisis – it is a solution to this crisis. When the real costs of Brexit are measured up against the broken promises made for it in 2016 we believe Parliament will have better opportunities to decide it is only fair and reasonable to give the public a real say on this crucial decision for our country\" the Campaign said. Trump: second referendum would be unfair US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that holding a second referendum would be unfair. \"I don\\'t think another vote would be possible because it would be very unfair to people who have won\" Trump said at the White House. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Former British foreign secretary Boris Johnson on Saturday called for the government to appoint a minister to prepare for a \"no-deal\" British exit from the European Union in order to increase London\\'s leverage in talks with Brussels. He also called for Prime Minister Theresa May to withhold much of Britain\\'s exit payment to renegotiate its withdrawal deal and to dump the Northern Ireland backstop while avoiding triggering a no-deal Brexit. The withdrawal treaty\\'s \\'backstop\\' provision could ultimately align Northern Ireland more closely with the EU than the rest of the United Kingdom if no other way can be found to avoid a hard border with EU member the Republic of Ireland. The proposals received a rapturous reception from the audience at the annual conference of Northern Ireland\\'s pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party but Johnson did not explain how he would secure EU acquiescence to the plan. EU leaders have repeatedly said they are not willing to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and observers have suggested Britain would have to make major concessions elsewhere for it to be changed. May is due formally to agree the withdrawal deal with the EU\\'s remaining 27 members on Sunday. \"Unless we junk this backstop we will find that Brussels has got us exactly where they want us – a satellite state\" Johnson told the crowd. Britain he said risked \"economic and political humiliation.\" \"We need a secretary of state for no-deal or WTO (World Trade Organisation) terms with real powers across Whitehall (Britain\\'s civil service) to make things happen\" Johnson told the conference winning a standing ovation. \"I do not believe that we will exit without a deal – that is totally unnecessary – but it is only responsible of government to make the proper preparations.\" Johnson one of Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s fiercest critics since he quit her cabinet in July has not formally called for her ouster. But he is one of the leaders of a large group of Conservative members of parliament opposing May\\'s strategy and is regularly touted as a possible contender to replace her as Conservative Party leader should she fall over Brexit. May does not currently have enough support in the British parliament to ratify the deal. She has warned lawmakers they have a simple choice: back her deal or risk ushering in a no deal departure a delay to Brexit or possibly no Brexit at all. Speaking to the BBC Johnson said he did not believe a no-deal Brexit was likely but added: \"I don\\'t think it will be nearly as bad as some people suggest.\" Johnson who is known for his colourful language and at-time outlandish proposals repeated a call for the construction of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland a project that several experts have dismissed as impractical. \"We need urgently to recover our confidence and our self belief and to stop treating Brexit as if it were a plague of frogs or a murrain on our cattle or some adverse weather event that had to be managed\" he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

She said the UK would regain control over its borders but business would enjoy a free trade area with the EU. The UK would however leave the customs union. May insisted that she was not in favour of a second referendum and her government would deliver on the people\\'s vote to leave the EU. The government however would continue to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. \"We have been preparing for no-deal and we continue to prepare for no-deal because I recognise that we have a futher stage of negotiation with the European council and then that deal when finalised ... has to come back to this House\" she told parliament.\\xa0 May has already faced multiple ministerial resignations following the announcement of the agreement\\'s provisional terms but she insisted she can now move on to finalising the details of an\\xa0ambitious future partnership. The resignations included Dominic Raab who was responsible for the Brexit\\xa0negotiations\\xa0Brexit minister Esther McVey Work and Pensions Secretary Shailesh Vara\\xa0and junior Northern Ireland minister Suella Braverman.\\xa0 Speaking int he Commons Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn\\xa0said: \"The withdrawal agreement and the outline political declaration represent a huge and damaging failure ...

READ: Britain set to trigger Article 50 today Describing it as a \"key moment\" for the EU Commissioner Barnier spoke on the need to reach a \"fair agreement\" not only on the Brexit issue but also for the long-term future of the EU itself. On his part Dr Muscat reiterated his view that any fair deal had to nevertheless be inferior to membership. He said that once the process would be officially triggered Malta as EU Council president would be delivering the official Brexit negotiations guidelines to Commissioner Barnier within 48 hours. Dr Muscat pointed out that he did not envisage having 27 separate negotiations going on nor for the EU Council Presidency to hold separate talks. That responsibility will be shouldered byCommissioner Barnier alone on behalf of the EU he added. \"We will rely on your good judgment This is a sad day for the EU\" the Prime Minister said. On the other hand Dr Muscat expressed his confidence that the EU would move ahead. Asked for his reaction following the meeting Mr Barnier said that it had been “a very good meeting”. He also heaped praise on the Maltese EU Council Presidency. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

France has stepped up efforts to attract London banks to Paris after the election of President Emmanuel Macron who has cut taxes and taken steps to make labour laws more flexible. France’s lower house of parliament approved the measures late on Thursday just days after Paris was picked to host the European Banking Authority (EBA) giving new momentum to its bid to attract banking jobs after Brexit. “In order to improve the attractiveness of Paris as a financial centre in the context of Brexit and for social justice it seems preferable to exclude these bonuses from compulsory redundancy payouts and possible court awards” Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud told lawmakers. Goldman Sachs has already said it will make Paris and Frankfurt its European hubs after Brexit. Bank of America is also looking to lease more office space in Paris according to two sources familiar with the matter while Citigroup is applying for a licence to conduct investment banking activities in France. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon said in October the US bank might move 60 jobs to Paris. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain’s biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover will hire 5000 staff as it boosts its skills in autonomous and electric technology a welcome business endorsement as Prime Minister Theresa May starts Brexit talks after a botched election. JLR which employs more than 40000 people globally said it would hire 1000 electronic and software engineers as well as 4000 additional personnel including in manufacturing most of whom will be based in Britain. The recruitment process will take place over the next 12 months during Britain’s talks to leave the European Union which carmakers have warned must result in a deal which retains free and unfettered trade to protect jobs. Hours before the talks were due to begin in Brussels the heads of the UK’s biggest business lobbies called on the government to engage “continuously” with UK business interests and strike a deal that preserves the benefits of EU membership including tariff-free trade guarantees for EU citizens living in the UK and minimal customs formalities. Finance Minister Philip Hammond said leaving the EU without an agreement would be a “very very bad outcome for Britain” and he wanted an exit that would support employment and investment. “When I talk about a Brexit that supports British jobs British investment and British business I mean a Brexit that avoids those cliff edges” Hammond said in an interview with BBC television on Sunday. JLR which is owned by India’s Tata Motors will build its first electric vehicle the I-Pace in Austria but has said it wants to build such models in Britain if conditions such as support from government and academia are met. Automakers are racing to produce greener cars and improve charge times in a bid to meet rising customer demand and fulfil air quality targets but Britain lacks sufficient manufacturing capacity an area ministers have said they want to build up. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Michel Barnier told a closing news conference in Brussels that the talks had \"clarified\" some issues but that more needed to be done. \"We clarified some points without however making any great steps forward\" he said. Mr Barnier said there was \"still disagreement\" on how to resolve issues about citizens\\' rights after Brexit. He said the interpretation of rights must be \"genuinely consistent\" between the UK and the EU after Britain quits and suggested they must be applied through the European Court of Justice. \"We are continuing to work on the specific instruments and mechanisms which would give practical effect to this intention\" he said. Mr Barnier said that there was \"deadlock\" on the issue of the scale of Britain\\'s financial settlement and that there had been no negotiations on the issue this week. Mrs May\\'s announcement in her Florence speech that Britain would honour commitments entered into as an EU member was \"important\" he said. But he added: \"This week however the UK repeated that it was still not ready to spell out these commitments. \"There have therefore been no negotiations on this subject. We confined ourselves to technical discussions - useful discussions but technical discussions. \"On this question we have reached a state of deadlock which is very disturbing for thousands of project promoters in Europe and it\\'s disturbing also for taxpayers.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May shared her Chancellor’s view that Britain stood ready to consider alternative economic models following Brexit if forced to her spokeswoman said yesterday. Philip Hammond was quoted on Sunday as saying the country could change its economic model to regain competitiveness if it were to leave the EU without an agreement on access to the single market. “She shares the view that (Hammond) set out. That we would want to remain in the mainstream of a recognisable European style taxation system” she told reporters. “But if we are forced to do something different because we can’t get the right deal then we stand ready to do so.” The spokeswoman declined to comment on a fall in sterling to three-month lows over fears May will use a speech today to say Britain is set for a “hard” Brexit making a clean break from the EU’s single market. She also said she did not recognise media reports over the weekend which cited a government source saying May’s office was expecting a market correction as a result of the speech. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain could slash its headline corporation tax rate to 10 per cent from 20 per cent if the European Union refuses to agree a post-Brexit free trade deal or blocks UK-based financial services firms from accessing its market the Sunday Times reported citing an unidentified source. The newspaper said the idea had been put forward by Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s advisers amid growing fears other EU member states will take a hard line in Brexit negotiations. The proposal would be used to try and persuade the EU to grant \"passporting\" rights for financial services firms to continue operating across the EU the newspaper said. \"People say we have not got any cards\" the newspaper quoted an unidentified source familiar with the government\\'s thinking as saying. \"We have some quite good cards we can play if they start getting difficult with us. If they\\'re saying no passporting and high trade tariffs we can cut corporation tax to 10 per cent\" the newspaper quoted an anonymous source as saying. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

No EU national currently living lawfully in the UK will be made to leave on the day of Brexit under proposals outlined by\\xa0Theresa May\\xa0to her European Union counterparts. The Prime Minister told a European Council summit in Brussels that she wanted to offer \"certainty\" to the estimated three million EU expats in the UK and ensure that families are not split up by Brexit. But she made clear that the proposals would be adopted only if the same rights are granted to UK citizens living in the remaining 27 EU states in a reciprocal settlement. And she set up a series of probable clashes with the European Union by suggesting she could set an early cut-off date for residency rights and rejecting a Brussels demand for the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to retain powers to enforce rights following Brexit. Under Mrs May\\'s plans unveiled on the eve of the anniversary of the Brexit referendum EU nationals who have lived in the UK for five years by a specific cut-off date will be given the chance to take up \"settled status\" granting them rights to stay in the country and receive healthcare education welfare and pensions as if they were British citizens. Those resident for a shorter period will have the opportunity to stay on until they have reached the five-year threshold. Those arriving after the cut-off date but before the date of Brexit will have a \"grace period\" - expected to be two years - within which to regularise their immigration status with a view to later seeking settled status. The cut-off date is yet to be set but will come between the day when Britain formally notified Brussels of its intention to quit on April 29 2017 and the day when it finally leaves expected to be March 29 2019. Mrs May also promised that the system will be streamlined doing away with the 85-page permanent residency application form which has been the subject of loud complaints from EU expats. It is thought that the UK is reserving the option of setting an early cut-off for residency rights in case there is a late surge of migrants arriving as Brexit approaches. But the introduction of a \"grace period\" raises the possibility that large numbers arriving during withdrawal negotiations may be allowed to remain at least for a few years. And the outline deal leaves questions unanswered over whether individuals with settled status will be permitted to bring in children or spouses and whether the new status will be subject to conditions other than length of residency. Further details are expected to be revealed in a paper to be published by the UK Government on Monday. Speaking over dinner at the Brussels summit Mrs May told leaders of the other 27 EU nations: \"The UK\\'s position represents a fair and serious offer and one aimed at giving as much certainty as possible to citizens who have settled in the UK building careers and lives and contributing so much to our society.\" She said the UK did not want anyone currently in Britain to be forced to leave. But the proposals are likely to meet resistance in Brussels which has already published its own formal proposals which would guarantee the rights enjoyed under EU law to any European expat resident in the UK on the date of Brexit. Other than the different cut-off date the key point of contention to be thrashed out in talks between Brexit Secretary David Davis and the EU\\'s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is likely to be over the question of jurisdiction. The EU proposals stipulate that the European Commission should have \"full powers\" to monitor and the ECJ \"full jurisdiction\" for as long as citizens\\' rights remain protected under the withdrawal agreement. But Mrs May told her fellow leaders: \"The commitment that we make to EU citizens will be enshrined in UK law and will be enforced through our highly respected courts.\" And a senior British official added: \"We have been clear on the ECJ that we are taking back control of our own laws.\" It is understood that there was no discussion of Mrs May\\'s proposal at the Brussels dinner as leaders of the EU27 stuck to their position that all negotiations must be conducted through Mr Barnier and not through individual national leaders. Mrs May left the meeting shortly after delivering her statement in order to allow the EU27 to receive a briefing from Mr Barnier on progress in the first round of negotiations which took place on Monday. Her announcement came at the end of a day which saw EU leaders agree to pursue closer defence co-operation and threaten legislation to force internet companies to remove extremist material from websites. And European Council president Donald Tusk spoke of his \"dream\" that there could still be a U-turn on the Brexit decision before the expected date of withdrawal in March 2019. Quoting John Lennon he said that when people asked him if he thought there was any possibility of the UK remaining a member he replied: \"The European Union was built on dreams that seemed impossible to achieve. \"So who knows. You may say I\\'m a dreamer but I\\'m not the only one.\" But Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said that reopening the question of whether the UK will actually leave would only fuel uncertainty. \"I am not a dreamer. And I am not the only one\" retorted Mr Michel. \"What we also need is certainty for our companies in Belgium in Europe. If we back this image that Brexit perhaps would not happen it brings an uncertainty.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain is likely to go into arduous talks on its exit from the European Union without a deal to keep Prime Minister Theresa May in power as negotiations with a Northern Irish \"kingmaker\" party grind into a second week. After a tumultuous week that pitched Britain into its deepest political crisis since the Brexit referendum a year ago May\\'s future was uncertain due to her botched gamble on a snap election and a muted response to a deadly fire in London. Fighting for her political survival May has been trying to strike a deal with a small Northern Irish Protestant party to avoid a second election that could delay Brexit talks and damage the $2.5 trillion economy. While she is ultimately expected to reach a deal a source in the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) told Reuters that an agreement to support her minority government was not likely before next week. The price of such a deal remains unclear. \"If there is the expected positive outcome it will be at least the start of next week before anything is signed off\" a DUP source told Reuters. The party has refused to give a timeframe for reaching a deal though May is due in Brussels for an EU summit on June 22-23 when she will want to show she has a solid grip on power. Having lost a majority in parliament May needs the DUP\\'s 10 lawmakers to win any kind of vote including on the pieces of legislation needed to enact Britain\\'s divorce from the EU. When asked if a deal was in the making DUP leader Arlene Foster told reporters in Dublin: \"I think you know it takes two to tango and we\\'re ready to dance.\" Foster later said it was \"right and proper\" for the DUP to support May\\'s legislative programme which is due to be announced next week and will be the first formal test of her ability to govern. A source in May\\'s Conservative Party said talks continued today. The party has refused to give a timeframe for reaching a deal though May is due in Brussels for an EU summit on June 22-23 when she will want to show she has a solid grip on power. Besides forging a deal to keep her job and preparing for Brexit talks May is also grappling with a crisis over the breakdown in power-sharing between the pro-British DUP and the Catholic nationalist Sinn Fein party in Northern Ireland\\'s separate devolved government. While European leaders try to gauge what to expect from the Brexit talks due to begin in Brussels on Monday May is so weakened that her own Brexit strategy is the subject of public debate in her own party and by her potential allies. \"We want to see a Brexit that works for everybody not just in Northern Ireland from my perspective but in the Republic of Ireland as well so it is about a sensible Brexit\" Foster told reporters. In a separate interview she said the talks with the Conservatives had covered corporation tax and same-sex marriage. The DUP is one of the most socially conservative parties in Europe having sought to maintain some of its strictest limits on abortion and consistently opposed gay marriage. May wants to negotiate the divorce and the future trading relationship with the EU before Britain leaves in March 2019 followed by what she calls a phased implementation process to give business time to prepare for the impact of the divorce. But her vulnerability at home means that her plan to leave the EU\\'s lucrative single market and customs union in order to impose strict limits on immigration is under intense scrutiny. Prompted by her poor election showing particularly among pro-EU young people who fear losses of jobs and opportunity for Brexit some of her most senior ministers and two former Conservative prime ministers have called for a rethink. May\\'s finance minister Philip Hammond said today that Britain should prioritise protecting jobs and economic growth. \"My clear view and I believe the view of the majority of people in Britain is that we should prioritise protecting jobs protecting economic growth protecting prosperity as we enter those negotiations and take them forward\" Hammond said. \"As we enter negotiations next week we will do so in a spirit of cooperation taking a pragmatic approach trying to find a solution that works both for the UK and the European Union 27\" he told reporters before a meeting of the 28 EU finance ministers in Luxembourg. Britain\\'s Brexit ministry said today that no deal could be struck on exiting unless the future relationship with the bloc was taken into account. \"Our view is that a withdrawal agreement and terms of the future relationship must be agreed alongside each other\" a spokesman for Britain\\'s Brexit ministry said. \"We believe that the withdrawal process cannot be concluded without the future relationship also being taken into account. The withdrawal and future are intimately linked.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said today it would support Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s government on legislation concerning Britain\\'s exit from the European Union securing her a slender majority in parliament. May struck a deal with the DUP today to back her administration after she failed to secure an outright victory in a botched June 8 snap election. \"The DUP... agrees to support the government on legislation pertaining to the United Kingdom\\'s exit from the European Union; and legislation pertaining to national security\" a document published by May\\'s office said. The DUP also agreed to support the British government in parliamentary votes on the budget and on all Brexit and national security legislation Prime Minister Theresa May said later. May also urged Northern Irish political parties to agree over the province\\'s government by a June 29 deadline. \"The DUP will support the Conservative government on votes on the Queen\\'s Speech the Budget and legislation relating to Brexit and national security\" May said. \"The agreement makes clear that we remain steadfast to our commitments as set out in the Belfast Agreement and its successors and in governing in the interests of all parts of the community in Northern Ireland\" she added. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A Conservative peer has implored parliamentarians who voted Remain to stay true to their convictions as thousands of anti-Brexit demonstrators marched on Westminster. A sea of blue and yellow Remainers amassed outside the Houses of Parliament days after politicians returned to parliament following the summer recess. It comes as MPs are set to vote on the repeal bill formally known as the EU (Withdrawal) Bill on Monday for the first time amid concerns over the progress of Brexit negotiations. Addressing the crowds in Parliament Square Tory peer Baroness Patience Wheatcroft appealed to demonstrators to keep fighting to stay in the EU telling them: \"You have history on your side.\" She said that whatever is negotiated \"will be worse for Britain\" and that Brexit will mean \"fewer jobs and a less prosperous Britain\". Protesters make their way along Piccadilly during of a pro-EU People\\'s March For Europe in London. Appealing to her parliamentary colleagues she said: \"We have to stop Brexit. Since we joined the EU we\\'ve had an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity. It must be right to try and maintain that. \"It\\'s not undemocratic to try to persuade the electorate to think again about Brexit. That\\'s democracy at work. \"So I say to my colleagues over the road: \\'You know in your hearts what\\'s right. Many of you campaigned for Remain now have the strength of your convictions. Do not be bowed down by the whips. Follow your consciences.\\'\" Activist and musician Sir Bob Geldof who had been expected to speak did not address the crowd and could not be seen at the three-hour rally. Organisers said there were between 10-15000 people at the start of the march through central London estimating around 50000 protesters at its height as people joined. The People\\'s March For Europe carries the message \"unite rethink and reject Brexit\" and organisers said leaving the EU \"no longer holds credibility inside Westminster let alone on the streets of Britain\". EU flags were out in force as were Exit From Brexit placards while T-shirts with the words Remoaner Till I Die and Je Suis Un Saboteur could be seen. Former cabinet minister Sir Ed Davey told the crowd he was \"embarrassed\" for Great Britain. I\\'ve gone from anger to distress from fury to despair Liberal Democrat MP for Kingston and Surbiton said: \"I\\'ve gone from anger to distress from fury to despair. But since the Brexit negotiations began there\\'s a third emotion I\\'ve been feeling. \"Embarrassment. Embarrassment at our country\\'s leaders. Embarrassment for Great Britain.\" After being interrupted by boos he said he felt embarrassed \"that these shambolic people are supposed to be representing us. They can\\'t even negotiate.\" He personally thanked Conservative and Labour Remainers who voted for him to be their MP so he could continue to oppose Brexit. Jean Lambert member of the European Parliament (MEP) for London said she wanted a \"meaningful vote\" for people across the UK following the Brexit negotiations. The Green Party member said: \"Even basic consumer protection says you have a cooling-off period a time to consider whether or not you are being offered what fits your needs and your ambition. \"So (I want) a vote for the people not just the politicians.\" The blue and yellow demonstrators observed a minute\\'s silence in respect for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire breaking into applause as the 60 seconds ended. They were led in the reflection by a Sikh leader local to the North Kensington community Bhupinder Singh who said the Brexit vote had led to an \"us and them\" society a bigger rich-poor divide and an increase in racism. Recalling how the local community came together after Grenfell and urging the crowd against division he said: \"The word community contains unity and that should be your catchphrase as well. That united we are strong.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The Bank of England expects Britain to lose up to 75000 financial services jobs after the country leaves the European Union in 2019 the BBC reported today. \"I understand that senior figures at the Bank are using the number as a \\'reasonable scenario\\' particularly if there is no specific UK-EU financial services deal\" the BBC\\'s economics editor Kamal Ahmed wrote without providing a more specific source. He added the BoE thought the figure could vary depending on the terms on which Britain left the EU and that 75000 was at the upper end of projections provided by other groups. The BoE did not have an immediate comment. Two BoE deputy governors whose roles cover financial services Jon Cunliffe and Sam Woods are due to speak to a parliament committee about Brexit on Wednesday. The BoE is currently assessing British-based financial services firms\\' contingency plans to minimise disruption after Brexit. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Jeremy Corbyn leader of the British opposition Labour Party said on Thursday he would fight any attempt by Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s government to use Britain\\'s exit from the European Union as a way to turn the country into a tax haven. Speaking ahead of a meeting with the prime ministers of Sweden and Italy as well as the EU\\'s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier he said that he had arrived in Brussels to ensure negotiations were on track. Corbyn warned that if the UK walked away from the EU without a deal it would be \"catastrophic\" for UK manufacturing industry. Elsewhere in Brussels May said she would pledge continued British cooperation with the EU on issues like defense and security after Brexit and looked forward to progress in talks on Britain\\'s withdrawal in the coming weeks. EU leaders plan to issue a statement after May leaves on Friday saying they hope a deal can be struck at their next summit in December. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The FT said that Britain had started informal talks about joining the bloc in a bid to boost post-Brexit exports. Although the United States pulled out of the talks to form the bloc nearly a year ago other TPP countries have pledged to move forward with plans for a trade group. The TPP has so far involved only countries around the Pacific Rim such as Japan Canada and Mexico. However junior trade minister Greg Hands said there was no geographical restriction that would prevent Britain\\'s participation. \"Nothing is excluded in all of this\" he told the Financial Times. \"With these kind of plurilateral relationships there doesn\\'t have to be any geographical restriction.\" EU rules state that Britain cannot agree new trade deals before it leaves the bloc in March 2019. The newspaper quoted an official from a TPP country as saying it was \"way too soon\" to discuss UK accession before a Brexit deal. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The EU (Withdrawal) Bill revokes the 1972 Act which took the UK into the European Economic Area but also transposes all relevant EU law into British statute so there are no holes in the law book at the point of Brexit. - What happened to the Bill in the House of Lords? Peers defeated the Government on 15 issues introducing amendments on issues ranging from future UK membership of the customs union and European Economic Area (EEA) to ministers\\' use of \"Henry VIII\" powers to force through changes without parliamentary scrutiny and the questions of whether MPs should get a \"meaningful vote\" on the final Brexit deal. - What was the government\\'s response? The government has accepted one of the Lords amendments allowing the UK to continue to co-operate with EU agencies which it says is already its policy. It opposes the other 14 and will be seeking to overturn them though in some cases it is offering a compromise solution. - What are the crunch votes and when will they happen? Issues most likely to provoke rebellions include the\"meaningful vote\" and the question of whether the date of Brexit should be written into law - both due for votes on Tuesday afternoon - as well as whether the UK should stay in the customs union or EEA which should come early on Wednesday evening. - Is the government guaranteed to get what it wants? Far from it. Even with the support of 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs Mrs May has a working majority of just 13 in the Commons which means she can be defeated by a rebellion of as few as seven Tory backbenchers. Some 13 Tories have signed a \"soft Brexit\" amendment to the separate Trade Bill and it is thought that a few others may be considering breaking ranks. On the other side a handful of Labour Leavers are likely to back the government in breach of their own party whip making it difficult to predict outcomes. - What is the \"meaningful vote\" about? The government has promised MPs a vote on the final Brexit deal but initially said it would be a simple \"take it or leave it\" choice. The House of Lords amended the Bill so that if MPs reject the deal they can direct ministers to go back and renegotiate. The government\\'s compromise is that a minister would come to the House within 28 days of a deal being rejected to tell MPs what will happen next. This vote is on a knife-edge with the Opposition and Tory rebels hopeful of victory. - How about the Customs Union? The Lords passed an amendment stating that Brexit cannot go ahead until a minister has presented a report setting out what the UK has done to try to negotiate continued CU membership. Although these terms would not necessarily keep the UK in the customs union defeat in the Commons would be politically explosive as it would show Mrs May has no majority for one of her key \"red lines\". A threatened rebellion may have been seen off by a last-minute compromise amendment reached between Remain and Leave supporting MPs calling for \"a customs arrangement\". - And the EEA vote? The Lords amendment would require ministers to prioritise Norway-style membership of the EEA which would again breach Mrs May\\'s red lines and be seen by Leave backers as \"Brexit in name only\". There is little chance of Government defeat on this issue as Jeremy Corbyn has ordered his MPs to abstain and back an alternative Labour amendment requiring access to a European \"internal market\". - What happens next? The Bill will return to the Lords on June 18 kicking off a process of \"Parliamentary ping-pong\" which sees it bounce from House to House until agreement is reached. The government\\'s ultimate weapon of invoking the Parliament Act to ensure the Commons gets its way is less potent than usual because of the tight deadline for completing legislation ahead of Brexit Day on March 29 next year. - Is Theresa May\\'s position in danger? Few at Westminster expect a challenge to the Prime Minister\\'s position this week. Some Europhile Tories may hold back from rebelling to avoid destabilising her and risking handing the leadership to a hardline Brexiteer. Conversely committed Eurosceptics seem to be keeping their powder dry unsure that the PM would be replaced by one of their champions even if they were able to unseat her. - Is it all over once this Bill has passed? No. There will be plenty more chances for upsets as separate Bills on customs and trade come before MPs next month followed by legislation on future immigration rules later in the year and a Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill once the final Brexit deal is struck. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The European Union\\'s next long-term budget has to be larger than the current 1% of EU GDP (gross domestic product) despite the loss of major net contributor Britain the head of the European Commission said on Monday. Speaking at a conference on the next seven-year budget of the EU which starts in 2021 Jean-Claude Juncker said it would have to finance joint EU policies in the areas of defence security migration climate change cohesion and agriculture. \"Britain will be leaving us... so we need to find ... a means to reacting to the loss of a several billion euros when a significant contributor goes\" Juncker said. The EU\\'s budget Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said the gap from Brexit would be €12-13 billion per year. Juncker said that while some EU policies could be reviewed and modernised EU governments needed to commit more money to the EU budget to finance new areas of joint interest. \"All that cannot be funded from just 1% of Europe\\'s wealth\" Juncker said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British consumers and\\xa0businesses became more pessimistic about the economy’s prospects in June according to surveys on Friday that suggested Brexit worries and global trade spats may be taking their toll. Britain’s headline gauge of consumer confidence compiled by market research firm GfK for the European Commission fell unexpectedly to -9 from -7 in May. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index to hold steady. And Lloyds Bank’s\\xa0business\\xa0confidence barometer also eased to 29 per cent from 35 per cent in May marking its lowest levels this year. Both the GfK and Lloyds surveys highlighted waning confidence about Britain’s economic prospects. Britain will leave the European Union in March 2019 but a transitional trade agreement has not been finalised and there are disagreements among Prime Minister Theresa May’s team over how much effort to put into maintaining close ties with the EU. “We are reporting falls across all key measures” said Joe Staton client strategy director at GfK. “Scores on personal finance are down but there is a more marked deterioration in our levels of optimism about the general state of the economy.” Lloyds Bank said global trade worries and Brexit uncertainty likely weighed on corporate confidence in June although it added that confidence was still around long-term average levels. Separately the Confederation of British Industry said its private sector growth indicator slid to +6 in the three months to June from from +10 in May. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Companies face an extra £20 billion a year in costs to comply with the customs arrangement if there is a no-deal Brexit Britain’s most senior tax official said yesterday. Jon Thompson permanent secretary at Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs told lawmakers that leaving the EU with no deal would cost business a similar amount to a customs arrangement known as “max fac” – or maximum facilitation – because companies would have to fill in customs declarations.\\xa0 “If we move to WTO (World Trade Organisation) rules that would definitely require customs declarations so it would be similar in terms of costs” Thompson said when asked about the cost of a no-deal Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to take Britain out of the customs union with the EU a step she argues is necessary so that London can strike its own trade deals around the world. But May’s government has yet to set out to the EU’s satisfaction how it would achieve that without erecting a land border to control goods between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland which Britain has promised it will not do. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

With just six months to go until the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union negotiations are at what Prime Minister Theresa May has called an impasse. If she can clinch a deal with the EU she will still have to sell it to her divided Conservative Party and win parliamentary approval. If she cannot the United Kingdom could face leaving without a deal a national election or even another referendum. Below are significant dates as Britain nears its departure from the EU in March: LABOUR PARTY CONFERENCE - September 23 to 26 Britain\\'s opposition Labour Party will vote against any deal May clinches with the European Union and is open to a second referendum with the option of staying in the bloc Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said on Tuesday. CONSERVATIVE PARTY CONFERENCE - September 30 to October 3 The Conservative Party often holds its annual conferences in a febrile atmosphere. Last year May gave a calamitous speech in which she lost her voice was handed a resignation notice by a prankster and the stage backdrop fell apart as she spoke. This time tensions over her Brexit plan are likely to dominate and rivals such as former foreign minister Boris Johnson are likely to use the occasion to make their leadership pitch to grassroots members. Although May will be keen to focus on domestic policy rather than Brexit the conference will allow her to sound out support for whatever agreement she is hoping to reach with the EU. EUROPEAN COUNCIL - October 18 May meets fellow EU leaders and the European Commission to try to seal deals on the terms of Britain\\'s withdrawal and what kind of relationship it has in the future. Top EU officials have said the meeting will be \"the moment of truth\" in the negotiations and they will gauge whether talks have advanced enough to formalise a Brexit deal in November. The agreement will have to cover trade and how to prevent a return of border controls on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic which will become Britain\\'s only land border with the EU. These are the main areas of disagreement which have caused May\\'s government to step up preparations for leaving without any deal. Both sides have said that talks could slip into November without endangering the overall timeline. SPECIAL BREXIT SUMMIT - weekend of November 17-18 EU leaders agreed in Salzburg in mid-September to hold a special summit on the weekend of November 17-18 to seal a Brexit deal with Britain if it is done. EU COUNCIL - December 13-14 European Union leaders are due at an EU Council meeting on December 13-14. If a deal is not struck in November this summit could be one of the last chances for a deal if parliaments on both sides are to ratify the deal by exit day in March. UK PARLIAMENTARY VOTE ON BREXIT DEAL - Unscheduled If May secures a deal she has to get parliament to approve it. She would need about 320 votes in parliament to get approval. Her Conservatives hold 316 seats in the 650-seat lower house and she relies on a Northern Irish party to win parliamentary votes. Labour has indicated it would vote against her deal so unless she can win over her own lawmakers she could lose a vote in parliament. Failure could trigger a move against her leadership of the Conservative Party or the government\\'s collapse and an early election. EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT RATIFICATION - Unscheduled The European Parliament must also sign off on any agreement reached between May and the other 27 EU leaders. If the legislative starts dealing with it in November or even December it should still be able to complete its elaborate ratification process in time for Brexit day. It could hold a final plenary vote during a plenary session set for March 11-14. But it would be getting busy then with campaigning ahead of European elections next May - in which Britain would no longer take part. EU officials have suggested a further delay may still be possible if negotiators are very close to sealing a deal. But it would just be a few extra weeks at best as the current EU parliament holds its last plenary session on April 15-18 2019. That is already beyond the current Brexit date. NO DEAL STATEMENT If there is no deal by January 21 2019 the British government must make a statement within five days on what the United Kingdom plans to do according to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act of 2018. May said this week a \\'no-deal\\' Brexit would be better than the EU\\'s standing offer. BREXIT - March 29 2019 at 2300 GMT. Britain will formally leave the EU. Providing an exit deal is agreed there will be a transition period during which the bulk of the bloc\\'s rules and regulations continue to apply while the British government formulates and implements replacement policies on issues such as immigration. TRANSITION PERIOD ENDS - December 31 2020 The transition period designed to ease the impact on businesses and relieve uncertainty is due to end. Little has been agreed so far about the new arrangements between Britain and the EU on trade customs and other major issues. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

European leaders and Prime Minister Theresa May agreed Thursday on a short delay to Britain\\'s divorce from the European Union in the hope of ensuring an orderly Brexit. Britain had faced a sharp cliff-edge deadline of March 29 to leave but May\\'s EU colleagues said the split could wait until May 22 if British lawmakers approve a withdrawal accord next week.\\xa0As of tonight April 12 is the new March 29 But if the House of Commons rejects the deal - as it has done twice before - Brexit will take place on April 12 unless Britain has decided by then to take part in this year\\'s European Parliamentary elections.\\xa0 \"April 12 is the key date in terms of the UK deciding whether to hold European parliament elections\" EU Council president and summit host Donald Tusk said announcing the arrangement.\\xa0 Britain would need time to legislate to take part in the May 23 to 26 election and May has insisted it will not try preferring in her words \"to honour\" voters\\' decision to end London\\'s 46-year-old membership. \"I believe strongly that it would be wrong to ask people in the UK to participate in these elections three years after voting to leave the European Union\" May said confirming the agreement. \\'Responsibility lies with the British\\' Tusk said that if the vote is not organised then a further \"extension will automatically become impossible\" and that even with an election all 27 remaining EU member states would unanimously have to approve it. \"March 29 is over. As of tonight April 12 is the new March 29\" an EU official said. \"On April 12 we have to know where things stand ... if we don\\'t have a response by then\\xa0we will have a no deal Brexit\" Luxembourg\\'s Prime Minister Xavier Bettel warned. And French President Emmanuel Macron who had taken a harder public line than some of his colleagues declared: \"The responsibility now lies with the British and I think that\\'s the big achievement of the day.\" Despite a extraordinary joint warning from Britain\\'s business and trade union leaders that the economic disruptions of a no deal Brexit would present a \"national emergency\" May had refused to rule out walking away. Even as she was meeting the EU 27 in Brussels for the European Council summit an online petition hosted by the UK parliament and calling for Brexit to be abandoned topped two million signatures.\\xa0 It still remains far from clear that May will be able to get the withdrawal agreement she signed last November past the House of Commons and she turned up the heat on her own MPs after the Brexit talks. \"What the decision today underlines is the importance of the House of Commons passing a Brexit deal next week\" she insisted. \"Tomorrow morning I am returning to the UK and working hard on building support to get the deal through... I hope we can all agree we are now at the moment of decision.\" May had requested a short delay until June 30 to allow time for the ratification of her deal if it approved but European leaders decided they did not want Brexit concerns to linger into the election campaign. Deep divisions Despite winning the extension there is a chance the decision might be taken out of May\\'s hands. She had intended to hold a third vote on her deal this week but the Speaker of the House of Commons blocked it citing 400-year-old precedent that says the same proposition cannot be put to MPs again and again. May is hoping that the EU summit\\'s approval of fresh guarantees about the agreement will overcome the speaker\\'s objections but even if the deal goes forward rebel MPs may seize control of the process. May\\'s deal remains hugely unpopular among MPs on all sides of the Brexit debate with some arguing it keeps Britain too closely to the EU and others saying it would not keep it close enough. British voters are also sharply divided.\\xa0 Many pro-Europeans support a lengthy delay to Brexit believing it would increase pressure at home for a general election or for a second referendum that might reverse the decision.\\xa0 But there is huge anger among those who want to leave the EU and do not understand why it is taking so long while eight of May\\'s senior ministers last week voted against any delay. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

If Britain leaves the European Union with no deal in place it will cause the Dutch government at least €2.3 billion in direct costs through 2023 the Court of Audit said on Monday. The court which performs official analyses for government decision-making purposes noted that the Cabinet and much of Dutch industry have been preparing \"intensively\" for Brexit since 2016 but the country\\'s customs office still may not be ready in time in a \"worst-case scenario.\" Britain is the Netherlands\\' third-largest trading partner after Germany and Belgium. The figures released by the agency on Monday do not take into account lost revenue if Britain\\'s departure accompanies a wider regional recession. They complement the largest official study on indirect costs to the Dutch economy to date conducted by the country\\'s Economic Policy Analysis (CPB) bureau in 2016. That study found that trade lost as a result of Brexit would reduce the Dutch economy by an amount increasing to 1.2 per cent of GDP annually by 2030 or €10 billion. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Last updated 9.48pm -\\xa0 \\xa0 British Prime Minister Theresa May will\\xa0be returning to Brussels on Saturday to hammer out an outline of Britain\\'s future ties with the European Union after her meeting with the head of the bloc\\'s executive on Wednesday failed to bridge the gaps. May met European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker for about an hour and a half to try to win commitments aimed at helping her appease rebels at home opposed to her draft Brexit treaty. \"There were some remaining issues which we have discussed\" May said afterwards. \"I will be returning on Saturday for further meetings including again with President Juncker to discuss how we can ensure that we can conclude this process.\" With just over four months before Britain\\'s departure May is trying to finalise an outline of future relations before a summit of EU leaders on Sunday due to endorse the Brexit accord. Raising the stakes EU diplomats said they had been told that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was not willing to come on Sunday for any more talks meaning a text must be ready beforehand. Spain\\'s prime minister meanwhile insisted he would vote against the draft deal unless he wins assurances over the disputed peninsula of Gibraltar. May said negotiators from both sides would continue working on the text. \"I believe we have been able to give sufficient direction for them to be able to resolve those remaining issues\" she said. A spokesman for the European Commission said \"very good progress\" was made at May\\'s meeting with Juncker: \"Work is continuing.\" Diplomats in Brussels said EU states\\' concerns over fishing rights and future trade ties had largely been addressed in the political declaration on the EU-UK future ties that would form a package with the legally binding divorce deal meaning Spain\\'s concerns were the final issue to be settled. \"The only thing really outstanding is Gibraltar\" said one EU diplomat. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez demanded assurances that the future of the disputed British territory of Gibraltar would be settled through direct talks with Madrid. \"If this is not solved by Sunday Spain a pro-European government will unfortunately have to vote \\'No\\'\" he said at an evening news conference in Valladolid with his Portuguese counterpart. Many in Brussels thought Sanchez was trying to score points with voters at home before a Dec. 2 local election in the southern Andalusia region. They said the issue could be solved by the leaders and warned Madrid not to put the whole Brexit agreement at risk. As an olive branch to Brexit campaigners in Britain May was seeking to include their proposed technological solutions to keep the border open on the island of Ireland. The EU has previously dismissed these ideas as unrealistic at this stage. NORTHERN IRELAND The British and European parliaments must ratify the tentative deal to end more than 40 years of partnership before Brexit day on March 29 2019 or Britain would be set to crash out of the EU with no treaty. The publication last week of a draft exit treaty sparked the biggest crisis of May\\'s premiership with two cabinet ministers quitting and dozens of Conservative members of parliament calling on her to step down. They accuse May of making too many concessions to the EU while others oppose Brexit altogether. May hopes the blueprint on future relations -- a political document of about 20 pages meant to be agreed side-by-side with the legally binding 600-page exit treaty -- will help win back enough support at home for her approach to pass in parliament. The Northern Ireland party that props up May\\'s government said it does not plan to withdraw its support yet despite opposition to her withdrawal deal. \"The confidence and supply agreement ... is very much still in existence\" Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster told the BBC broadcaster. Asked when the party might consider pulling the plug on support for May Foster said: \"We\\'re not there yet.\" Despite the political turmoil around her May has shown no sign in public of any doubt that she can bring home a deal. The draft treaty envisages Britain staying in a customs union with the bloc which many Brexit supporters see as a compromise too far. The EU is trying to discourage Britain from any renegotiation of the draft treaty while also seeking to assuage concerns expressed by some of the remaining 27 member states. While unanimity among the 27 is not legally required to endorse the deal now the bloc seeks a unified stance. DEMANDS Both sides have also been advancing contingency plans for the worst case scenario -- a no-deal Brexit. Diplomats in Brussels said Britain was also seeking an easy flow of goods after Brexit a position which was too close to the privileges allowed only for countries that sign up to EU single market rules including free flow of people and services. \"The UK wants free movement of goods which they won\\'t get because that\\'s back to discussing partial access to the single market which we don\\'t do\" another diplomat said. In addition France has called for more guarantees on future access to Britain\\'s fishing waters which London wants to keep firmly under its control after Brexit. Most in the EU are determined to get the deal over the line with a third EU diplomat saying: \"There is plenty of negotiating time left to achieve that.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s choice would be to leave the European Union without a deal or abandon Brexit altogether if its parliament rejects an agreement between the EU and Prime Minister Theresa May European Council President Donald Tusk said on Friday. \"A few days before the vote in the House of Commons it is becoming more and more clear that this deal is the best possible -- in fact the only possible one\" Tusk said ruling out any renegotiation by the EU if the British parliament votes down last Sunday\\'s deal on December 11. \"If this deal is rejected in the Commons we are left with... an alternative: no deal or no Brexit at all. I want to reassure you that the EU is prepared for every scenario\" he said told Reuters during the G20 meeting in Argentina. Tusk will chair an EU summit two days after the British parliament votes on a deal that May has also said is the best London can get.

British ministers agreed Tuesday to make no-deal Brexit planning \"an operational priority\" amid continued opposition to Prime Minister Theresa\\'s May draft divorce deal just 14 weeks before the country leaves the EU. Following a meeting of her cabinet -- the last before parliament breaks for the Christmas/New Year break -- Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said around 3500 troops would be on stand-by to help deal with the \"any contingencies\" from a no-deal outcome. But Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said ministers still hoped to secure backing for May\\'s agreement with the EU in a House of Commons vote delayed until next month. He added that any responsible government would intensify preparations for the \"default option\" of leaving the European Union without a deal on March 29 next year. \"We agreed that preparing for no deal will be an operational priority within government\" Barclay said. \"But our overall priority remains to secure a deal.\" He said departments would step up their advice to businesses on how best to prepare for the scenario which many fear could be catastrophic for the British economy. Businesses will be provided with a 100-plus page online preparation pack and emails will be sent to 80000 of those most likely to be impacted over the next few days according to Downing Street. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

While significant attention has focused on understanding the potential impact of a hard Brexit on the income of people in the UK much less is known about the impact on the rest of the EU. We know that the UK has a large trade deficit with some big and influential EU economies such as Germany. Therefore some have argued that this will result in these countries influencing the EU negotiating position and eventually offering a relatively generous deal to the UK. But our calculations find the opposite to be true. Building on recent research by two of us into different Brexit scenarios we looked at how a no-deal Brexit might affect the rest of the EU. We also assessed what would happen if the EU broke up entirely and all countries were left to trade on WTO-only rules. The magnitude of this gives us a sense of how important it is for the EU to stand firm in negotiations against the UK. Our research uses a gravity model which is widely used in the international trade literature. Many economists consider it to be the best tool for conducting applied trade policy. In essence it is based on the idea that two countries trade in proportion to the size of their economies and trade less the further away they are to one another because this is more costly. As well as being firmly rooted in economic theory it captures many features of the real world without being overcomplicated and predicts trade flows remarkably well. Our new results indicate that all EU27 countries will lose out from a disorderly Brexit but that losses are not distributed evenly between the rest of the EU countries. Roughly speaking there are three groups of countries.  The country that loses the most in terms of GDP around 1% is Ireland. This is expected given its geographic proximity common language and historical ties with the UK. The second largest decline in GDP from a no-deal Brexit is observed for Cyprus at around 0.2% of its GDP. This result is surprising to some extent given the distance of Cyprus from the UK. But it could be explained by common institutions (Cyprus was a colony of the UK until 1960) as well as the close historical and business ties between the two islands. After Ireland and Cyprus the vast majority of EU countries will face a decline of their GDP from 0.18% (Spain) to just below 0.1% (Croatia). And the last group of EU countries from Central and Eastern Europe will have among the lowest decline in GDP. Hungary with 0.08% and Austria with 0.03% of GDP. It is interesting to note that the four biggest EU27 countries will face a small drop in their GDP in the case of a No Deal Brexit scenario. Germany faces a 0.16% drop; France 0.17%; Italy 0.14% and Spain 0.18%. Hence the overall effect on the EU27 will be a fairly small decline in their combined GDP – a weighted average of 0.17%. In comparison we find that a no-deal Brexit will reduce the UK’s GDP by a staggering 5.8% of GDP. These results can easily be understood when we consider the fact that each individual EU country trades much more with the rest of the EU as a whole than just the UK. Consequently each remaining EU country will have much more to lose in the event of the UK getting a deal that includes the benefits of EU membership without any of the costs as this would undermine the future existence of the EU. To further understand the potential impact of a collapse of the EU project we present evidence on what will be the effect for each individual EU country. Here the assumption is that the EU breaks down and all EU countries begin trading under WTO rules.  In such a scenario the GDP of the EU countries would fall by 4.7% on average with Belgium Luxembourg and the Netherlands experiencing the highest declines of 5.5% 5.4% and 5.3% of their GDP respectively. The rest of the countries face similar economic losses from 5.2% of GDP for Austria to just below 4% for Greece. The lowest loss in terms of GDP is for Cyprus with a 3.2% decline. Note that in this scenario the UK’s GDP will be reduced by 4.5%. From the above analysis it is apparent that EU countries have much more to lose from the disintegration of the EU than Brexit. Following the gravity model this is because countries tend to lose more in terms of international trade and consequently their GDP when their deep economic ties are cut with their bigger neighbours. Hence it is no surprise that the EU27 has shown a consistent and unified stance towards resisting the UK’s demands during the Brexit process. On this basis there is little evidence to support the idea that EU negotiators will be forthcoming with a last minute significantly more favourable Brexit package.

Given the amount of travel between the UK and the EU for business and leisure it was crucial for the EU Council and the European Parliament to come finalise the proposal to waive visa requirements to UK nationals for short stay visits to the EU post-Brexit the Malta Business Bureau said on Friday. The visa waiver to UK nationals would apply on condition of reciprocity – although the UK government has already indicated that it would not require EU citizens travelling to the UK for short stays to require a visa. If the UK does introduce visa requirements for any one of the EU’s member states the reciprocity mechanism will be reconsidered and the EU as a bloc will be required to introduce counterbalancing measures. “Irrespective of diverging views on Brexit and the economic challenges it will undoubtedly bring citizens should be spared the negative impact as much as possible” MBB president Simon De Cesare said. “Introducing visa requirements would have resulted in unnecessary bureaucracy and costs for citizens.” The bureau said that the outcome was positive for tourism and the Maltese hospitality sector which relies on thousands of UK nationals visiting Malta. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Arnd Wiegmann/Reuters  German business morale rose in September a survey showed yesterday signalling that executives\\xa0 had brushed off concerns about Brexit that had weighed on their mood last month. The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index rose to 109.5 from an upwardly revised 106.3 in August the biggest monthly increase since July 2010. “Companies are clearly more optimistic about the months ahead. They are also more satisfied with their current business situation” Ifo head Clemens Fuest said in a statement. “The German economy is expecting a golden autumn”. A separate index measuring corporate expectations in Europe’s biggest economy over a six-month horizon rose to 104.5. “The Brexit shock has been digested for now” said Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe adding\\xa0 that German executives appear\\xa0 to have overcome the “small amount of uncertainty” created by Britain’s decision in June to leave the European Union. A breakdown of the headline figure showed that sentiment had improved in construction manufacturing wholesaling and retailing. The German economy is expecting a golden autumn The economy has been driven by rising state spending linked to the influx of a record number of migrants last year higher private consumption and a flourishing construction sector – all supported by record low interest rates. However industrial production fell the most in 23 months in July while exports unexpectedly posted their steepest drop in nearly a year adding to evidence that manufacturing is losing momentum as overseas demand particularly from Asia wanes. So yesterday’s Ifo figures were a positive surprise for economists. “All in all disappointing hard data in July and falling soft\\xa0 data since the Brexit vote had provided further evidence that the\\xa0 German economy was losing momentum” ING economist Carsten Brzeski said. “Today’s Ifo index suggests that at least the Brexit fears have disappeared as quickly as they had emerged” he added. Economists say that in the longer term Germany cannot continue relying on domestic consumption and construction for growth and both structural reforms and investments are needed to foster a new economic cycle. “Whether the strong (Ifo) reading is the start of another golden economic Fall or just a flash in the pan is too early to tell” said Brzeski. The German economy grew\\xa0 0.4 per cent on the quarter between April and June. Regarding third-quarter growth Ifo economist Wohlrabe said the economy remained on a solid footing\\xa0 though he added that growth in\\xa0 the second half of the year would\\xa0 be slightly weaker than in the first half. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters  Global IT group IBM will triple the number of its cloud data centres in Britain it said yesterday joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the EU. IBM said it would build four new data centres to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud. IBM Europe’s general manger for cloud services Sebastian Krause said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing. “UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation to be more flexible on their business model to have better insight for decision making and to deliver better customer service” he said in an interview. IBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June Brexit vote he said but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision. UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation “Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit” he said. Tech bosses have been balancing Britain’s enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent fuelled by world class universities against the uncertainty of the country’s future relationship with the EU and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc. Companies including Google and Facebook have decided the advantages outweigh the risks but they’ve emphasised the importance of being able to attract the best people. IBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centres to six serving customers such as travel group Thomson which is owned by TUI retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone and National Grid as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment. Brexit also creates uncertainty about Britain’s future compliance with European data protection rules which have recently been overhauled. Krause however said IBM was “well-equipped” for any post-Brexit scenario and it had 10 data centres in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Peter Nicholls/Reuters  British retailers reported their strongest sales in six months in August industry figures showed yesterday adding to signs that consumers are for now taking the country’s vote to leave the European Union in their stride. The Confederation of British Industry said its sales volume index rose to +9 its highest since February from an initial slump after the Brexit vote to -14 in July. Sales in September were expected to moderate. The expected sales index was +3 for next month up from -12 in August. The release was in keeping with recent data showing consumers shrugging off the shock Brexit vote with retail sales boosted by warm weather and by overseas buyers attracted by a cheaper pound. “While the fall in sterling has boosted visitor numbers to the UK it is likely to push up the price of imported goods over time which will mean households will be more likely to rein back spending on non-essentials” Anna Leach CBI head of economic analysis and surveys said. Price pressures in factories – which feed through into consumer prices – jumped in July as import prices rose at their fastest rate since 2011. Samuel Tombs an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said he still expected growth in overall spending to slow sharply. “Away from the high street there are clear signs that (consumer activity is)... slowing down – falling new car registrations and declining mortgage approvals show households are shying away from big-ticket purchases.” A survey on Wednesday showed the number of mortgages approved by British banks fell to its lowest in a year in July. So far most data has shown less of a negative impact on the economy from the Brexit decision than some of the dire predictions made by supporters of remaining in the EU. But Britain has yet to trigger the formal exit process that would start the two-year period for formal negotiations about the country’s future relationship with the EU leaving many companies uncertain about what Brexit will mean for them. The CBI said an index of orders placed with suppliers was -7 in August up from -34 in July and was expected to improve further next month. Investment intentions rose to +15 in August from their most recent previous reading of -13 in May. The survey was conducted between July 27 and August 12 and 131 firms took part. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Shutterstock  Big international banks are preparing to move some of their operations out of Britain in early 2017 due to the uncertainty over the country\\'s future relationship with the European Union a top banking official said. Writing in the Observer newspaper Anthony Browne the chief executive of lobby group the British Bankers\\' Association said the public and political debate was \"taking us in the wrong direction\" and businesses could not wait until the last minute. \"Most international banks now have project teams working out which operations they need to move to ensure they can continue serving customers the date by which this must happen and how best to do it\" said Browne. \"Their hands are quivering over the relocate button. Many smaller banks plan to start relocations before Christmas; bigger banks are expected to start in the first quarter of next year.\" Many of the world\\'s major banks have their European headquarters in Britain where the financial sector employs more than two million people and makes up almost 12 percent of the economy. Banks in London depend on a European \"passport\" to serve clients across the 28-country European Union from one base and lenders worry that this right will end after Brexit. Browne said while finance minister Philip Hammond and Brexit minister David Davis were \"making the right noises\" he was concerned that some high-profile Brexit supporters believed banks did not need passporting and could rely on so-called equivalence under which the EU can allow access to its markets for countries whose regulations are similar to the bloc\\'s. \"The EU\\'s equivalence regime is a poor shadow of passporting it only covers a narrow range of services can be withdrawn at virtually no notice and will probably mean the UK will have to accept rules it has no influence over\" he said. \"For most banks equivalence won’t prevent them from relocating their operations.\" Banks have already said they are making contingency plans to move some of their operations to continental Europe if Britain does not negotiate access to the EU single market after Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will trigger formal talks to leave the EU by the end of March 2017 after Britain voted to leave in a referendum last June. She has said she will fight to retain access to the single market but several EU leaders have insisted that will depend on Britain accepting free movement of workers from the EU - a condition Britain has vowed to curtail. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Shutterstock  Credit rating agency Standard & Poor\\'s has said it expects an eventual Brexit impact on Malta to be \"relatively contained\" with local economic growth outpacing the eurozone average.\\xa0 In a research update published today the agency affirmed Malta\\'s BBB+/A-2 rating as well as its positive outlook saying Malta had a \"one-in-three\" chance of getting a rating upgrade within the next 12 months.\\xa0 S&P said it expected the Maltese economy to grow by an average of 2.9 per cent a year between 2016 and 2019 with net government debt predicted to fall to 53 per cent by 2019 from last year\\'s 58 per cent figure.\\xa0 Economic growth the agency said would be fuelled by increased investment in the energy healthcare and education sectors combined with an increased capacity in the tourism and recreation sectors.\\xa0 Hourly wages had increased by an average of 3.5 per cent between 2013 and 2015 the agency said with S&P attributing this to \"a structural shift in the Maltese economy toward more labor-intensive higher-value added service-based sectors.\"\\xa0 Brexit impact S&P acknowledged the potential impact the UK leaving the EU could have on Malta\\'s tourism and financial services industry. It however said that the local tourism sector was facing supply constraints and would therefore be able to make up any shortfall in the medium term.\\xa0 The impacts a Brexit would have on the financial services industry were less clear S&P acknowledged.\\xa0 Malta-based investment funds could struggle to generate service exports if the UK\\'s asset management industry slowed down it said. That would affect Malta\\'s export growth but was unlikely to create balance-of-payment risks.\\xa0 \"On the other hand Malta-based banks that have significant exposure to the UK may experience a deterioration in their asset quality which would undermine their profitability and as a result nominal GDP growth in Malta\" it added.\\xa0 Overall S&P believed Malta would be able to weather a Brexit without any major economic shocks.\\xa0 Rating upgrade? The agency also dangled the carrot of a one-in-three chance of a rating upgrade within the next year. An upgrade it said was likely if medium-term growth continued without a return to current account deficits or if fiscal consolidation progressed at a faster clip than expected while contingent liability risks diminished. \\xa0 Finance Minister Edward Scicluna welcomed the report saying it found Malta to be \"broadly supportive of creditworthiness demonstrated by structural reforms that generated employment growth and elevated the potential growth of the economy.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The Prime Minister said there was consensus among the 27 member states over giving the UK some breathing space until the new prime minister is chosen. There was a more understanding attitude he said signaling a change from the \"arrogant\" tone displayed by some in the EU institutions in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. However Dr Muscat acknowledged that \"at the back of everybody\\'s minds\" was the unasked question whether the UK will really exit the EU. \"There are different scenarios but it would be pure speculation at this stage and everyone is making the assumption they will leave\" Dr Muscat said today at the end of a two-day summit that discussed Brexit. Today\\'s breakfast session that stretched beyond noon was held in the absence of the UK. European leaders have started drawing red lines on the terms for Brexit making it clear that if the UK wanted full access to the single market it would have to embrace the free movement of people. Curbing migration was a central plank of the Leave campaign that is at odds with the concept of free movement of people. The problem Dr Muscat said was that it was not yet clear what type of relationship the UK wanted. \"The relationship must be strong but the UK will not be given any special status and it will be treated as a third country during talks\" he said. No formal decision has been taken on what happens with the UK presidency of the EU in the second half of next year with the British prime minister yesterday saying he would like that decision to be taken by his successor.

Photo: Reuters  The introduction of post-Brexit customs checks could cost traders more than £4 billion a year according to a think tank report released yesterday. The British government has said it plans to leave the EU’s customs union when it leaves the bloc and it wants to negotiate a new relationship that will ensure trade is as free of friction as possible. In its report ‘Implementing Brexit: Customs’ the Institute for Government said the government needed to offer as much certainty as possible to business and help them plan for changes to customs. Around 180000 traders now operate only within the EU and face making customs declarations for the first time after Brexit. The government estimates an extra 200 million declarations a year will be made. Those declarations cost £20 to £45 each the IfG said putting the total additional cost at £4 billion to £9 billion. “The scale and cost of change for many traders could be significant. Government must engage with them in detail about changes understanding their requirements and giving them as much time to adapt as possible” the report said. The government has proposed two options for the future customs relationship. One is a system using technology to make the process as smooth as possible; the second a new customs partnership removing the need for a customs border. It wants a transition period after Britain leaves in March 2019 to allow time to adapt. However the EU says negotiating the customs relationship must wait until the two sides have made progress on the rights of expatriates Britain’s border with EU member Ireland and a financial settlement. “To be in and out of the customs union and ‘invisible borders’ is a fantasy” Guy Verhofstadt the European Parliament’s coordinator for Brexit said on Twitter after the British government floated its proposals. “First need to secure citizens rights and a financial settlement.” Moving customs requirements away from the physical border retaining access to key EU computer systems and setting up working groups with the private sector on implementing changes are among the report’s suggestions for smoothing the process. To avoid a cliff-edge the government must make sure everyone from port operators to freight companies and local authorities is ready the IfG said. It should also work with EU partners to ensure issues at European ports do not cause significant disruption to supply chains. “In the past they have been given years to adapt to any government change; they now have fewer than 20 months to prepare without yet being clear what they are preparing for” the report said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain will have even more money to spend on public services than the disputed €350 million a week Brexiteers promised after the country leaves the European Union Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said in an interview published on Tuesday. The £350 million figure was a central and controversial part of the pro-Leave campaign\\'s \"Take back control\" message in the runup to the 2016 referendum. Last September government statisticians accused Johnson of misusing state data by repeating it. Britain\\'s theoretical gross contribution to the EU in 2016 was £18.9 billion - more than £360 million per week - but this was automatically lowered to £13.9 billion by a rebate arrangement that has been in place since 1984. The government received a further £4.4 billion back to spend mostly on farm subsidies and infrastructure in poorer regions. Overall Britain\\'s net payment to the EU worked out at £181 million a week. Brexit opponents say Johnson and other pro-Leave campaigners deliberately misled the public by saying £350 million a week could be spent on the state-run National Health Service (NHS) a claim famously emblazoned on a campaign bus and it has become symbolic of the divisions caused by the referendum. But in the interview with the Guardian newspaper Johnson said the UK\\'s weekly gross contribution to the EU would rise to £438 million by the time Britain left the bloc. \"There was an error on the side of the bus\" Johnson said. \"We grossly underestimated the sum over which we would be able to take back control. As and when the cash becomes available – and it won\\'t until we leave – the NHS should be at the very top of the list.\" Johnson has previously said the £350 million figure on the bus referred to gross payments to the EU rather than the net amount. The opposition Labour Party said it had written to the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority asking it to make a statement about the accuracy of Johnson\\'s latest remarks. In the last week several senior Brexit campaigners such as Nigel Farage the former head of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) suggested there needed to be another referendum to reaffirm the 2016 result of 52-48 percent in favour of leaving the EU. Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out a re-run of the vote. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Britain needs to make clear to the European Union that it is prepared to go it alone if it fails to reach a satisfactory deal in Brexit talks former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said today. King - who said in December that Britain should leave the EU\\'s single market and possibly its customs union - said his country needed to be able to show that it had a clear plan of how it would manage without an EU trade deal. \"If you are going to have any successful negotiation you have got to have a fall-back position which the other side understands and believes is credible\" King said in a BBC radio interview to mark 10 years since the start of the global financial crisis. Britain is due to leave the EU in March 2019 and began its formal exit talks in June. Initial areas of disagreement include Britain\\'s financial liabilities the rights of EU citizens already living in Britain and border arrangements between the British province of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic an EU member. King said British policymakers had done too little to help people whose skills had become uncompetitive because of globalisation adding that high levels of immigration were partly to blame If Britain fails to reach a deal trade would be governed by the World Trade Organisation which allows both sides to impose import tariffs and customs checks and does not replicate existing agreements on sectors such as airlines and financial services. On Thursday King\\'s successor as BoE governor Mark Carney said Brexit worries were weighing on business investment and pay decisions and that sterling\\'s fall since the June 2016 Brexit vote was to blame for above-target inflation. In the BBC interview King said British policymakers had done too little to help people whose skills had become uncompetitive because of globalisation adding that high levels of immigration were partly to blame. \"Because we have had very large immigration into the UK employers in the UK have stopped investing in skills and training in Britain ... and the same is true in the US\" he said. \"These are problems we need to think quite deeply about.\" Restricting migration was a major reason many Britons voted for Brexit. But most British economists say the gains from free trade and EU migration significantly outweigh any costs. Previous BoE research has found that big increases in migration have a small negative impact on wages especially for workers in low-skilled service sector jobs. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The Chancellor will try to reassure bankers on Thursday that he will protect their interests as London leaves the EU with a major speech emphasising open trade and financial services industry relationships both with Europe and beyond. Philip Hammond the most pro-European of Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s top ministers will say he wants to see a liberalisation of cross-border financial services and for London to be the world\\'s \"undisputed gateway to financial markets\" in excerpts released by his office. \"While some question the benefits of openness ... being open to the world - and being a global capital of finance - will continue to be (the) foundation of the UK\\'s economic success\" Hammond will tell financial leaders at the City of London\\'s annual Mansion House dinner. The event is one of the major set pieces of the year for both Hammond and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney who will also speak. It comes a day after May won an important vote in parliament on her Brexit plans facing down rebels within her ruling Conservative Party who favour closer ties with the EU. Although Hammond is seen as a sceptic of a hard break with the EU the emphasis on global trade in the excerpts from his speech echoes a theme of more enthusiastic Brexit supporters among May\\'s Conservatives who say Britain can benefit from escaping the bloc to do trade deals with further-flung nations. Hammond will say that after Brexit he wants to strike fresh global financial partnerships based on new free trade deals and existing dialogue with countries like China and India. He will also reiterate that he wants the EU to discuss an ambitious future financial services relationship with Britain. Progress on this key demand of Britain\\'s financial sector has been slow. For months the government financial regulators and major banks in Britain have backed a \"mutual recognition\" blueprint for two-way market access after Brexit. But facing scepticism from Brussels financial executives told Reuters last week they no longer believe it is realistic. In a speech before Hammond\\'s the Lord Mayor of the City of London Charles Bowman a figurehead for the financial services industry plans to emphasise the industry\\'s desire for streamlined immigration procedures and a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU that covers financial services. \"We welcomed the government\\'s March announcement that there will be a transition period ... but even with this in place there are significant risks such as those around contract continuity and data flows that must be addressed.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May made a dramatic direct appeal to the British public to support her deal to exit the European Union on Sunday even as backing from her own party for the agreement appeared to elude her. May is meeting the other 27 EU leaders in Brussels this weekend to sign off on a divorce treaty and political declaration to end more than 40 years as part of the world\\'s biggest trading bloc. In an open letter to the nation May said she would campaign \"heart and soul\" to get her Brexit deal through Britain\\'s parliament - an increasingly unlikely prospect given stiff opposition from some of her own Conservative Party lawmakers and allies in Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) alike. \"It will be a deal that is in our national interest – one that works for our whole country and all of our people whether you voted \"Leave\" or \"Remain\" she said. Sunday newspapers said different factions in her own party were preparing alternative Brexit plans to keep Britain closer to the EU should her deal fail as most expect. That included a plan being hatched by close allies such as finance minister Philip Hammond and work and pensions minister Amber Rudd reported The Sunday Times without citing sources. The Sunday Telegraph said there were plans on both sides of the English Channel for a \"Plan B\". One such was a Norway-style relationship with Brussels under which Britain would have a more certain \"exit mechanism\" from the EU’s rules but would be unable to end the free movement of workers from the bloc - the most politically contentious element of Brexit. In her letter May urged Britons to start a new era of political unity when it leaves the EU on March 29 2019 and set aside the bitter fighting provoked by Brexit. \"I want that to be a moment of renewal and reconciliation for our whole country. It must mark the point when we put aside the labels of \"Leave\" and \"Remain\" for good and we come together again as one people\" she said. \"Parliament will have the chance to do that in a few weeks’ time when it has a meaningful vote on the deal.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s government was found in contempt of parliament on Tuesday for refusing to release its full legal advice on Brexit underlining the depth of opposition among lawmakers to her deal on leaving the European Union. The row threatened to overshadow the start of five days of debate in parliament on May\\'s Brexit deal ahead of a crucial vote on Dec. 11 when lawmakers will be asked to approve it. Opposition parties and the small Northern Irish party that props up May\\'s minority government are furious that it only provided an outline of the legal basis for its Brexit deal after parliament voted to be given the full advice. They put forward a motion which was backed by 311-293 in a vote on Tuesday that found ministers in contempt of parliament and ordered the immediate publication of the advice. \"Today\\'s finding of contempt is a badge of shame for this government. It is of huge constitutional and political significance\" Keir Starmer the opposition Labour Party\\'s Brexit spokesman said after the vote. \"Never before has the House of Commons found ministers in contempt of parliament.\" The sanctions ultimately available include suspending a lawmaker most likely Attorney General Geoffrey Cox. It was not clear whether the opposition parties would now push for that. Such punishment is usually reserved for backbench lawmakers guilty of individual wrongdoing. In reality Tuesday\\'s vote was about putting pressure on a weakened government. Catherine Haddon senior fellow at the Institute for Government said the opposition wanted to use \"every opportunity they have to show the instability of the government\". So many lawmakers - from May\\'s own Conservatives as well as from the opposition parties - have spoken out against the deal that the odds look stacked against her winning the Dec. 11 vote. Haddon said the contempt motion was a \"show of force\" which could foreshadow both the final vote on the deal and the various amendments lawmakers are trying to attach to it. Cox gave parliament an outline of his legal advice to the government on Monday. Andrea Leadsom Leader of the House of Commons said on Tuesday that this had been a \"full and frank exposition\" and that releasing the full advice would set a dangerous precedent. She said the government which had sought to slow down the process by referring the issue to parliament\\'s Committee of Privileges had fulfilled the spirit of the order to publish. The government said after the vote that it would now publish the full advice. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday she would be \"armed with a fresh mandate and new ideas\" when she meets European Union negotiators over her Brexit deal. EU officials have insisted that the deal is not open for renegotiation. But May wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that she would be \"battling for Britain and Northern Ireland\" in her efforts to get rid of the agreement\\'s unpopular backstop provision. \"If we stand together and speak with one voice I believe we can find the right way forward\" she said. The backstop is intended to ensure there is no return to a hard border with Ireland but Brexit supporters fear it will keep Britain tied to the EU\\'s customs rules. MPs voted last week to send May back to Brussels to renegotiate the clause suggesting her deal would then be able to pass after it was roundly rejected in parliament last month. \"I am now confident there is a route that can secure a majority in the House of Commons for leaving the EU with a deal\" she wrote. \"When I return to Brussels I will be battling for Britain and Northern Ireland I will be armed with a fresh mandate new ideas and a renewed determination to agree a pragmatic solution\". The EU insists that the deal \"remains the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal\" but with the clock running down until the March 29 exit date the risks of a no-deal Brexit for both Britain and the bloc are coming into sharp focus. May said opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn \"also believes the potential indefinite nature of the backstop is an issue\" and that the EU has \"already accepted the principle of \\'alternative arrangements\\' superseding the backstop should it ever be required.\" The backstop would kick in if Britain and the EU have not agreed a trade deal on their future relationship after a time-limited transition period of up to two years. The prime minister rejected accusations that plans to reopen the backstop talks risked upsetting the Irish peace process. \"Nor do I have time for those who believe the verdict passed by the British people in 2016 should be overturned before it is even implemented\" she added referring to the rump of MPs calling for a second referendum. \"I\\'m determined to deliver Brexit and determined to deliver on time –- on March 29 2019\" she wrote. May has promised MPs that she will bring any revised deal back to be voted on by MPs on February 13. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain wants to benefit from European Union trade deals and have a say over EU laws passed during its transition out of the bloc Brexit minister David Davis said on Friday seeking to defuse tension between senior ministers over the interim deal. Davis set out the government\\'s position on a transition period looking to offer something for both those who want to keep close ties with the European Union after leaving and those who want a more radical break. The balancing act designed to appease both business and Brexiteers is a taste of things to come for Prime Minister Theresa May who has been unable to prevent divisions in her party repeatedly spilling out into the open. On Thursday finance minister Philip Hammond was rebuked by May\\'s office after saying he hoped Britain would diverge from the EU only \"very modestly\" after Brexit. He spoke hours before the head of a hardline group of Brexiteer lawmakers urged May to stop accepting negotiating terms set by the EU. \"It’s only by being outside the EU but continuing with the existing structures of rules and regulation that we can meet the requirements for a smooth orderly and successful exit\" Davis said in a speech at Teesport in northeast England. \"The existing international agreements we are party to should continue to apply during this period. They are an important part of the existing EU structure of rules and regulations to which we will remain a party during the implementation period.\" WAY TO RESOLVE CONCERNS Davis also said there needed to be some mechanism for Britain to query new laws introduced during the transition period which it would be duty-bound to follow and that the future jurisdiction of regulators needed to be clarified. \"We will have to find a way to agree a way of resolving concerns if laws that are deemed to run contrary to our interests and we have not had our say\" he said. There is little distance between Britain and the EU to overcome to agree the transitional deal which will give the two sides time to prepare for the far-reaching impact of the end of more than 40 years of union. Davis said he expected a political agreement on the transition deal at an EU summit on March 22-23 - a target Brussels is also working towards with plans for fortnightly rounds of negotiations. The EU is willing to be flexible on the duration and other terms of a Brexit transition period which could include letting London sign trade deals according to a document due to be formally endorsed by EU ministers on Monday. Davis dismissed a question on whether he could really negotiate for Britain if senior members of the cabinet disagreed about what the transition deal should contain: \"There is no difference between the chancellor and myself and indeed the prime minister in terms of that we both want a Brexit which serves the British economy and serves the British people\" he said. But May who gambled on a snap election last year that cost her party its majority in parliament is facing pressure from multiple angles: pro-EU lawmakers hardline Brexiteers and another contingent who question her leadership credentials and criticise a \"dull dull dull\" domestic agenda. LETTERS OF NO CONFIDENCE Several newspaper reports have said the number of letters expressing \\'No Confidence\\' in the party leader is approaching the threshold of 48 required to trigger a leadership contest. The actual number is not made public by the party committee that holds them. May is aware that the plan to change little of the current relationship immediately after Britain formally leaves on March 29 2019 is fuelling anger among Brexit campaigners who fear their mantra of \"taking back control\" is being sold out. Jacob Rees-Mogg who heads a hardline group of pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers that could have enough members to topple May has said Britain must stop accepting negotiating terms set by the EU and that current transition plans would render it a \"vassal state\". The febrile mood in the party is likely to linger; May has had to struggle to keep her lawmakers united over everything from transition to the future relationship to the so-called Brexit dividend - the funds that will be freed up when Britain stops paying into EU coffers. But Davis said the prospect of an independent trade policy was worth waiting for. \"We must keep sight of the fact that this is a bridge to a new future partnership\" he said. \"... where crucially the United Kingdom is outside of the single market and outside of the customs union; where the United Kingdom courts are sovereign once more; and where the United Kingdom can take advantage of its status as an independent trading nation.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The European Union\\'s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told Britain on Monday that the time had come for Britain to make a choice on what sort of relationship it wanted with the bloc after Brexit. Britain has ruled out staying in any customs union with the EU after Brexit but the nature of its trading relationship with the world\\'s biggest trading bloc has split Theresa May\\'s government and Conservative Party. Barnier speaking after talks in Downing Street with Prime Minister May and Brexit Secretary David Davis bluntly called on Britain to clarify how it saw the future relationship with the EU after it leaves on March 29 2019. \"The only thing I can say: without a customs union and outside the single market barriers to trade and goods and services are unavoidable\" Barnier told reporters in Downing Street. \"Time has come to make a choice.\" \"We need also clarity on the UK proposals for the future partnership\" Barnier said. Britain Davis said wanted a comprehensive free trade agreement and a customs agreement to make trade as frictionless as possible while being free to strike free trade deals with swiftly growing countries across the world. Davis said the talks with Barnier had been constructive and that he was confident Britain could get agreement on a time-limited transition period by the March economic council which is scheduled for March 13. With little more than a year left before Britain\\'s March 2019 exit from the European Union May\\'s party remains deeply divided over what sort of relationship should be built between the EU and the world\\'s sixth-largest economy. Such are the divisions within May\\'s government that the debate over the extent of Britain\\'s possible post-Brexit participation in an EU customs union has taken place in public with key ministers offering a range of views. \"The conditions are clear: Everyone has to play by the same rules during this transition\" Barnier said. \"The certainty about the transition will only come with the ratification of the withdrawal agreement.\" BREXIT TARIFFS? Membership of the or a customs union after Brexit would prevent London from striking trade deals with countries outside the EU in future. While May has repeatedly said that Britain will leave the customs union some ministers hope that Britain could remain in some sort of bespoke customs arrangement with the EU after Brexit. May\\'s spokesman told reporters that Britain would leave the customs union and would not be a member of a customs union with the EU after Brexit. \"We are very keen that we continue to have an extremely good and close relationship that relationship be on economic and other grounds and that it will continue in long term\" Davis said. \"It\\'s perfectly clear what we want to do and there is no doubt about it\" Davis said. Negative news around Brexit negotiations and surveys indicating a slowing British economy are sapping investor confidence in sterling with it dipping 0.8 percent to $1.4005 on Monday its lowest since January 30. A customs union means that its members apply the same tariff to goods imported into their territory from elsewhere and apply no tariffs to goods from other members. It also limits checks and other bureaucracies at borders between members. Unless Britain negotiates a new trade deal with the EU its exports would run into the union\\'s external tariffs which average about 5 percent across all goods including 10 percent for cars and over 200 percent on certain types of poultry. But May is under pressure from eurosceptic members in her party to quit the trading arrangement because for them the key prize is chance to sign new trade deals with other nations such as the United States China and India. May will hold two cabinet meetings on Wednesday and Thursday at which she will try to heal the deep divisions among her ministers over the best way to leave the EU. If no deal is reached by October of this year many businesses fear Britain could face a disorderly exit that would weaken the West disrupt the peace in Northern Ireland imperil Britain’s $2.7 trillion economy and undermine London’s position as the only financial centre to rival New York. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Here’s how Brexit could effect the UK’s most important meal of the day. Let’s start with the good news. The British egg industry can produce enough for the country to be entirely self-sufficient in eggs. In light of the recent scare concerning contaminated eggs imported from Dutch farms it is unnecessary (other than for cost reasons) for UK supermarkets to use cheaper foreign-sourced eggs for processed products. So if you fancy eggs for breakfast Brexit is unlikely to have any effect on this staple. Bread is made from wheat and about 85% of the wheat used by UK flour millers is home grown. The majority of the flour produced in the UK is also used there. Only about 1% of UK flour sales are based on imports of flour whereas about 2% is exported. Canadian wheat is imported due to its excellent characteristics which work well blended with UK wheats. Depending on the quality of the UK crop wheat may also be imported from France and Germany. So unless you are after a croissant which requires the softer French wheat your breakfast toast should not be affected by Brexit. Now for the less good news. Britain’s breakfast sausages and bacon are dependent on the availability and cost of pork. British farmers currently produce only 40% of the pork eaten in the UK. The other 60% comes from EU countries such as Denmark Germany and the Netherlands. European producers are able to provide pork more cheaply than British farmers who have additional costs related to higher animal welfare standards – 40% of the British pig herd is bred outdoors. So a hard Brexit would probably lead to a rise in the cost of sausages and bacon until such a time as the British pork industry recovers sufficiently to supply enough happy pigs. Although the UK still ranks number 11 in the world among potato-producing countries the harvested area has shrunk by half since 1960 and demand exceeds supply. Mediterranean countries are often the largest source of fresh potato imports to the UK. These usually include new potatoes from both EU and non-EU countries (such as Israel) as well as potatoes from the near continent (principally Holland Belgium and France). Frozen processed potatoes account for the largest proportion of UK imports. Average prices are lower for imported frozen products than those domestically produced with the majority of frozen potato imports coming from the Netherlands and Belgium. This means that if your hash browns come in frozen form Brexit could make them more expensive. Mushrooms are a relatively new crop in the UK and the industry itself is young dominated by a single species of mushroom. Mushrooms which can be grown in the UK have seen massive drops in production due to the industry being dominated by a few big companies. The production area of mushrooms has decreased since 2007 from 126 to 86 hectares. One company based in Ireland dominates production and mushroom growers in Ireland rely on the UK for 80% of sales. Other countries that export mushrooms to the UK are Poland Belgium and the Netherlands. Recently G’s Growers Ltd an independent Producer Organisation has made a major investment in a new mushroom growing facility in Cambridgeshire in response to demand for UK-grown mushrooms. But to complicate matters the mushroom industry in the UK employs predominantly Eastern European pickers. This indicates that Brexit will have a double-edged effect on mushrooms with increased prices and shortages due to availability of labour.   Read more: Who picked British fruit and veg before migrant workers?   And now for some really bad news. Tomatoes grow where it is hot and require a long growing season. To combat its climate the British tomato industry has more than 200 hectares of glasshouses. Despite this British tomato production amounts to only about a fifth of the total volume of tomatoes sold in the country each year. About 400000 tonnes of fresh tomatoes are imported from EU countries such as Spain the Netherlands Poland Italy and Belgium and non-EU countries such as Morocco and Israel. The UK is nowhere near tomato self-sufficiency and a hard Brexit would definitely mean more expensive tomatoes. Beans – haricot navy or phaseolus vulgaris – cannot be grown in Britain. They are all imported – mostly from North America although scientists are mapping DNA in an attempt to create a strain that will survive in the UK. Breakfast favourite baked beans require haricot beans. People in the UK consume about 2000 tonnes of baked beans every year. But baked beans aren’t just beans. They also contain a spice mixture tomato sauce starch sugar and vinegar. So although Brexit may not have a direct impact on imports from North America the fact that baked beans contain tomatoes could influence their price. So if you can reduce your breakfast to just eggs and toast you might not even notice Brexit. But if you want that full English medley Brexit may not be your cup of tea.

President Donald Trump said on Friday he had a very strong relationship with British Prime Minister Theresa May having earlier scorned her Brexit strategy which he said had probably killed off hope for a future US-British trade deal. In an interview published just hours before he was due to have lunch with May and tea with Queen Elizabeth on Friday Trump chided the \"very unfortunate\" results of the prime minister\\'s strategy for negotiating Britain\\'s departure from the European Union. \"If they do a deal like that we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK so it will probably kill the deal\" Trump told the Rupert Murdoch-owned Sun newspaper. \"I would have done it much differently\" he told The Sun which urged its readers to back Brexit before a referendum in June 2016. \"I actually told Theresa May how to do it but she didn\\'t listen to me.\" Trump also heaped praise on Boris Johnson who resigned as foreign secretary this week along with Brexit Secretary David Davis in protest at May\\'s strategy. Johnson the president said \"would be a great prime minister\". No sitting US president has ever made such biting public criticism of a British prime minister while visiting and his comments undermined May in her party her country and abroad. But as the leaders met for talks at May\\'s official country residence Chequers both tried to play down the president\\'s intervention made a few hours after the formal publication of May\\'s plan in the Brexit debate. \"We really have a very good relationship\" Trump said. \"Today we are talking trade and we are talking military.\" Asked by a U.S. reporter if he regretted his comments to the Sun Trump looked away and shook his head. \"We\\'ve got a lot to discuss\" May said adding they would talk about the British-US \"special relationship\" and opportunities for a trade deal.  POUND DROPS Sterling fell half a percent to a 1 1/2-week low of $1.3131 partly on Trump\\'s comments in the newspaper interview. \"Where are your manners Mr President?\" asked Sam Gyimah a junior minister in May\\'s government. As Britain prepares to leave the EU on March 29 2019 supporters of Brexit have made much of the so-called special relationship with the United States and the benefits of forging closer trade ties with the world\\'s biggest economy. Many have cast May\\'s plan as a betrayal including lawmakers in her deeply divided Conservative Party who have warned that she might face a leadership challenge. On a visit to London two months before the 2016 Brexit referendum former U.S. President Barack Obama said Britain would be at the \"back of the queue\" for a trade deal if it departed the EU an intervention condemned by those backing the \\'Leave\\' campaign such as Johnson. However Jacob Rees-Mogg - a leading Conservative Brexiteer and considered a potential alternative party leader by some - said it was perfectly reasonable for Trump to make such comments adding that May now had an opportunity to change her mind on her Brexit plan. Still Trump\\'s comments upset even some who were in favour of the visit. \"What he has done and in particular for me the condescending nature of his comments towards the prime minister ... are unacceptable undiplomatic and counterproductive\" Simon Fraser a former top official at the UK Foreign Office told Sky News. Demonstrators protest against the visit of US President Donald Trump in central London. TRUMP PROTESTS For supporters Trump and Brexit offer the prospect of breaking free from what they see as obsolete institutions and rules. But for many British diplomats Brexit marks the collapse of a 70-year strategy of trying to balance European integration with a U.S. alliance based on blood trade and intelligence sharing. Trump has frequently angered British politicians. Late last year May criticised him for retweeting a message by a member of a British far-right group and the speaker of parliament has said Trump would not be welcome to address the chamber. Thousands of protesters massed in central London for a noisy demonstration against Trump one of the more than 100 rallies expected during his four-day visit. Protesters flew a blimp depicting the U.S. president as an orange snarling baby outside the British parliament. \"It\\'s embarrassing how much our government is falling over themselves to try to appease someone who has no interest in any sort of give-and-take in the UK-U.S. relationship at all\" said protester Nicola Tanner 33 from Bristol southwest England. On Thursday May invoked World War Two leader Winston Churchill as she addressed Trump and business leaders at a lavish dinner in his honour at Blenheim Palace the 18th century country house where Churchill was born. \"Mr. President Sir Winston Churchill once said that \\'to have the United States at our side was to me the greatest joy\\'\" May told Trump according to a text of her speech. She said the United States was \"not just the closest of allies but the dearest of friends\". While Trump\\'s trip was not a full state visit he has been given red carpet treatment including marching military bands. He is scheduled to have tea with Queen Elizabeth at Windsor Castle where her grandson Prince Harry married U.S. actress Meghan Markle in May. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Updated at 6.55pm Prime Minister Theresa May to win a vote of no confidence triggered by angry Brexit supporters in her Conservative Party on Wednesday but said she would step down as leader before the next election in four years time. Less than four months before the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29 Britain\\'s exit is in chaos with options ranging from a potentially disorderly no-deal departure to another referendum that could reverse it. May said she would fight for her job with everything she had. But at a closed meeting with Conservative lawmakers before they were due to decide her fate she announced she would not take the party into the next election due in 2022 two lawmakers present told reporters. \"She said that she did not intend to lead us into the 2022 election\" lawmaker Alec Shelbrooke said adding \"her opening remarks were \\'I am not going to hold a snap election\\'.\" Lawmakers said she told them she recognised that the party did not want her to lead them into the next election a gesture that could help her win over some wavering MPs on Wednesday evening. May could be toppled if a simple majority of 317 Conservative MPs (members of parliament) vote against her though a large rebellion could also leave her fatally weakened. At least 189 indicated public support for her and one bookmaker had the odds she would win at 89%. A bitter division over Europe in the Conservatives helped bring about the downfall of all three previous Conservative premiers - David Cameron John Major and Margaret Thatcher. May 62 who voted to remain in the EU at a 2016 referendum told opponents of her EU withdrawal deal - struck after two years of negotiations - that if they toppled her then Brexit would be delayed or stopped. \"A change of leadership in the Conservative Party now would put our country\\'s future at risk and create uncertainty when we can least afford it\" she said. \"I stand ready to finish the job.\" May said a new leader would not have time to renegotiate Brexit and secure parliamentary approval by the end of March meaning the Article 50 withdrawal notice would have to be extended or rescinded. The Conservative lawmakers will cast their votes in the confidence ballot from 1800 GMT in Committee Room 14 at the House of Commons. An announcement is due at 2100. \\'Size matters\\' \"The size of the vote does matter\" said polling expert John Curtice. \"If much more than 100 MPs vote against her then I think she is going to be struggling to remain for very long and would find it difficult to get that deal through the House of Commons.\" Brexit is Britain\\'s most significant political and economic decision since World War Two though pro-Europeans fear it will weaken the West as it grapples with the presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China. The outcome will shape Britain\\'s $2.8 trillion economy have far reaching consequences for UK unity and determine whether London keeps its place as one of the top two global financial centres. The British pound rose to 1.2652 against the US dollar. May won the top job in the turmoil that followed the 2016 EU referendum but promised to implement Brexit as a way to heal a divided nation. But on Monday she pulled a parliamentary vote on her deal - which seeks to keep Britain closely aligned with the EU after exit - to avoid defeat. Her trade minister Liam Fox said the government might not even put it to a vote unless the EU gave more reassurances on the so-called Irish \"backstop\" an insurance policy aimed at preventing border controls on the island of Ireland. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also said the 27 other bloc members would not change the deal. Pro-Brexit hardliners in her party say May has betrayed the people\\'s vote in negotiations while other critics say she struck a deal that is the worst of all worlds - out of the EU but with no say over rules it has to abide by. \"Theresa May\\'s plan would bring down the government if carried forward\" lawmakers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker said in a statement. \"Conservatives must now answer whether they wish to draw ever closer to an election under Mrs May’s leadership. In the national interest she must go.\" Party divisions May\\'s predecessor Cameron bet all on the referendum he lost in 2016. Now having already been weakened by a snap election last year which cost her a parliamentary majority May also sees her own job at risk over Europe. A former Bank of England employee and daughter of a Church of England pastor May has been widely praised for a punishing work ethic and dedication to duty but her premiership has been characterised by obduracy in the face of crises. Ministers said changing leader at such an important moment in British history was folly. \"I am absolutely sure the prime minister will win\" said Michael Gove the most senior Brexiteer in May\\'s government. But as investors and company bosses tried to gauge the ultimate outcome of the political crisis some were betting Brexit would be thwarted. The EU\\'s top court ruled on Monday that Britain could cancel its Article 50 notice to leave without permission from other members and without losing privileges. But if May\\'s deal fails in parliament and Brexit is not delayed then Britain could be heading towards a disorderly exit that investors fear will clog the arteries of trade dislocate supply chains and roil markets. \"We are working hard to make sure we get an orderly Brexit\" said Merkel the EU\\'s most powerful leader. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Video: UK parliament TV  Updated at 7pm\\xa0 British MPs on Friday rejected Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s EU divorce deal for a third time opening the way for a long delay to Brexit -- or a chaotic \"no deal\" withdrawal in two weeks. The pound slipped as lawmakers defied May\\'s plea to end the deadlock that has plunged Britain into a deep political crisis defeating her withdrawal agreement by 344 votes to 286. Britain had been due to leave the EU on Friday the long-heralded March 29 \"Independence Day\" but with paralysis in parliament May asked European leaders last week for a little more time. She now faces having to explain what happens next after EU Council President Donald Tusk immediately called a Brussels summit for April 10. The EU has set a deadline of April 12 for a decision with two likely options: Britain leaves with no deal at all or agrees a lengthy extension to allow time for a new approach. The prime minister has said it would be \"unacceptable\" to ask voters to take part in European Parliament elections in May three years after they voted in a 2016 referendum to leave the EU. MPs have repeatedly rejected a \"no-deal\" outcome fearing catastrophe if Britain severs ties with its closest trading partner with no plan in place. However this is still the default legal option and the European Commission said after Friday\\'s vote that this remained the \"likely scenario\". In view of the rejection of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons I have decided to call a European Council on 10 April. #Brexit This was echoed by the French presidency which said London must \"urgently present an alternative plan in the next few days\". German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas added: \"We are running out of time to prevent a disorderly Brexit.\" Election talk\\xa0Thousands of flag-waving protesters gathered outside parliament on Friday to accuse MPs of betraying Brexit holding up signs saying \"Give Our kingdom back\" and \"Free Britain now\". Inside May said she would keep pressing for an \"orderly Brexit\" but added: \"The implications of the house\\'s decision are grave.\" The prime minister had offered to quit if MPs backed the deal but while some of her critics fell in behind her 34 of the 314 MPs in her Conservative party still rebelled. Theresa May wraps up the debate with the Speaker subsequently calling a division. Video: UK parliament TV \"I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this house\" she said. Her comments sparked speculation she might call an election as the only way to break the impasse something opposition parties have called for. But her spokesman said she did not believe this would be \"in the interests of the country\". May\\'s authority lies in tatters after weeks of turmoil but officials have hinted she might yet try to bring the deal back to MPs for a fourth and final time. Her spokesman noted the numbers against the deal were falling from a majority of 230 in January to 149 earlier this month and now 58 adding: \"We are at least going in the right direction.\" MPs can end this nightmare\\xa0 The failure by parliament to agree the terms of Brexit has left businesses unable to plan even a few weeks ahead. \"We are running out of words to express how sick business leaders are of being stuck in this spirit-sapping limbo\" said Edwin Morgan interim chief of the Institute of Directors. May has blamed MPs but they say it is her refusal to change course that is blocking any solution. \"It is clear that this House does not support the deal... and if the prime minister can\\'t accept that then she must go\" opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said. Brexit supporters rallied outside the House of Commons. Photo: AFP Tired of waiting MPs this week gave themselves unprecedented powers to vote on various options for Britain\\'s future relationship with the EU. A proposal for a new customs union got close to passing in a first round as did a plan for a referendum on May\\'s deal with more voting planned next Monday and Wednesday. \"Only MPs can end this nightmare for businesses\" said Josh Hardie of the CBI business lobby group. The risk that MPs decide to agree closer ties to the EU or even stop Brexit altogether persuaded some proponents to reluctantly back May\\'s deal. They included some of her staunchest critics such as former foreign minister Boris Johnson -- a leading contender to replace her -- and MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. But May\\'s Northern Irish allies the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) still held out saying planned arrangements to keep open the Irish border after Brexit remained unacceptable. \"We are not prepared to see our constitutional position altered by Brussels in a fit of pique for daring to leave the EU\" said MP Sammy Wilson the DUP\\'s Brexit spokesman.

British MPs will attempt to chart a new Brexit path on Monday after rejecting Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit deal for a third time leaving her strategy in tatters and the country in limbo. With less than two weeks to go until the day Britain risks crashing out of the European Union MPs will hold a series of votes to try and find a majority-backed plan to end the current crisis. Britain voted by 52 percent to leave the EU in a 2016 referendum but the process has been mired in divisions between Brexit supporters over the terms of the divorce and what kind of future ties to seek. The government struck a deal with the EU in November but parliament has refused to ratify it forcing the government to seek a delay to the originally planned departure date of March 29. The EU\\'s offer of an extension until May 22 was conditional on MPs approving the deal last week. Despite May\\'s promise to step down if they voted for the deal -- an attempt to get Brexit hardliners to vote for it -- they failed to do so. - No more delay -The government must now make a new request to the European Union at an extraordinary summit on April 10 or leave the bloc without a deal on April 12 with potentially chaotic economic consequences. A longer delay beyond May 22 would have the bizarre consequence of Britain having to hold European Parliament elections like other member states. Parliament seized the initiative for one day last week but failed to unite around a single option that could replace May\\'s deal. But there appears to be momentum behind a plan to seek a deal that would see Britain stay in some kind of customs union with the European Union. While this may satisfy the pro-EU members of May\\'s cabinet it threatens mass rebellion among the rest of her ministers posing a serious threat to the government\\'s survival. Brexit-supporting minister Andrea Leadsom has organised a letter signed by 10 cabinet members demanding that there be no further extension beyond May 22 the Sunday Telegraph reported. The letter also spells out that May must stand by her party\\'s manifesto pledge to leave the customs union in order to be able to strike post-Brexit trade deals with other countries. - General election threat -Agreeing to seek a customs union if demanded by MPs could therefore trigger a mass ministerial walkout. But so could ignoring MPs\\' instructions with pro-EU ministers having already quit to vote against the government. All of which leaves a general election looking ever more likely with May herself last week warning after the third rejection of her deal that \"I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House.\"\\xa0 But Conservative MPs across the board said they would block such a move which requires two-thirds support in parliament. Polling on Sunday signalled why. The party has slipped 7 percent according to the Mail on Sunday putting Jeremy Corbyn\\'s Labour on course to be the largest party if an election were held. Conservative Party deputy chairman James Cleverly said on Sunday that the party was not preparing for a snap election. \"I don\\'t think an election would solve anything. Time is of the essence we have got Brexit to deliver. We don\\'t want to add any more unnecessary delay\" he told Sophy Ridge on Sky News. The slip in support coincides with the party\\'s failure to deliver Brexit on March 29 upsetting its supporters who voted heavily in favour of leaving the EU. The poll also found narrow support for a second referendum. May is also facing mass calls from her own MPs to quit immediately as leader of the party -- and country -- rather than wait until the divorce phase of Brexit has been resolved as promised. She has yet to give up on her deal despite it being rejected three times by parliament and is reportedly considering whether to bring it back for a fourth vote potentially this week. Up to now we know what the British parliament says no to but we do not know what it says yes to- Juncker European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said the EU is \"running out\" of patience with Britain over Brexit. \"With our British friends we have had a lot of patience but even patience is running out\" Juncker told Italian public TV channel Rai 1 on Sunday. \"I would like in the coming hours and days for Great Britain to reach an agreement on the way forward. \"Up to now we know what the British parliament says no to but we do not know what it says yes to\" Juncker said. Asked about the matter of a second referendum -- an option demanded by many of those who would prefer to remain in the EU -- Juncker said that \"it is something that concerns the British only\".\\xa0 \"They have to decide which instruments they will use to reach the end of this process.\"\\xa0 \\xa0 Comedian heads to run-off against incumbent for Ukraine presidency Pope rounds off Morocco visit with Mass for thousands \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

File photo: Sean Azzopardi  Despite the humiliating rejection of Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit deal Britain is no closer to knowing the end result of its vote to leave the European Union. A raft of amendments to be voted on by MPs on Tuesday threaten to further muddy the waters as the clock ticks down to Britain\\'s scheduled departure from the EU on March 29. Three ultimate scenarios remain - leaving without an official deal leaving with a very similar deal or no Brexit at all. But each path is fraught with uncertainty political volatility constitutional logjams and an increasingly embittered electorate. Here are the potential next steps: No deal Britain is legally on track to leave the EU with or without a deal on March 29 unless it delays or stops the process. A no-deal scenario threatens to trigger a recession in Britain and markedly slow the EU\\'s economic growth as well as causing significant legal disruption. The world\\'s fifth-biggest economy could lose preferential access to its largest export market overnight affecting every sector leading to rising costs and disruption at British ports. As D-Day looms the government has conducted visible displays of its ramped-up no-deal preparations over the past few weeks. But speculation is growing that the government under pressure from parliament could seek to delay the process and take no-deal off the table. Delay Some amendments introduced in parliament are seeking to delay Britain\\'s departure date although all the other 27 EU countries would have to agree. A potential complication is that elections to the European Parliament are due in late May and the new chamber is set to sit on July 2. Some of Britain\\'s 73 seats have already been reallocated. A delay to give May time to pass legislation enshrining her Brexit deal would likely command widespread support said leading pollster John Curtice. But Brexit supporters would be deeply opposed to a delay motivated by a desire \"to go away and have a referendum or a general election or softer Brexit\" he added. Brussels also may not be so keen if the delay would simply translate into more months of political gridlock. Second referendum Growing numbers of MPs are seeking a new referendum to reverse the 2016 result when the Leave campaign won by 52 per cent to 48 per cent. But supporters admit they do not currently have the numbers in parliament to make it happen. No law prevents Britain from doing it all over again but many question whether a revote would be democratic - or resolve anything. May has warned that another vote \"would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics\". It also threatens to be just as divisive as the last one with opinion polls showing the country is still split over the issue. Try to get another deal After MPs overwhelmingly rejected the deal agreed between May and Brussels she held talks with lawmakers across parliament as well as business figures and trade unions to try to find a way through. The key sticking point is the deal\\'s \"backstop\" solution to keep the Irish border open which has the potential to leave Britain indefinitely tied to some form of EU customs union. Influential Brexit supporters say that with changes to the backstop they could support the agreement. EU leaders have said they are willing to talk further including on plans for the future trading relationship but have repeatedly said they do not want to reopen the deal itself. General election Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn sought to oust May\\'s government by calling a confidence vote after her Brexit deal was defeated but she won. There is a risk that her Conservative party and their Northern Irish allies the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) could turn against her if she pursues either a \"softer\" or a no-deal Brexit. But if not the only other way to force an election is for the prime minister herself to gamble and call a snap vote to break the impasse. No Brexit  Some lawmakers favour the nuclear option of cancelling Brexit altogether despite the threat of widespread public rage. Finance minister Philip Hammond even told business leaders last week that Article 50 could be rescinded. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May said she had made \"progress\" in talks with the EU on Wednesday as she sought to extract concessions on the terms of Britain\\'s divorce but as expected there was no major breakthrough. With less than six weeks until Brexit day May met European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker hoping for movement on the \"Irish backstop\" issue -- after EU leaders insisted they would not restart negotiations. Fears are growing that Britain could yet crash out without a deal and there was fresh drama just before May headed to Brussels as three of her MPs resigned from her Conservative party in protest over Brexit to join a new independent group of lawmakers. Citing the risk of a \"hard\" Brexit ratings agency Fitch on Wednesday warned it could downgrade Britain while the pound slipped against the US dollar. A joint statement from May and Juncker called their meeting \"constructive\" striking a slightly more positive tone than when they met a fortnight ago. \"The two leaders agreed that talks had been constructive and they urged their respective teams to continue to explore the options in a positive spirit\" the statement said. Separately May said she had stressed the need for \"legally binding changes to the backstop\" -- though the EU has ruled this out. \"We’ve agreed that work to find a solution will continue at pace time is of the essence and it’s in both our interests that when the UK leaves the EU it does so in an orderly way. And so we’ve made progress\" May said. May and the other 27 EU leaders approved a Brexit withdrawal agreement at a summit on November 25 last year but the British leader\\'s own parliament rejected it overwhelmingly on January 15. Since then May and her ministers have repeatedly met EU leaders and their negotiator Michel Barnier to urge them to reopen the text to find a way to appease eurosceptic MPs. - \\'Backstop\\' stumbling block -The main stumbling block has been the Irish backstop which provides for Britain to remain in the EU customs union until a way is found -- such as a future free trade deal -- to ensure that Ireland\\'s border with Northern Ireland remains open. Brexiteers in May\\'s own Conservative party see this as a \"trap\" to keep Britain tied to the bloc indefinitely and have demanded a time limit or exit clause. But such a clause would be seen in Brussels as a betrayal of EU member Ireland and has consistently been given short shrift by EU officials. May and Juncker\\'s statement indicated a fresh push to see what guarantees the EU could offer on the backstop to convince sceptical MPs it will not be used to trap Britain. It also suggested the political declaration outlining plans for future EU-UK ties could be beefed up to \"increase confidence\" that both sides will try to reach a future deal as soon as possible so the backstop never has to be used. May said her Brexit Minister Stephen Barclay and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox would be back in Brussels on Thursday -- just three days since their last visit -- as the pace of negotiations picks up. A European source said Cox whose legal analysis of May\\'s deal confirmed Brexiteer fears will have a key role to play.\\xa0 If Brussels does enough on the backstop to persuade Cox to soften his advice it could help swing the parliamentary arithmetic behind the prime minister. Without a deal Britain is due to leave the Union abruptly after four decades on March 29 with no follow-on agreement or transition period to manage trade and economic relations. Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will meet Barnier on Thursday. Officials in both Brussels and London have played down talk that an EU-Arab League summit in Egypt this weekend could become a \"Brexit in the desert\" meet insisting the issue would not hijack the gathering. - Economic chaos feared -Both sides have said they want to avoid a no deal Brexit and many experts foresee economic chaos even warning of food and medicine shortages or a renewed threat of unrest in Northern Ireland. Manufacturing supply chains could be disrupted and Brexit uncertainty has already been cited as a contributing factor in the closure or departure of several British-based businesses. On the EU side the commission on Wednesday published an update on its no-deal planning with seven out of 19 legal proposals to mitigate the effects now approved. One option to avoid no deal would be for Brussels to accord Britain an extension to the March 29 deadline although May insists she will not request a delay. \\xa0 A delay could keep Britain inside the EU for May 23-26 elections for a new European Parliament which will start sitting from July 2 presumably without any British members. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39   \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Joseph Muscat on Monday discussed the Brexit process with UK Prime Minister Theresa May in London. The meeting focussed on a UK request for another delay in Britain\\'s departure date from the EU to June 30. Discussed #Brexit with @theresa_may to better understand UK request for further extension. Implementation of ‘sincere cooperation’ pledge will be an important component of #EUCO decision -JM A decision will be taken when EU heads of government meet on Wednesday. Theresa May on Monday started a last-minute flurry of European diplomacy that includes visits to Paris and Berlin.\\xa0 She had phone calls on Monday with EU Council president Donald Tusk and European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. May is due to visit German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday. Faced with political deadlock in London the EU agreed last month to postpone Brexit from March 29 to April 12 and May will formally ask at a special summit on Wednesday for it to be pushed back again to June 30. All other 27 EU leaders must agree and most seem ready to accept the idea of another delay to avoid a harmful \"no deal\" Brexit but likely for a much longer period than Britain has asked for. UK sets date for European Parliament elections In anticipation of this May\\'s government on Monday reluctantly laid the legal order needed to hold European Parliament elections on May 23. But May is hoping that EU leaders might agree to a flexible delay proposed by Tusk whereby Britain could leave earlier if it agrees a divorce deal and never hold the elections. \"It does not make these elections inevitable as leaving the EU before the date of election automatically removes our obligation to take part\" a spokeswoman said. European leaders have also asked May to come up with a reason for a delay with France in particular warning that it does not want simply to prolong the uncertainty. After MPs rejected her divorce deal for a third time May last week approached main opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to try to find a compromise. But Corbyn said Monday that he was still waiting for her to alter her approach. \"Talks have to mean a movement and so far there has been no change in those red lines\" he said adding that his team would speak to her ministers on Tuesday. - Sincere cooperation -May says she is determined to implement the 2016 referendum vote for Brexit but that Britain should only sever ties with its largest trading partner once it has new arrangements in place. Her decision to meet with Corbyn has sparked fury in her own Conservative party with former foreign minister and leading Brexit supporter Boris Johnson warning against any \"surrender\". Labour wants a new customs union with the EU something May has previously rejected as it would stop Britain striking its own global trade deals. But in a video-message on Sunday she said: \"The longer this takes the greater the risk of the UK never leaving at all.\" In Dublin Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar expressed optimism about the cross-party process as he met with the EU\\'s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. \"We\\'re open to extending the deadline to allow these discussions to run their course\" he said. But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte who also spoke to May on Monday said it was \"crucial to know when and on what basis the UK will ratify the withdrawal agreement\". He tweeted that any Brexit delay would require \"assurances from the UK on sincere cooperation\". May used that phrase in her letter to Tusk saying Britain would continue to act as a \"constructive and responsible\" member state while it remained part of the bloc. - Political changes -Labour is pressing for changes to a political declaration on Britain\\'s future relationship with the EU which accompanies the withdrawal deal. Barnier repeated that this could be reworked \"extremely quickly\". Corbyn said May\\'s government had been open to the idea \"but they haven\\'t said in which way\". He added: \"We are looking for movement. We do not want to see a crashing out of the EU with no deal.\" The EU has by contrast refused to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement itself which includes controversial plans to keep open the Irish border. Barnier repeated his warning to hardline Brexiteers that in the case of a no-deal Brexit the EU would not start trade talks until the Irish issue was resolved.

Britons could pay to retain the benefits of European Union citizenship after Brexit under plans being considered by MEPs. The European Parliament\\'s lead Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt said he supported the principle of the idea which would see UK citizens sending an annual fee to Brussels. The former Belgian prime minister said Britons who voted Remain did not want to sever their links to the EU. \"Many say \\'we don\\'t want to cut our links\\'\" he told The Times. \"I like the idea that people who are European citizens and saying they want to keep it have the possibility of doing so. As a principle I like it.\" MEPs will vote on the proposals by the end of the year but any Brexit deal with the UK would have to have the agreement of the leaders of the other 27 EU nations as well as the parliament. Brexit-backing Tory MP Andrew Bridgen warned that Brussels would attempt anything to prevent the UK leaving the the EU. He told the newspaper: \"It\\'s an attempt to create two classes of UK citizen and to subvert the referendum vote. \"The truth is that Brussels will try every trick in the book to stop us leaving.\" It\\'s an attempt to create two classes of UK citizen and to subvert the referendum vote Meanwhile the Scottish and Welsh governments have set out their legal objections to Mrs May triggering Article 50 - the formal mechanism for leaving the EU - without seeking parliamentary approval. The UK Government has appealed to the Supreme Court after judges ruled that MPs must be given a say before she can fire the Brexit starting gun. But Scotland\\'s Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC will argue that the consent of Holyrood should also be required before Mrs May can notify fellow EU leaders of the formal start of the process. In a written submission to the Supreme Court he said triggering Article 50 \"cannot lawfully be made by an exercise of the prerogative alone\" would require an Act of Parliament and would also require the legislative consent of the Scottish Parliament. Counsel General for Wales Mick Antoniw echoed those views in a written statement stressing that he was \"not seeking to reverse the referendum result\" but a new law would need to be passed at Westminster and Mrs May could not \"short circuit\" the requirement for the devolved institutions to give their consent. The Supreme Court has also given permission for pro-Brexit group Lawyers for Britain to file written submissions on the case. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to back the proposals claiming the idea was a distraction from the broader issue of defining the country\\'s economic relationship with the continent. He told the Press Association: \"I want us to deal with the issue holistically - that is the question in relation with Europe. \"I want us to have market access to Europe I want us to retain environmental consumer and workers\\' rights when we come out of the European Union. \"That would mean that we would all have a good relationship with Europe and I think the idea of some sort of individual citizenship of Europe is a bit of a diversion from the big issue - which is the economic relationship we will have with Europe in the future.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A British exit from the European Union would be a serious risk to global economic growth Group of Seven leaders said in a summit declaration yesterday as Prime Minister David Cameron urged voters to “listen to our friends”. Brexit was not formally on the agenda at the two-day summit in Japan and despite both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande saying the issue had not been discussed Cameron said “one or two people” had raised it. “A UK exit from the EU would reverse the trend towards greater global trade and investment and the jobs they create and is a further serious risk to growth” G7 leaders said in the only reference to the vote in a 32-page declaration. Brexit was listed alongside geopolitical conflicts terrorism and refugee flows as a potential shock of a “non-economic origin”. The G7 statement follows comments from the International Monetary Fund that there were no economic positives to Britain leaving the EU while the Bank of England has said the economy would slow sharply and possibly even enter a brief recession. The OECD has also warned that British voters risk paying a “Brexit tax” equivalent to a month’s salary by 2020 if they leave the EU. Last week G7 finance leaders united in wishing Britain stayed in the EU at a June 23 referendum but acknowledged they could do little more than hope. “We should listen to our friends we should listen to people who want us to do well who wish us well in the world. When you are faced by a difficult decision it is often a good thing to listen to what your friends think” Cameron told reporters at a news conference after the summit. Merkel said although leaders had not discussed the issue there was a consensus that they wanted the country to stay in while Hollande said Brexit would be bad news. “It is not for us to say what the British people should be doing” he told reporters. “Economically it would be bad news bad news for the United Kingdom as well as the world not just Europe. That would trigger capital transfers as well as the relocation of some activities that would not be for the benefit if the United Kingdom or even for Europe.” Opinion polls have given conflicting steers on which way the vote might go with telephone polls suggesting “Stay” is comfortably ahead while online polls suggest a tight race that “Leave” could win. Betting odds heavily favour a “Stay” vote. Cameron said Britain could “find our way whatever the British people choose” but warned leaving the bloc would hurt the country’s economic future and complicate trade deals with countries such as Japan. He also rejected a description by a former aide this week that he secretly supported a vote for Brexit. “I have never been a closet Brexiteer” he said. “I am absolutely passionate about getting the right result getting this reform in Europe and remaining part of it. “It’s in Britain’s interests and that’s what it is all about.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Britain could pay in to some EU programmes after Brexit but the government will take back control of its own money and will no longer spend large amounts in Brussels Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday. Businesses investors and opposition lawmakers are clamouring for clarity on the government\\'s negotiating position before it triggers the formal exit procedure from the European Union by the end of March. Last week Brexit minister David Davis said Britain could pay into the EU budget to get access to the bloc\\'s single market of 500 million customers easing fears that the government is heading for a \"hard Brexit\" involving a clean break with the bloc. But Johnson speaking on the BBC\\'s Andrew Marr television programme declined to confirm whether that was a priority for the government saying ministers were considering several options. \"I\\'ve always thought that there were aspects of EU cooperation ... where actually ... to be part of that in the future might be a good idea certainly would be a good idea if it involved paying in\" Johnson said referring to the Erasmus student exchange programme and Horizon programme for research. \"(Paying in for single market access) is obviously something that David Davis is considering. That doesn\\'t mean that a decision has been taken.\" \"The crucial thing to understand is very large sums of money will be coming back to this country which ... could be spent on priorities like the NHS (national health service)\" said Johnson who campaigned for Britain to leave the EU on a \"battle bus\" that had written on its side: \"We send the EU £350 million a week let\\'s fund out NHS instead.\" Johnson has been criticised for saying the health service could benefit to such a large extent and since then has found some of his comments made during the campaign have come back to haunt him. Several EU officials have questioned whether they can trust him and some opposition lawmakers have accused him of putting one of the most complicated negotiations since World War Two in jeopardy by making unscripted comments. Brexit spokesman for the opposition Labour Party Keir Starmer called on the government to offer parliament more clarity on its plans. \"The government must put its basic plan before parliament so we can discuss it at the moment ... we are all going through trying to find fragments of evidence as to what approach they are going to take\" Starmer said. \"There are two very different versions of our future. One is an isolated hard Brexit the other is a collaborative cooperative Brexit. That\\'s the one the Labour Party has to fight for.\" But Johnson said the government was being clear in its aims and said from his experience officials he had met appreciated his honesty. \"Seriously what I find is that people do appreciate frankness and they do appreciate people saying what they think as much as possible\" he said. \"What I have genuinely found in the last few months is that the mood amongst our European friends ... has really changed and they are starting to see the positive possibilities.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

More than four out of five (82 per cent) also believe the number of UK-based financial services firms generally seeking to establish subsidiaries in the European Union will increase over the next three years due to Brexit.

A secret letter from British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Environment Secretary Michael Gove giving UK Prime Minister Theresa May apparent instructions on how to run Brexit has emerged. Transition arrangements for Britain\\'s exit from the European Union must end on June 30 2021 the Cabinet ministers demanded according to UK media They also urged the UK Prime Minister to ensure members of her top team fall behind their Brexit plans by \"clarifying their minds\" and called for them to \"internalise the logic\" the newspaper said. The leaked letter appears to make a thinly veiled attack Chancellor Philip Hammond who backed remain and wants a softer Brexit for lacking the \"sufficient energy\" in preparing for the UK\\'s future outside the bloc. A senior Government source told the newspaper the Foreign Secretary and Environment Secretary had conducted a \"soft coup\" and described Mrs May as \"their Downing Street hostage\". It comes as The Sunday Times reported that 40 Tory MPs had agreed to sign a letter of no confidence in Mrs May - eight short of the number needed. The leaked letter to the PM from Mr Johnson and Mr Gove titled EU Exit - Next Steps is marked \"For your and Gavin\\'s eyes only\" a reference to the PM\\'s chief of staff Gavin Barwell. It states: \"Your approach is governed by sensible pragmatism. That does not in any way dilute our ambition to be a fully independent self-governing country by the time of the next election. If we are to counter those who wish to frustrate that end there are ways of underlining your resolve. \"We are profoundly worried that in some parts of Government the current preparations are not proceeding with anything like sufficient energy. \"We have heard it argued by some that we cannot start preparations on the basis of \\'No Deal\\' because that would undermine our obligation of \\'sincere co-operation\\' with the EU. If taken seriously that would leave us over a barrel in 2021. \"We all want you to push your agenda forward with confidence and have your Government articulate the following...\" No 10 said it did not comment on leaks and neither Mr Johnson or Mr Gove commented. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn meanwhile called for Mrs May to \"govern or go\" and demanded Mr Johnson to be sacked for \"undermining our country\" and \"putting our citizens at risk\". In an article for The Sunday Times he wrote: \"Continuing uncertainty about the Government\\'s approach to Brexit is now the biggest risk facing our country. \"The Prime Minister must end the confusion take on the \\'no-deal\\' extremists in her Government and back a jobs first Brexit for Britain.\" In a statement to the Observer he wrote: \"We\\'ve put up with Johnson embarrassing and undermining our country with his incompetence and colonial throwback views and putting our citizens at risk for long enough.

Photo: Reuters  Britain does not intend to lower taxes far below the European average in order to remain competitive after Brexit but rather expects to keep a recognisably European economic and social model finance minister Philip Hammond said. Hammond himself had suggested in January that Britain may have to change its economic model to remain competitive in the event that it left the European Union without having secured an agreement on market access. The amount of tax that we raise measured as a percentage of GDP is within the European average and I think we will remain at that level Hammond who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU ahead of last year\\'s referendum is seen as a proponent of a relatively \"soft Brexit\" sometimes putting him at odds with cabinet colleagues who yearn for a cleaner break with the bloc. Senior ministers have given conflicting signals over key issues such as whether free movement of people could continue after Brexit with divisions coming out into the open since the ruling Conservatives lost their parliamentary majority in June. In an interview with French newspaper Le Monde published over the weekend Hammond was asked whether Britain would play the low-tax card to remain economically attractive after Brexit. \"It is often said that London would consider launching into unfair competition in terms of fiscal regulation. That is not our project or our vision for the future\" Hammond was quoted as saying in response. \"The amount of tax that we raise measured as a percentage of GDP is within the European average and I think we will remain at that level. Even after we have left the EU the United Kingdom will keep a social economic and cultural model that will be recognisably European.\" The comments were markedly different from Hammond\\'s responses in his January interview with German newspaper Welt am Sonntag which were seen as a thinly veiled threat to use corporate tax as a form of leverage in Brexit negotiations. Asked directly whether Britain would lower corporate tax Hammond had said that while he hoped Britain would remain a European-style economy with corresponding tax and regulation systems it may have to change its model if it left the EU without agreement on market access. \"In this case we could be forced to change our economic model and we will have to change our model to regain competitiveness\" Hammond said. \"We will change our model and we will come back and we will be competitively engaged.\" It would be \"very dangerous for Europe\" to fragment the financial services market based in the City In his Le Monde interview Hammond was also asked to comment on the prospect of banks potentially moving part of their activities after Brexit from the City of London to EU cities such as Frankfurt Paris or Dublin. Hammond responded that it would be \"very dangerous for Europe\" to fragment the financial services market based in the City which he described as an important component of the British and European economies. \"The big winner would not be Paris or Frankfurt but New York. Let\\'s not have any illusions: the major American banks are not going to fragment their activities between different countries\" said Hammond. \"They will either keep working as they do today or they will move their activities back to Wall Street which is particularly attractive given that the U.S. administration is in favour of deregulation and cutting taxes.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Jonathan Borg  About 30000 Maltese residing in the UK would lose nothing despite Brexit the UK’s Minister of State at the Department for Exiting the European Union has pledged. All those Maltese residing in the UK would retain all their present rights Lord Callanan told Times of Malta. And in return Malta would grant the same rights to all the British nationals living on the island. He admitted however that the UK would have a new migration policy after its exit that would change the rules for all those EU citizens including Maltese wanting to make the UK their home. Speaking to Times of Malta during a day-long visit to the island that included meetings with government officials on the future relations between the two countries and Brexit Lord Callanan an MEP for 15 years insisted there was no going back on the UK’s decision to leave the EU. A second referendum on Brexit was out of the question he said. The British government he said was determined to bring to a successful end the negotiations on a divorce from the EU. “People have decided in the referendum and have confirmed their decision in the last general election. Brexit is Brexit and there is no way we will change this decision” Lord Callanan insisted. Asked whether there should be a second referendum once the UK and the EU agreed on an exit package the Eurosceptic politician replied flatly: “No.” “This is no merry-go-round and we will not have a second referendum. This is ridiculous” he said. Many British MPs and pressure groups are insisting that the final negotiated package should be put to the electorate. The UK will have a new migration policy for EU citizens Maltese included who want to move there “We had a full debate and we made our decision. It will now have to be implemented in full” he said. Admitting he was one of the campaigners for the “leave” camp despite his then leader former prime minister David Cameron being on the other side of the fence Lord Callanan said the UK would be stronger not forming part of the European bloc. Asked how the UK would gain more weight on the international stage when it would be alone and not part of something bigger Lord Callanan said the nation would have many new advantages. “We will gain the economic benefit of being able to trade freely across the world with many countries we currently don’t have any agreement with” he remarked. “We will be able to make decisions on rules and regulations on our own instead of others\\xa0 making them for us and we will regain control of our money because are now net contributors to the EU budget” he added. Lord Callanan disagreed with Times of Malta when it noted that since the EU would remain the UK’s biggest trading partner the UK would lose its influence at the negotiating table while still having to adhere to EU rules. “While we are still trying to strike a deal on this aspect and we hope that things will not change too much we have the same situation when we export our goods to China or the US. We still have to adhere to their rules” he said. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s foreign minister Boris Johnson said that US President Trump would take a tougher stance were he leading the talks according to BuzzFeed. He also swarned there could be a Brexit meltdown but it will be \"all right in the end\". Johnson\\'s comments were secretly recorded at a dinner on Wednesday evening and released on Thursday by the news website just hours after ministers found a compromise on a backstop Brexit plan for the Irish border. Johnson said Prime Minister Theresa May was beginning to take a harder line but that there would be a need for level-headedness as talks became more difficult in the months ahead. \"I think Theresa is going to go into a phase where we are much more combative with Brussels” Johnson was recorded saying. \"You’ve got to face the fact there may now be a meltdown OK? I don’t want anybody to panic during the meltdown. No panic. Pro bono publico no bloody panic. It’s going to be all right in the end.\"There’d be all sorts of breakdowns all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he’d gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere. Johnson said Trump who is locked in a battle over metal tariffs with European allies including Britain would take a stronger approach if he were in charge of the negotiations. \"Imagine Trump doing Brexit” said Johnson. \"He’d go in bloody hard ... There’d be all sorts of breakdowns all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he’d gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere. It’s a very very good thought.\" May reacted defiantly to Johnson\\'s comments stressing that he was not the only one with strong views on Brexit. \"These are complex negotiations. Boris has strong views on Brexit but so do I\" she told Channel 4 news during an interview at the G7 summit in Canada. Earlier a spokeswoman for May had said the Prime Minister has confidence in Johnson. \"The PM believes that her cabinet and her government are working hard to deliver on the will of the people and working hard to take back control of our money laws and our borders\" she said. Johnson also appeared to criticise finance minister Philip Hammond who is regarded as one of the most pro-European members of May\\'s cabinet and has drawn criticism from eurosceptics. The Treasury is \"basically the heart of Remain\" and is trying to stop Britain from having full freedom on trade policy after Brexit by keeping it tied to the EU\\'s customs union and to a large extent the single market Johnson said according to BuzzFeed. On Friday Hammond said that a collaborative approach was better than a confrontational one in negotiations with the EU. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 10th 21:39  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

German drugmakers have been asked by the government to examine their supply chains for any vulnerability that could cause shortages of essential drugs in the event that Britain leaves the European Union without a Brexit deal. More than 2600 drugs have some stage of manufacture in Britain and 45 million patient packs are supplied from the UK to other European countries each month while another 37 million flow in the opposite direction industry figures show. Germany\\'s Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) has ordered the country\\'s main drug industry associations to gather information on the effect of a no-deal Brexit a spokeswoman for the health ministry said. \"The Ministry of Health currently has no evidence that the exit of the United Kingdom will lead to any disruptions in the supply of medicines in Germany\" the spokeswoman said. It is not yet clear when results will be available she said. The UK government has already asked British drugmakers to build an additional six weeks of medicine stockpiles to prepare for any no-deal Brexit - a target the industry has said will be challenging.\\xa0The highly regulated drugs sector is one of the most vulnerable because of uncertainty as to how medicines oversight will function in the event of an abrupt exit next March Germany is using BfArM\\'s quarterly \"Jour Fixe\" meetings with various stakeholder groups on drug shortages to prepare for Brexit. BfArM in 2016 instated the meetings with groups representing drugmakers physicians pharmacists drugs distributors as well as other government bodies to monitor and mitigate against drug shortages. The meetings have dealt with shortages of treatments such as Mylan\\'s <MYL.O> Epipen against allergic shock branded as Fastjekt in Germany as well as disrupted supply of blood pressure drug valsartan after batches produced in China had to be recalled due to toxic impurities. Industry groups which include German drugmakers including Bayer Merck KGaA and Boehringer Ingelheim as well as foreign suppliers such as Teva and Roche have been asked to consider the \"worst-case-scenario of a hard Brexit without transition period\" according to meeting protocols. The highly regulated drugs sector is one of the most vulnerable to Britain\\'s decision to leave the EU because of uncertainty as to how medicines oversight will function in the event of an abrupt exit next March. That has sparked fears of drug shortages and some companies including AstraZeneca Sanofi and Novartis have said they plan to increase stockpiles in Britain in case of a no-deal Brexit. Britain is set to leave that EU regulatory system and the Europe-wide drugs watchdog is moving from London to Amsterdam prompting many drugmakers to prepare duplicate product testing and licensing arrangements. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The European Union will reach a deal with Britain on Brexit in November if it does not do so this month European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker told Austrian newspapers. Juncker whose optimism was echoed in comments on Saturday by European Council President Donald Tusk said that the potential for a rapprochement had grown in the last few days confirming what diplomatic sources have told Reuters. EU Brexit negotiators believe a deal with Britain on leaving the bloc is \"very close\" the sources told Reuters in a sign a compromise on the most contentious issue - the future Irish border - might be in the making although details were scarce. \"We are not there yet. But our will to reach an understanding with the British government is unbroken\" Juncker was quoted as saying by Der Standard and Kurier and Der Falter. On Friday EU Brexit negotiators told ambassadors of the 27 states remaining in the bloc that there was no breakthrough on the Irish issue and much would depend on what their British counterparts bring to Brussels next week. \"We have to get away from this no-deal scenario. It wouldn’t be good for Britain or for the rest of the (European) Union\" Juncker was quoted as saying. Britain and the EU are trying to push for the divorce deal as well as an agreement on post-Brexit relations in time for two leaders\\' summits scheduled for Oct. 17-18 and Nov. 17-18. \"My assumption is that we will reach an accord which will achieve the conditions of the withdrawal treaty\" Juncker said adding that it was not possible to predict whether there will be a conclusion to the Brexit negotiations in October. \"If not then we will do it in November.\" Tusk also said it was possible to agree a deal with Britain on leaving the European Union by the end of 2018. \"I have hope close to certainty that we will manage to reach an agreement both on exit and on best possible future relations ... I hope that it will be possible to avoid major losses on both sides\" he said on the sidelines of a conference in Krakow Poland. \"We will try for it in October ... and I think there is a chance to have an accord by the end of the year\" he added. Juncker told the Austrian papers that a political declaration on future relations between Britain and its former European partners was needed to accompany the Brexit deal. \"You can\\'t absolutely keep separate the withdrawal treaty and the declaration of the future relationship between the United Kingdom and Europe\" he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

May tasked with delivering Britain\\'s exit from the European Union after a 2016 referendum which continues to divide the country must find a way through deadlocked talks in Brussels and then convince a sceptical parliament to back the outcome. On Sunday she launched an unusual plea for the backing of centre-ground voters who had previously backed the Labour Party but felt alienated by a shift to the left under current Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. \"I want voters who may previously have thought of themselves as Labour supporters to look at my government afresh. They will find a decent moderate and patriotic programme that is worthy of their support\" May wrote in an article for the Observer newspaper. Hot off the heels of a speech at her annual conference which polls showed was well received May sought to reinforce her message that the end of over eight years of austerity was in sight and that she was capable of delivering reform beyond Brexit. Labour called her message on austerity a con and said she was making \"desperate pleas in an attempt to revive her failing administration\". It looks increasingly likely May will have to rely on the support of so-called \\'moderate\\' Labour lawmakers to win parliamentary approval for whatever Brexit deal she is able to strike with the EU. On Sunday Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon said her 35 lawmakers would likely vote against the deal and could instead support a second public vote on the terms of Britain\\'s EU exit. Labour\\'s left-wing leadership have promised to vote against May\\'s deal unless it meets their tests - which it currently is unlikely to do. The 10 votes of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party which May relies on to prop up her minority government are also in doubt depending on what kind of compromise May has to strike in Brussels to resolve issues over the Irish border. Critics within May\\'s own party among them former foreign minister Boris Johnson want her to ditch the current Brexit plan. However the Sunday Telegraph reported that a sizeable eurosceptic faction could be willing to drop some of their objections to secure a deal. If May fails to win a vote in parliament Britain faces an unmanaged exit from the bloc which businesses and economists fear could badly damage the economy. The outgoing chief executive of insurance market Lloyd\\'s of London Inga Beale said her firm is accelerating Brexit contingency plans to transfer contracts to a Brussels subsidiary as she feel Britain is getting closer to leaving the EU without a deal. But Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said the possible negative consequences for Britain Ireland and other EU countries meant he thought the chances of securing a deal with the EU were \"good\". \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

There is still a one-in-four chance Britain and the European Union part ways in less than six months without reaching a deal according to a Reuters poll taken as EU leaders prepare to meet in Brussels later this week. The stubborn problem of resolving the United Kingdom\\'s post-Brexit land border with Ireland thwarted an effort over the weekend to clinch a deal before this week\\'s EU summit as negotiators admitted defeat after marathon talks. Both sides want to finalise talks by mid-November to give parliaments in London and Brussels time to approve a deal before Britain otherwise crashes out in March an outcome that would plunge businesses and millions of citizens into a chaotic and costly legal limbo. British Prime Minister Theresa May faces stiff opposition at home and abroad to her plans and is struggling with deep divisions in her own party. Boris Johnson her former foreign minister and figurehead of Britain\\'s Brexit campaign said talks were \"now entering the moment of crisis\". May said on Monday she continues to believe a deal is achievable and real progress had been made in recent weeks on both the withdrawal agreement and future relationship. She also said progress had been made on Northern Ireland the UK\\'s only land border with the EU. When asked what probability they attached to the likelihood of a disorderly Brexit - where no divorce deal is reached - economists questioned largely before the talks hit an impasse gave a median 25 per cent unchanged from a September poll. The highest forecast was 80 per cent. \"A deal is still more likely than not\" said Kallum Pickering at Berenberg. \"At any rate the range of possible outcomes remains wide. But then again did anyone seriously think this would be a walk in the park?\" The most likely eventual outcome is the two sides reaching a free trade agreement the poll taken October 9-15 found as has been predicted since Reuters first began polling on this two years ago. In second spot was leaving without an agreement and trading under basic World Trade Organisation rules. Holding in third place was Britain belonging to the European Economic Area paying to maintain full access to the EU\\'s single market. Keeping its position as least likely was Brexit being cancelled. No respondent pegged this as most likely. HOLDING PATTERN With little clarity as to how Britain will part ways with the EU the respondents did not expect the Bank of England to adjust monetary policy until after March\\'s departure. They forecast that it would lift the Bank Rate by 25 basis points to 1 per cent in the second quarter of next year and follow that up with a matching increase in early 2020. British inflation jumped after the Brexit vote mostly driven by a slump in sterling and is not expected back at the BoE\\'s 2 per cent target until late next year. It will average 2.5 per cent this year and 2.1 per cent next the poll said. Growth will remain robust albeit slower than expected for Britain\\'s peers. The UK economy is predicted to expand 1.3 per cent this year 1.5 per cent in 2019 and 1.6 per cent in 2020 the poll of over 80 economists found. When asked about the chance of a recession in the coming year economists collectively gave it a relatively low 20 per cent. That rose to 25 per cent when asked about the coming two years. \"Unless the Brexit negotiations collapse the likelihood of a full-blown recession remains low\" said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

May said she had written to EU President Donald Tusk \"informing him that the UK seeks an extension to the Article 50 period to June 30\".\\xa0 But according to a European Commission internal briefing note ahead of an EU summit this week delaying Brexit to June 30 would bring \"serious legal and political risks\". Elections to the European Parliament will be held on May 23-26 and the commission said that if Britain is granted a long delay it must organise ballots. \"Any extension offered to the United Kingdom should either last until 23 May 2019 or should be significantly longer and require European elections. \"This is the only way of protecting the functioning of the EU institutions and their ability to take decisions\" said the commission note which was prepared on Wednesday morning before May\\'s letter was received. It will be for the leaders to decide on the length of the extension -- and all 27 must give their approval -- but the commission said they faced a \"binary\" choice: May 23 or the end of 2019 at the earliest. \"Any other option (as for example an extension until 30 June 2019) would entail serious legal and political risks for the European Union and would import some of the current uncertainties in the United Kingdom into the EU27\" it warned. If a long extension is granted Britain must commit to \"constructive abstention\" in key EU debates such as the bloc\\'s budget and appointments to the next commission due to be constituted later this year. This is to stop Britain using its veto to block EU business as a tactic to secure more Brexit concessions from Brussels. In a similar vein the commission said it must be made clear that if an extension is granted it cannot be used to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement struck between the EU and Britain.\\xa0 Exasperated European leaders are demanding London tell them clearly what it wants warning that the risk still remains that Britain could crash out of the bloc ending its 46-year membership without formal arrangements. The British premier is struggling to keep control of the Brexit process after MPs last week decisively rejected the EU divorce deal for a second time. She has reluctantly accepted that Brexit must be postponed amid fears of an economic shock if Britain ends its membership of the EU with no new arrangements in place.\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Updated 11.35am British Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday urged lawmakers to back her agreement to leave the European Union but made little headway with a bid to coax rebellious members of her party into supporting her deal. May has repeatedly warned that if lawmakers reject her deal with Brussels which would see Britain exit the EU on March 29 with continued close ties the only alternatives are leaving without a deal or reversing Brexit. The British parliament is mid-way through a five-day debate on the Brexit deal ahead of a crunch vote on Dec. 11 which will define Britain\\'s departure from the EU and could determine May\\'s own future as leader. She currently looks set to lose that vote. The day before the vote on Dec. 10 the European Court of Justice of Justice will deliver a judgment on whether Britain can unilaterally reverse its move to leave. \"There are three options: one is to leave the European Union with a deal ... the other two are that we leave without a deal or that we have no Brexit at all\" May told BBC radio. May said she was speaking to lawmakers about giving parliament a bigger role in whether to trigger a so-called Northern Irish backstop arrangement or extend a transition period during which more EU membership terms would apply. Charm offensive? Concerns about the backstop are a key driver of opposition to the deal among both May\\'s own Conservative lawmakers and the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which props up her minority government. Supporters of a clean break with the EU say the backstop intended to ensure no hard border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and the EU-member Irish Republic could leave Britain forced to accept EU regulations indefinitely or Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of Britain. \"There are questions about how decisions are taken as to whether we go into the backstop because that isn’t an automatic\" she said. \"The question is: do we go into the backstop? Do we extend ... the implementation period?\" On Wednesday May\\'s top parliamentary enforcer or chief whip Julian Smith spent an hour meeting with pro-Brexit Conservative and DUP lawmakers listening to their concerns about the deal. But lawmakers who attended the meeting said he did not offer a solution to persuade them to back it. \"This was not about doing deals it was about listening\" said one leading pro-Brexit lawmaker. Another said it was: \"Too little too late.\" May\\'s minority government governs with a working majority of 13 thanks to its deal with the 10 DUP lawmakers. The DUP says it will vote against the deal but would support May in a vote of confidence if the deal fails. During the first two days of debate 15 of May\\'s own lawmakers have explicitly said they intend to vote against it. She will either need to win them back or win over a substantial number of opposition lawmakers which appears unlikely. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British trade minister Liam Fox said on Tuesday it was \"impossible\" for him to say if a Brexit deal could be reached with the European Union this month or next but Britain wanted an agreement and a deal is better than no deal. Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of a trade fair in Shanghai Fox said it was more important to get the right agreement than the quickest one. Asked whether a Brexit deal would be struck this month or next Fox said: \"That\\'s impossible for me to say\". \"But the prime minister says we are 95 per cent there. We want to close that gap. We want there to be an agreement. We have always said it is better to have a deal than no deal\" he said.\\xa0The prime minister says we are 95 per cent there. We want to close that gap. We want there to be an agreement The earlier Britain got an agreement the better for all as it would give better clarity in particular to British businesses but also to British citizens on what their future rights would be Fox said. \"So the quicker we get agreement the better but in the end it is more important to get the right agreement than the quickest agreement.\" With just five months until Britain is due to leave the EU talks are mired in a disagreement over an Irish \"backstop\" - an insurance policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland - between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member state Ireland - if a future trading relationship is not in place in time. \"We have got some issues to deal with on the Irish border still and we have made it very clear that we believe that no part of the United Kingdom should be treated differently from any other part. We simply have to work our way through that\" Fox said. \"We think there are answers to the practical issues involved.\" Ireland is willing to examine ways in which a \"backstop\" to keep the Irish border open after Brexit could be reviewed so long as it does not permit Britain to unilaterally walk away from it Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Monday.\\xa0A survey for Channel 4 published on Monday showed Britons would vote to stay in the European Union if there were another ballot Fox said he thought problems to getting a deal were surmountable including getting it through parliament. \"I think the hurdles are surmountable if we have the political interest and I think that if there is an agreement between the UK government and the other EU 27 governments it would be very hard for parliament to vote that down in favour of no deal. I think voters would find that difficult.\" A survey for Channel 4 published on Monday showed Britons would vote to stay in the European Union if there were another ballot as those in the biggest \"leave\"-voting areas change their minds. Brexiteers argue May\\'s predecessor David Cameron said during the referendum campaign that the decision would be final and there would be no re-runs. They say May should get on with delivering Brexit. Fox a prominent Brexiteer said there had already been a referendum. \"We don\\'t have a second general election because those who didn\\'t win didn\\'t like the results.

British MPs voted narrowly late on Wednesday in favour of legislation that would force the government to seek to delay Brexit beyond the current April 12 deadline. The vote passed by just one -- 313 votes in favour and 312 against -- in the lower House of Commons and the bill will now pass to the upper House of Lords for final approval on Thursday.\\xa0 The vote came as Prime Minister Theresa May and Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn agreed to hold further crisis talks on Thursday. With options running out May switched course and invited Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for talks on Wednesday in a bid to forge a compromise that avoids a chaotic \"no-deal\" departure from the European Union in eight days\\' time. Negotiating teams for both sides were to meet again on Thursday for a full day of urgent discussions. May\\'s divorce deal with the other 27 EU nations has been rejected three times by parliament and patience is wearing thin in Brussels as the deadline to end Britain\\'s 46-year membership nears with no agreement in sight. The premier said Tuesday she would seek another \"short\" Brexit extension at an EU leaders\\' summit in Brussels on April 10.\\xa0 - First talks \\'constructive\\' -May said Wednesday\\'s talks with Corbyn were \"constructive\" suggesting she might be prepared to bend her previous principles and listen to proposals for much closer post-Brexit trade relations with the bloc than many Conservatives are prepared to accept. Both sides showed \"flexibility and a commitment to bring the current Brexit uncertainty to a close\" said a spokesman for May\\'s Downing Street office. \"We have agreed a programme of work to ensure we deliver for the British people protecting jobs and security\" he added. Corbyn said: \"There hasn\\'t been as much change as I expected but we will have further discussions... to explore technical issues\" on Thursday. He told May that Labour wanted a customs union with the EU access to its single market and raised \"the option of a public vote to prevent crashing out or leaving on a bad deal\". If the talks between the government and Labour fail to reach a compromise that both can support May hopes the two sides can come up with mutually acceptable options that would be put up for binding parliamentary votes. - Merkel heads to Dublin -The British premier\\'s sudden change of tack was received with caution by EU leaders who wish to see the split resolved before the European Parliament elections begin on May 23. Finance minister Philip Hammond said it was an \"expectation\" that Brussels would offer a longer extension at the April 10 summit than the short one Britain is targeting but London would want to curtail it as quickly as possible after passing a Brexit deal. \"It would be in everybody\\'s interest that we moved into the implementation period at that point\" he told ITV television. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was to visit Dublin on Thursday to meet Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar for talks on Brexit. She has vowed to \"fight until the last hour\" to avoid a no-deal outcome -- something that would hit the UK\\'s only land neighbour Ireland hardest. \\xa0 Libya strongman\\'s forces prepare to advance on capital  Roads deadlier than guns in Libya \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The letter was signed by supermarkets Asda Co-op Costcutter Lidl Sainsbury and Waitrose as well as food retailer Marks & Spencer joined KFC McDonald\\'s and sandwich chain Pret A Manger.\\xa0 However it was not signed by Britain\\'s biggest retailer Tesco nor German discounter Aldi. \\'Significant disruption\\' \"On behalf of our businesses and the wider food industry we want to highlight to you the challenges for retailers and the consequences for millions of UK consumers of leaving the European Union without a deal at the end of March\" the letter said. \"While we have been working closely with our suppliers on contingency plans it is not possible to mitigate all the risks to our supply chains and we fear significant disruption in the short term as a result if there is no Brexit deal.\" Almost one third of the food consumed in the UK comes from the European Union they stressed. \"In March the situation is more acute as UK produce is out of season: 90 per cent of our lettuces 80 per cent of our tomatoes and 70 per cent of our soft fruit is sourced from the EU at that time of year. \"As this produce is fresh and perishable it needs to be moved quickly from farms to our stores. \"This complex \\'just in time\\' supply chain will be significantly disrupted in the event of no deal\" the letter added. After British MPs overwhelmingly rejected Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit deal earlier this month they will vote again Tuesday on what they want her to do next as the March 29 departure deadline looms. May has scheduled a day\\'s debate on Tuesday and MPs have introduced amendments which they hope could indicate which options may have majority support in parliament. Several amendments demand changes to the \"backstop\" arrangement in May\\'s deal which could see Britain in effect tied to EU trade rules in order to avoid a hard between Ireland and Northern Ireland. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain should stay in a customs union with the European Union even after it leaves the bloc Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Monday setting up a possible parliamentary defeat for Prime Minister Theresa May. As May tries to strike a divorce deal with the European Union by October she faces a rebellion by a small group of pro-Europeans inside her Conservative Party that Corbyn hopes to use to undermine her authority. May has ruled out any customs union with the EU after Brexit because it would prevent Britain from striking new trade deals with fast-growing economies including as China and India. The veteran left-winger disappointed some anti-Brexit politicians in his party by indicating he like May favours Britain leaving the EU\\'s single market Corbyn explicitly backed a customs union in a speech on Monday setting the stage for Labour MPs to join Conservative rebels in supporting the necessary amendments to trade legislation. \"Labour would seek to negotiate a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union to ensure there are no tariffs with Europe and to help avoid any need whatsoever for a hard border in Northern Ireland\" Corbyn said in the central English city of Coventry. But the veteran left-winger disappointed some anti-Brexit politicians in his party by indicating he like May favours Britain leaving the EU\\'s single market - the only way it would be able to prevent unlimited immigration from Europe. In a bid to win over rebels in May\\'s party Corbyn appealed to MPs of all parties and said Labour would not support any deal that would do lasting damage to jobs rights and living standards. \"I appeal to MPs of all parties to be prepared to put the people\\'s interests before the ideological fantasies\" he said. FREEDOM May stuck to her position. The vote on the amendments could be tight: May holds a working majority of 13 seats and while British media said between 10 and 15 of her party might rebel \"The government will not be joining a customs union. We want to have the freedom to sign our own trade deals and to reach out into the world\" the spokesman said adding that Britain would seek either a new \"customs partnership\" or a \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\" with the EU. The vote on the amendments could be tight: May holds a working majority of 13 seats and while British media said between 10 and 15 of her party might rebel a few pro-Brexit Labour MPs are expected to vote with the government. While defeat would represent a major challenge to May some of the Conservative rebels have already played down talk of a government collapse and any changes could be reversed later in the legislative process. Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the government would delay the vote partly because it wanted more time to convince its MPs to vote with the government. May is due to set out her own vision for Britain\\'s post-Brexit relationship with the EU in a speech on Friday following a special cabinet meeting on Thursday when she will also meet European Council President Donald Tusk who last week called her ideas on post-Brexit ties \"pure illusion\". While Britain\\'s politicians discuss what sort of Brexit they want EU leaders have warned that time is running out and they need more than vague statements from Britain in order to strike a proper deal by October. By staying within a customs union Britain would avoid tariff barriers for its exports to the bloc as well as the risk of a return to a \\'hard border\\' between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But that supporters of leaving the EU argue would prevent other trade deals around the world which they see as one of Britain\\'s big potential gains from Brexit. Labour is narrowly ahead in opinion polls but like the Conservatives remains deeply divided on its Brexit strategy and has no appetite for a second referendum on EU membership. The party\\'s divisions were exposed over the weekend when more than 80 senior members called on Corbyn to commit to remaining in the EU\\'s single market. \"During the transition period which was proposed by Labour in the first place Labour would seek to remain in a customs union with the EU and within the single market\" Corbyn said. \"That means we would abide by the existing rules of both during transition.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May called on her Conservative Party on Wednesday to pull together and unite behind her plan to leave the European Union saying \"if we hold our nerve\" she can win a deal \"that delivers for Britain\". On the final day of her party\\'s conference May rallied members trying to address their concerns that the Conservatives are becoming increasingly directionless under the weight of Brexit by calling on them to look to a brighter future. Dancing onto the stage in the city of Birmingham to ABBA\\'s \"Dancing Queen\" to a standing ovation May poked fun at herself after her dance moves were mocked on a trip to Africa and after last year\\'s conference when her speech was disrupted by a coughing fit a stage intruder and a disintegrating set. It was a warm welcome for a leader whose fragile position was put under further pressure after the EU rejected parts of her so-called Chequers plan and critics stepped up calls for her to rethink her strategy for Brexit Britain\\'s biggest trade and foreign policy shift for more than 40 years. But with just six months before Britain is due to leave the bloc she has so far weathered the Brexit storm shrugging off a barnstorming speech by her former foreign minister Boris Johnson which did little to hide his leadership ambitions. \"If we all go off in different directions in pursuit of our own vision of the perfect Brexit we risk ending up with no Brexit at all\" she said in a clear nod to eurosceptic lawmakers who have published their alternatives plan for leaving the EU. \"And there\\'s another reason why we need to come together. We are entering the toughest part of the negotiations ... What we are proposing is very challenging for the EU. But if we stick together and hold our nerve I know we can get a deal that delivers for Britain.\" She also tried to expand her domestic agenda attacking the main opposition Labour Party by saying their policies including the renationalisation of mail rail and utilities would mean increased taxes and drive away business. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn she said would \"outsource our conscience to the Kremlin\". Her words were aimed at easing the growing frustration of some Conservatives who openly say their party is directionless unable to set an agenda against the divisive rows over Brexit between competing wings of the party. DIVISIONS The pressure she is under from some in the party was underlined less than an hour before she was due to speak when Conservative lawmaker James Duddridge said he had submitted a letter to the party\\'s so-called 1922 committee calling on her to resign. Forty-eight lawmakers would need to write such letters to trigger a vote of confidence in the leader. \"Turns out there is a plan. That plan is Boris\" Duddridge wrote on Twitter after Boris Johnson\\'s speech on Tuesday. But in that speech Johnson seemed to pull his punches backing May for now while making a rallying cry for the party to return to its traditional values and to \"chuck Chequers\" in a sign of his leadership ambitions. Taking a swipe at Johnson May said she was taking decisions on Brexit in the \"national interest\" pressing her argument that her former foreign secretary\\'s alternative Brexit proposals would tear the United Kingdom apart. \"It is no surprise that we have had a range of different views expressed this week\" she said. \"But my job as prime minister is to do what I believe to be in the national interest. And that means two things. First honouring the result of the referendum ... and secondly to seek a good trading and security relationship with our neighbours after we have left.\" With no agreement with the bloc over the divorce or a future relationship the last day of the conference marks the beginning of what some officials predict will be a frenzied couple of weeks of diplomacy between London and Brussels as the two sides try to secure a deal to end more than 40 years of partnership. May and her team face weeks of difficult conversations with Brussels to win a deal but she also faces challenges from inside her own party and from her partners in parliament Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party. DUP leader Arlene Foster has used the conference to loudly set out her red lines for Brexit repeating that she will not accept a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. \"The red line is blood red\" she told the BBC. In her speech May again stuck to her Chequers plan named after her country residence where she hashed out an agreement over the proposals in July. \"So this is our proposal. Taking back control of our borders laws and money. Good for jobs good for the Union. It delivers the referendum it keeps faith with the British people\" she said. \"It is in the national interest.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Updated 9.30pm EU leaders were poised Thursday to offer Britain a short delay to Brexit but only if MPs back Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s divorce deal next week. And they warn that the alternative is a cliff-edge exit in eight days\\' time. Brexit talks at the European summit overran spilling into a working dinner that had been supposed to cover relations with China as the other 27 EU powers debated how much more time to offer May beyond next week\\'s scheduled March 29 departure date. A draft copy of their conclusions suggested they would allow Brexit to be pushed back to May 22 the day before European parliamentary elections but European sources told AFP that France was pushing for an earlier May 7 deadline and talks continued. The text also warned that any offer only applies \"provided the withdrawal agreement is approved by the House of Commons next week\". MPs have already rejected the text twice most recently last week plunging Britain into crisis. But both May and the EU insist the draft withdrawal deal is the only option warning that the alternative is that Britain ends its 46-year-old relationship with the bloc with no plan next Friday. \"In the case of a negative British vote then we\\'d be heading to a no deal\" French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters as he arrived at the Brussels talks. May also refused to rule out leaving the EU with no deal blaming parliament for blocking her plan but saying she was determined to deliver Brexit. She has requested a short delay to allow time for the ratification of her deal if it approved but said she would not accept a longer postponement. \"What matters is that we recognise that Brexit is the decision of the British people and we need to deliver on that\" she told reporters. \\'Until the last moment\\' May wrote to EU Council President Donald Tusk on Wednesday asking for a delay to June 30 to allow her to try one more time to get her deal through parliament. But the European Commission\\'s legal advisers warn that \"no extension is possible\" beyond May 22 as that would require Britain to take part in European Parliament elections. May has said it would be \"unacceptable\" to ask British voters to do this almost three years after they decided in the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union. Speaking before the meeting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the EU\\'s offer of a delay would \"put it fairly and squarely at the door of the British parliament to make that call\". However there are reports that some member states want the EU to offer a long delay if MPs reject May\\'s deal next week in a vote expected on Tuesday or Wednesday. EU diplomats previously suggested Britain would either have to leave before the European elections or take part in the vote and stay in the bloc until at least the end of the year. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Thursday that if there is another defeat \"then we will have to meet again next week\". German Chancellor Angela Merkel added: \"We should do everything we can until the last moment to make an orderly Brexit possible.\" However there is a chance the decision might be taken out of May\\'s hands. The prime minister had intended to hold a third vote on her deal this week but the Speaker of the House of Commons blocked it citing 400-year-old precedent that says the same proposition cannot be put to MPs again and again. May is hoping that the EU summit\\'s approval of fresh guarantees about the agreement will overcome the speaker\\'s objections. \\'National emergency\\' A \"no deal\" next week risks huge disruption on both sides of the Channel affecting everything from flights to trade and causing uncertainty to millions of expatriates. In a joint open letter to May on Thursday British business and union leaders warned: \"Our country is facing a national emergency.\" But May\\'s deal remains hugely unpopular among MPs on all sides of the Brexit debate with some arguing it keeps Britain too closely to the EU and others saying it would not keep it close enough. British voters are also sharply divided. More than a million people signed an online petition in 24 hours asking the British government to stop Brexit and thousands are expected at a march in London this week. Many pro-Europeans support a lengthy delay to Brexit believing it would increase pressure at home for a general election or for a second referendum that might reverse the decision to leave. But there is huge anger among those who want to leave the EU and do not understand why it is taking so long while eight of May\\'s senior ministers last week voted against any delay. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

European Union leaders formally agreed a Brexit deal at a Brussels summit on Sunday urging Britons to back Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s package which faces furious opposition in the British parliament. The 27 leaders took barely half an hour to rubber-stamp a 600-page treaty setting terms for Britain\\'s withdrawal from the European Union on March 29 and a 26-page declaration outlining a future free trading relationship. May joined them shortly afterwards for what will be a brief meeting to seal the accord. \"This is the deal\" European Union chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters on his way in to the meeting saying he believed May would get it through parliament and ruling out big new concessions. \"Now it is time for everybody to take responsibility -- everybody\" said Michel Barnier the Frenchman who has ground out the withdrawal treaty over the past 18 months. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Juncker called it \"a sad day\" saying Brexit was a \"tragedy\" and tough on both sides. \"I believe that the British government will succeed in securing the backing of the British parliament\" Juncker said declining to comment on what might happen if May fails. \"I would vote in favour of this deal because this is the best deal possible for Britain\" he added. In a sign of worries ahead Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite tweeted after the deal was endorsed in the summit chamber that the exit process was \"far from over\". Barnier called the package a basis for close future ties insisting: \"We will remain allies partners and friends.\" French President Emmanuel Macron said the Brexit vote showed Europe needed reform. He stressed that Paris would hold Britain to tight EU regulations notably on the environment in return for giving it easy trade access. The departure of a nation long sceptical of deeper EU integration was Macron said neither a moment for celebration nor mourning but Britons\\' free choice. \"THIS IS THE MAXIMUM\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte whose country is one of Britain\\'s closest trading partners praised May\\'s handling of the difficult negotiations and said he was confident that she could see the deal through parliament in the coming weeks. But he also had a warning for those in May\\'s Conservative party as well as the Labour opposition who argue that a better deal can still be done before Britain leaves in four months if lawmakers deny her minority government support on Brexit. \"This is the maximum we can all do\" Rutte said shaking his head when asked if the EU might make more concessions. Saying the EU \"hates\" Brexit Rutte said: \"Nobody\\'s winning -- we are all losing.\" But he said the deal was an acceptable compromise for all that gave May a chance to clinch a solution. The biggest question now facing the EU is whether May\\'s divided minority government can steer the deal which foresees London following many EU rules to keep easy trade access through fierce resistance in parliament in the coming weeks from both supporters and opponents of Brexit. Lithuanian President Grybauskaite said there were at least four possible outcomes if parliament blocks the package. She named three - that Britons would hold a second referendum hold a new election to replace May or return to Brussels to try and renegotiate the package. A fourth is that Britain will simply crash out of the bloc on March 29 without legal clarity. Both sides have been making preparations for such a \"no deal\" scenario though the EU insists Britain has more to lose. The pound has strengthened since the deal came together over the past 10 days but companies and investors remain nervous. The package foresees little changing during a transition period lasting another two to four years. BRITISH OPPOSITION The Democratic Unionist Party whose votes from Northern Ireland have helped May to govern since she lost her majority in a snap election last year said it would try to block a Brexit deal it called \"pitiful\" - partly because it binds London to many EU rules it will no longer help set and partly as the DUP fears it could weaken the province\\'s ties to Britain. In an open letter to the nation May said she would campaign \"heart and soul\" to get her Brexit deal through. \"It will be a deal that is in our national interest – one that works for our whole country and all of our people whether you voted Leave or Remain\" she said. Sunday newspapers said different factions in her own Conservative party were preparing alternative plans to keep Britain closer to the EU should her deal fail as many expect. Wrangling over how to keep open troubled Northern Ireland\\'s land border with the EU without creating barriers with the Irish Republic dogged much of the Brexit talks. Another relic of the imperial past Britain\\'s 300-year-old naval base on Spain\\'s southern coast threatened to derail plans at the last minute. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez threatened to boycott Sunday\\'s meeting if he did not get amendments to the deal to ensure Madrid gets a say in Gibraltar\\'s future ties with the EU. After officials wrangled through the night he announced on Saturday afternoon that he had such written pledges. Brussels officials said those essentially confirmed what most EU leaders had already understood - that Spain must have a binding say over how any future EU-UK trade pact might affect Gibraltar. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Finally after two tortuous years of negotiations it looked like the UK’s elected representatives were about to vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal. Then despite vowing to go ahead May decided to postpone the vote the day before. She had faced almost certain defeat and now says she will speak to EU leaders to find a new way forward. Technically and legally May was within her rights to back out of the vote. However the political optics are another thing altogether. This is a government remember found in contempt of parliament for withholding information from MPs. Pulling such an important vote out of self-interest does not look good. Doing so a day before the vote is not politic as Speaker John Bercow pointed out after her statement. Just how much of the normal running order of UK politics is the prime minister ready to jettison? It seems that May now intends to go back to Brussels and seek concessions around the Irish backstop – a sticking point that riled Brexiteers and Remainers MPs alike – in order to make the vote winnable at a later date. But the question here must be: what concessions? Is she going to ask that the UK as whole to stay in the customs union and maybe even the single market which is the only real way the Irish border (and the backstop) problem disappears? Not a chance: this would anger the Brexiteers in her party even more (if that is possible). Rather the concession she is after is to somehow make the backstop more palatable to the people she has been appealing to from the beginning: the hard Brexiteers. That might be something like agreeing that the backstop becomes a temporary arrangement somehow. How will opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn react to this delay? Is he going to try and stick to the line that he wants a general election promising that if – and it is a big “if” – he won that election he would go back and renegotiate with the EU? If so then his fate looks as bleak as May’s. What is it that he imagines he can offer that will provide enough fuel to power the EU27 to reopen the negotiations they have just taken so long to close? And remember they are not just reopening negotiations with the UK but among themselves too: they have to reach a unified position before they can agree a position with the UK. The idea that they will be able to reopen talks and get negotiations finished before the end of March is quite frankly ludicrous. Apart maybe from one scenario: that a Labour government would offer to stay in the customs union in the single market accept freedom of movement and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. That may be motivation enough for the EU – but it is essentially staying in the EU in anything else but name (and decision-making power). Whatever happens next one thing is clear: the heads of the UK’s two main parties are no closer to solving this problem from their positions of leadership. It is to other MPs then that voters should turn. Only the House of Commons acting as a collective body can steer the nation through this political mess. We should remember that despite all the cries of betrayal from the Brexiteers this House of Commons as a collective entity was constituted by the people in a vote that superseded the referendum: the snap election of 2017. The MPs that sit in this parliament are the representatives the people chose to enact Brexit in 2017. And key here is that this house of Commons is hung – there is no outright majority. A clearer display of where the country is at you could not find. As a reflection of that very vote this house has found it very difficult to agree on anything as the negotiations on Brexit have progressed. This then is the state of the House of Commons as we head into Christmas. And the reality is everything the government and the opposition have tried so far in terms of Brexit has so far failed. MPs need to find away to coalesce around a different way forward. There needs to be a a proposal plan or motion that will attract the magic number of 314 MPs needed for a majority in order that a way out can be enacted. Crucially we know that if such a plan were to emerge it would not be a hard Brexit or May’s deal – that much has been proven in the run up to the originally planned vote. Whatever the proposal would be we should remind ourselves and others that this will be the will of the people expressed via British constitutional means. Whatever the focus on the role of the PM and other individual politicians in another crazy week let’s try to remember that the collective sense of the country’s elective representatives is the key player here. Let’s hope it shows up. Andy Price Head of Politics Sheffield Hallam University This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Updated British Prime Minister Theresa May won the backing of her senior ministers for a draft European Union divorce deal on Wednesday freeing her to tackle the much more perilous struggle of getting parliament to approve the agreement. More than two years after the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU in a referendum May told reporters outside her Downing Street residence that she had won over her divided cabinet which includes some senior Brexiteers. \"The collective decision of cabinet was that the government should agree the draft withdrawal agreement and the outline political declaration\" May said outside her Downing Street residence after a five-hour cabinet meeting. \"I firmly believe that the draft withdrawal agreement is the best that could be negotiated\" May said as protesters shouted anti-Brexit slogans from the end of the street. It was not immediately clear whether any ministers had resigned over the deal which May hopes will satisfy both Brexit voters and EU supporters by ensuring close ties with the bloc after Britain leaves on March 29. But May the weakest British leader in a generation now faces the ordeal of trying to push her deal through a vote in the British parliament where opponents lined up to castigate the agreement even before reading it. It is not yet clear when parliament might vote on a deal. To get it approved May needs the votes of about 320 of parliament\\'s 650 lawmakers. The ultimate outcome for the United Kingdom remains uncertain: scenarios range from a calm divorce to rejection of May\\'s deal potentially sinking her premiership and leaving the bloc with no agreement or another referendum. May an initial opponent of Brexit who won the top job in the turmoil following the referendum has staked her future on a deal that she hopes will solve the Brexit riddle: leaving the EU while preserving the closest possible ties. But she has satisfied few. Brexit supporters in May\\'s Conservative Party which has been riven by a schism over Europe for three decades said she had surrendered to the EU and that they would vote down the deal. The Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which props up May\\'s government said it would not back any deal that treated the British province differently from the rest of the United Kingdom. Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn called it a \"botched deal\". Before May\\'s statement the BBC\\'s political editor said anger among Brexit-supporting Conservative lawmakers in her party was so high that it was likely they would call on Thursday for a vote of no confidence in her leadership of the party. May\\'s statement in full \"The Cabinet has just had a long detailed and impassioned debate on the draft Withdrawal Agreement and the Outline Political Declaration on our future relationship with the European Union. These documents were the result of thousands of hours of hard negotiation by UK officials and many many meetings which I and other ministers held with our EU counterparts. I firmly believe that the draft Withdrawal Agreement was the best that could be negotiated and it was for the Cabinet to decide whether to move on in the talks. The choices before us were difficult particularly in relation to the Northern Ireland backstop. But the collective decision of cabinet was that the Government should agree the draft Withdrawal Agreement and the Outline Political Declaration – this is a decisive step which enables us to move on and finalise the deal in the days ahead. These decisions were not taken lightly - but I believe it is a decision that is firmly in the national interest. When you strip away the detail the choice before us is clear. This deal which delivers on the vote of the referendum which brings back control of our money laws and borders; ends free movement; protects jobs security and our union; or leave with no deal; or no Brexit at all. I know that there will be difficult days ahead. This is a decision which will come under intense scrutiny and that is entirely as it should be and entirely understandable. But the choice was this deal which enables us to take back control and to build a brighter future for our country or going back to square one with more division more uncertainty and a failure to deliver on the referendum. It is my job as Prime Minister to explain the decisions that the government has taken and I stand ready to do that beginning tomorrow with a statement in parliament. If I may end by just saying this. I believe that what I owe to this country is to take decisions that are in the national interest and I firmly believe with my head and my heart that this is a decision which is in the best interests of our entire United Kingdom.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The traditional Christmas dinner in Britain is commonly roast turkey roast potatoes parsnips and carrots Brussels sprouts with chestnuts cranberry sauce and pigs in blankets (sausages wrapped in bacon). Here’s how a no-deal Brexit could bring some bah humbug to the table. Items that are grown in the UK won’t be affected but those that are imported will become more costly as they will be subject to tariffs and other expensive trade barriers. Let’s start with the good news. Parsnips and carrots are grown in abundance in the UK. They are available throughout most of the year and are rarely imported from abroad. So even a Brexit as hard as a raw parsnip is unlikely to affect this popular Christmas side dish. People with the Brussels sprouts-hating TAS2R38 gene are out of luck. Brussels sprouts are so abundant in the UK that they are actually exported around the world. The topical Christmas cracker joke “How will Christmas dinner be different after Brexit? No Brussels” is unlikely to be true for the actual vegetable. Although the UK is a major potato producer some potatoes and potato products still get imported to meet UK demand. This mainly applies to frozen or processed potato products such as frozen fries. Due to a large harvest in 2016-17 the UK is expected to be a net exporter of fresh potatoes in 2017-18. Fresh potato imports have been predominantly from EU countries but traditional suppliers such as France appear to have found other markets. UK fresh potato exports are predominantly to the EU (98%). So as long as growing conditions are favourable there ought to be sufficient fresh UK potatoes to roast for Christmases to come. It is thought that sweet chestnut trees were brought to Britain by the conquering Romans and like many other immigrants they have naturalised and become an important part of the food chain. In most years the nuts grow to a reasonable size in the south-east of England. But in other areas it is unusual for more than one of the fruits in each husk to reach full size. They are generally not harvested in time for Christmas but can be preserved by boiling and freezing. The fresh chestnuts you see at Christmas in the UK are mostly sourced from elsewhere in Europe. This is because sweet chestnut trees in the UK are threatened by both fungal blight and more recently the oriental chestnut gall wasp. If having reasonably priced quality fresh sweet chestnut imports is important to you at Christmas Brexit could be a problem. Cranberries provide a splash of colour at the Christmas table. They also make a good option for retaliatory tariffs against the US the world’s largest cranberry producer. The EU took more than 50% of US cranberry exports in 2018 with the UK leading the way. That is not to say the UK does not have its own cranberries. The two native cranberry species in the UK are Vaccinium oxycoccus (the Northern Cranberry) and Vaccinium microcarpus (the Small Cranberry). Wild harvesting used to take place in Scotland but due to habitat loss this is no longer done. As a consequence the cranberries bought in UK stores are the species Vaccinium macrocarpon. These are harvested in North America and eastern Europe using a method that involves flooding the land which is impractical in the UK. Vaccinium macrocarpon is also grown commercially on Terschelling an island belonging to the Netherlands. The Netherlands is also a global trade centre for fresh fruit and vegetable imports and exported about €6m worth of cranberries in 2017 (many of which were grown elsewhere). So the availability of cranberries in the UK is largely dependent on shipments from the EU. This supply chain arrangement may have to change after Brexit particularly if the UK were to decide not to follow EU trade legislation. Depending on the flavour of Brexit the costs of establishing a new supply chain independent of EU trade hubs and losing the economies of scale that the EU enjoys as a whole could lead to shortages initially and increased costs in the future. The majority of UK families opt for roast turkey on Christmas day. This will cost them more if there’s a hard Brexit. Turkeys are becoming more expensive to produce in the UK. Turkey producer Kelly Bronze’s prices for example are up by about 5.4% this year and have warned that a hard Brexit will affect their business by 70%. A significant cost of producing turkeys in the UK is related to the labour cost of hand plucking. This relies on EU migrant labour and staffing for the Christmas peak and is a real concern. Brexit scenarios considered by farmers’ groups indicate that any deal which affects the labour pool is likely to lead to increased prices. For those not paying a premium for hand-plucked turkeys any Brexit trade deals imposing tariffs or import restrictions on cheaper turkeys from the EU would not make them cheaper for the consumer. A trade deal with the US might provide the option of turkey meat marinated in chlorine – not necessarily to everyone’s taste. The average number of turkeys slaughtered in the UK per week in December 2017 was half a million birds or about 2m over the month. Allowing for the additional 1.6m from November the figure is still more than 6m short of the estimated 10m consumed at Christmas. The cost and availability of sausages wrapped in bacon is dependent on pork supplies. British farmers currently produce only 40% of the pork eaten in the UK. The other 60% comes from EU countries such as Denmark Germany and the Netherlands. So as with turkey a hard Brexit would lead to a rise in the cost of sausages and bacon due to either import costs or supply and demand issues. Christmas might only come once a year but Brexit is likely to make it even more expensive.

Malta is well prepared for the role it will be required to play as EU Council President when the Brexit talks start but one should not run away with the idea that Malta would be conducting the negotiations Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said this morning. He also reiterated Malta's view that Britain should get a fair deal which would be inferior to membership. One could not decouple access to the single market from freedom of movement. Parliamentary Secretary Ian Borg admitted that Brexit would add “complexity” to Malta’s presidency. “It is definitely too early to say what impact this will have on a technical level but it will definitely add a level of unforeseen complexity to Malta’s presidency” said Dr Borg who is responsible for Malta’s presidency of the council. He was contacted after UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced she would launch formal Brexit talks with EU leaders before the end of March 2017. Malta will take over the six-month rotating presidency in January. During this period the presidency chairs meetings at every level helping to ensure the continuity of the EU’s work within the Council. It is definitely too early to say what impact this will have Ms May yesterday ended weeks of speculation and said she would trigger article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty the formal mechanism for leaving the European Union heralding the start of a two-year negotiation period with the EU. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat yesterday tweeted that Malta was “geared to handle” the initiation of Brexit negotiations. He said the island’s presidency would ensure “honest brokers for a fair deal”. Dr Borg said Malta would not be directly involved in the negotiations over Brexit because that would be handled by the EU’s “technical heavy machinery”. Parliamentary Secretary\\xa0Ian Borg.

We’ll be an independent country. Crucially we still do want to have a good relationship with Europe and the European Union” she said. Ms May said Parliament would be kept informed stating: “This is not about keeping silent for two years but it’s about making sure we are able to negotiate that we don’t set out all the cards in our negotiation because as anybody will know who’s been involved in these things if you do that up front or if you give a running commentary you don’t get the right deal.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Toby Melville/Reuters  Britain avoided a collapse in mergers and acquisitions activity after the shock Brexit vote as foreign companies used sterling’s spectacular devaluation against the US dollar to snap up British companies Thomson Reuters data shows. British M&A totalled £145 billion in 2016 down sharply from the record £321 billion reached in 2015 – a year when the UK data was skewed by two of three biggest global deals – but was in line with the longer five-year trend. Total annual mergers and acquisitions values averaged £157 billion for the five years to the start of 2015. Britain also retained its place as the third largest M&A market after the US and China. Behind the headline numbers there was another clear trend: foreign buyers – such as Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox – shopping with dollars for bargains while domestic UK-to-UK dealmaking fell off sharply. “Brexit should never have been talked up as an Armageddon moment for UK M&A especially with such a sharp devaluation in the currency which has clearly been a stimulus for overseas buyers” Tim Gee London-based M&A partner at law firm Baker & McKenzie told Reuters. “Much of the activity in 2016 was skewed towards foreign buyers with less UK-to-UK activity” Gee said. “Total activity levels were not really knocked that much by Brexit but who was doing the buying did shift – deal values in 2016 are very similar to the historical trend.” Inbound M&A was $143.7 billion again down from 2015 but way above the $85.9 billion annual average for the five years to 2015 while domestic M&A was $33.7 billion down from an average of $53.4 billion over the same period. There were just 1355 domestic deals – the lowest figure in nearly two decades of data collected by Thomson Reuters. Last year was a record year for dealmaking involving UK-listed companies thanks to a series of jumbo deals including Anheuser-Busch Inbev’s $110.3 billion acquisition of SABMiller and Shell’s $53 billion merger with BG Group. The June 23 vote took many investors and chief executives by surprise triggering the deepest political and financial turmoil in Britain since World War Two and the biggest ever one-day fall in sterling against the dollar. On the day of the vote sterling traded above $1.50 but is now trading below $1.23 and fell below $1.15 at one point in October. While opponents of leaving the EU had warned that the UK’s economy would stall and investment stop if voters opted to exit the data since the Brexit vote has shown the economy was resilient. Just a week after Theresa May entered Downing Street to replace David Cameron as British prime minister Softbank founder Masayoshi Son made a $30.7 billion move for UK-based chip designer ARM Holdings. The second biggest deal of the year was struck by Murdoch: a $14.6 billion deal to buy European pay-TV firm Sky. People familiar with the matter told Reuters the American media corporation pounced after the Brexit vote sent the pound down against the US dollar and Sky’s share price tumbling. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A prominent Brexit supporter has joined senior Tories in urging Theresa May to scrap an appeal against a court ruling which states that Parliament must approve the triggering of the formal process to leave the EU. Former cabinet minister Owen Paterson joined Remain-backers Oliver Letwin former attorney general Dominic Grieve and ex-solicitor general Sir Edward Garnier in calling for the Prime Minister to abandon her Supreme Court appeal. It comes after the Scottish and Welsh Governments were given permission to intervene in the case in which the Government is appealing against a High Court ruling which states that Mrs May must get MPs\\' permission before triggering Article 50 of the EU treaties to begin the exit process. Mr Letwin a former minister who was director of the Government\\'s \"Brexit Unit\" following the referendum said avoiding the Supreme Court would avert a risk of judges granting \"veto powers\" to the Scottish and Welsh devolved administrations. Brexit-backer Mr Paterson said Mrs May should concede defeat because uncertainty is bad for the economy. Mrs May should concede defeat because uncertainty is bad for the economy He said Article 50 should be triggered on time - the PM has promised it by April - to make Brexit an issue in French German and Dutch elections next year in the hope that businesses in those countries will lobby for commitments to favourable trade terms with the UK. Mr Paterson told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \"I\\'m not a lawyer and I\\'m not an expert on this but ... I wouldn\\'t have a bet on the Government winning this one. \"I do agree with Edward (Garnier) - it is not good to have a confrontation with the courts. \"Although I do think you go right back to Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689 we have a very very clear case. \"My concern is we deliver on what the people wanted.\" Sir Edward and Mr Grieve said Mrs May should now bring forward a Bill in Parliament with the path to its approval looking easier after Labour committed not to block or delay Brexit. Sir Edward said: \"That way you avoid an unnecessary legal row you avoid a lot of unnecessary expense but you also avoid an opportunity for ill-motivated people to attack the judiciary to misconstrue the motives of both parties to the lawsuit and you provide certainty.\" Mr Grieve told Today that the Government\\'s chance of success at the Supreme Court hearing scheduled to start on December 5 is low. He added: \"I can\\'t see the point in the Government continuing with the case and also agree that if they enact primary legislation they will get it through Parliament.\" Three High Court judges ruled on November 3 that Mrs May does not have the power to trigger Article 50 alone. The Government quickly announced that it would appeal against the decision. A spokesman for the Department for the Exit of the European Union said: \"The country voted to leave the European Union in a referendum approved by an Act of Parliament and the Government is determined to respect that result. \"We will robustly defend our position in the forthcoming appeal. As the Prime Minister made clear (on Friday) our work is on track and we remain committed to triggering Article 50 by the end of March next year.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Sterling lost as much as 10 percent of its value in just a few minutes of trading early yesterday a \"flash crash\" that fuelled concerns about the vulnerability of the currency and other British assets to investor worries about Brexit. The pound recovered from the initial plunge which took it as low as $1.1491 in Asian hours and was driven dealers said by the automated algorithmic computer trades that now dominate the global foreign exchange market. But selling by European and U.S. investors quashed any bounce as first London then New York came on line driving a 2 percent loss on the day and putting sterling on course for its biggest weekly fall since 2009. The fall in sterling sounded like good news to investors in internationally focused UK firms which gain on overseas revenues and competitiveness when the currency falls. The FTSE 100 index was up 0.6 percent at its close led by mining companies and Asia-exposed banks Standard Chartered and HSBC while other European stock markets fell sharply. There are growing worries about the impact sterling\\'s losses and the Brexit nerves behind them will have on domestic demand inflation and economic growth in the years ahead But there are growing worries about the impact sterling\\'s losses and the Brexit nerves behind them will have on domestic demand inflation and economic growth in the years ahead. Ten-year gilt yields rose by as much as 11 basis points to 0.984 percent the highest since the week of the referendum vote to leave the European Union in June. <GB10YT=RR> The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized UK firms typically more dependent on the domestic market marked its third straight session of losses after hitting an all-time high on Tuesday. <.FTMC> “This is the first sign in a couple of months that there is some market concern about a Brexit\" said Jonathan Roy advisory investment manager at Charles Hanover Investments. \"What we\\'re seeing playing out is domestic-facing stocks weakening in the face of a potentially \\'hard\\' Brexit ... while we\\'re seeing strength in the FTSE 100.\" Hedging costs Sterling has been falling steadily for a fortnight as investors fret that the government\\'s intention to prioritise immigration controls over access to the single market in exit talks will spark deeper cuts to foreign investment in Britain. So far pension funds and other long-term fund investors have responded by buying UK shares and other assets while hedging the currency risk through options and other derivatives that allow them to sell the pound. That may change if the currency proves too volatile to allow them to fund those trades and measures of implied market volatility <GBPVOL=> surged yesterday to more than 10 percent for durations out to a year. Retailer Sports Direct <SPD.L> said the overnight move in sterling after it had entered into a hedging agreement to protect against weakness in the pound led to a 15 million pound dent in its full-year earnings forecasts. \"If the rate is $1.20 on average for the remainder of FY17 then the negative impact ... would be in the order of a further 20 million pounds\" it said.

Photo: Reuters  Leaving the European Union without a proper divorce deal could ground airlines stop hauliers from lugging goods to the world\\'s biggest trading bloc and even make headaches for pet owners who want to take their dogs on holiday according to government documents. With just six months to go until the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on March 29 Prime Minister Theresa May has warned that negotiations are at an impasse and that the EU must come up with new proposals on how to craft a divorce settlement. Many business chiefs and investors fear politics could scupper an agreement thrusting the world\\'s fifth largest economy into a \"no-deal\" Brexit that they say would spook financial markets and silt up the arteries of trade. Britain which has warned it could leave without a deal published 25 technical notices on Monday covering everything from commercial road haulage and buying timber to airline regulations and taking pets abroad. \"If the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 with no agreement in place UK and EU licensed airlines would lose the automatic right to operate air services between the UK and the EU without seeking advance permission\" the government said. Overall the government has published more than 65 such notices giving a glimpse of what a no-deal Brexit - the nightmare scenario for chief executives of most multinationals operating in Britain - would look like. Amid warnings that trucks could stack up on both sides of the English Channel in the confusion of a no deal Britain said it would seek to strike bilateral agreements with European countries to ensure hauliers would retain access. The notices covered a vast swathe of the British economy warning for example that labels on packaged food would have to be changed. \"Use of the term ‘EU’ in origin labelling would no longer be correct for food or ingredients from the UK\" the government said. Honey producers would have to change their labels while EU countries might not accept British mineral water the government said. In the worse case scenario for pet owners dogs cats and even ferrets might need health certificates and rabies jabs. Travel plans would have to be discussed with a vet at least four months in advance before traveling to the EU. That would mean someone wanting to take their pet to the EU on March 30 2019 the day after Britain leaves the bloc would have to dicuss the trip with a vet before the end of November. Without a deal the UK would move from seamless trade with the rest of the EU to customs arrangements set by the World Trade Organization for external states with no preferential deals. Brexiteers accept there is likely to be some short-term economic pain but say the government is trying to scare voters about the impact of a no-deal Brexit. Britain many Brexiteers say will thrive in the longer term if cut loose from what they see as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity and excessive debt-funded welfare spending. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The pound fell 1.5 percent versus the dollar and was headed for its biggest drop this year against the euro after Brexit minister Dominic Raab and three other ministers resigned in protest against her plan. Traders fear May\\'s leadership is now in serious jeopardy. \"What concerns us is how many ministers seeing this news will be pondering if it is better to get their resignations in now rather than wait\" said Nomura strategist Jordan Rochester. \"If several ministers go this becomes more difficult for Theresa May to hold her position\" he added.If several ministers go this becomes more difficult for Theresa May to hold her position May said on Wednesday she had won over her divided cabinet after a five-hour meeting but the resignations fuelled a selloff reflecting rising fear in the markets about a \"no-deal\" Brexit. In volatile trading the pound sank as low as 1.8 percent to $1.2751 its second biggest drop this year. It dropped 1.5 percent to 88.57 pence versus the euro. Markets had priced in some opposition to the draft deal negotiated by May but the latest round of resignations unleashed a fresh wave of volatility in UK assets. That sent investors to the relative safety of government debt. British financial regulators called major banks asking for feedback on market conditions because of sharp falls in the pound sources said. The prime minister showed little sign of backing down but senior Eurosceptic lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg said a number of letters of no confidence in May had been submitted to party officials. British Member of Parliament Jacob Rees-Mogg speaks from St Stephen\\'s Entrance at the Houses of Parliament in London. VOLATILE Concerns about a leadership challenge were reflected in the foreign exchange derivatives markets where three and six-month gauges of expected volatility in the British currency spiked to their highest levels in two years. Extreme short-dated volatility indicators also jumped. The brewing uncertainty about Britain\\'s economic future was also shown in the money markets where investors have all but priced out a rate hike by the Bank of England next year. Britain is now more likely to either stay in the European Union or leave it in a \"no deal\" Brexit than depart under the terms presented by Prime Minister May analysts from U.S. bank Citi said. \"Over the next few days the very real prospect of a hard Brexit will likely ensure that the pound remains vulnerable\" said Jane Foley an FX strategist at Rabobank. \"Any turn of events in Westminster that appears to increase the risk of a general election would likely compound the vulnerability of the pound\" she added. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday toppling her would risk delaying Brexit and she would not let talk of a leadership challenge distract her from a critical week of negotiations. Since unveiling a draft divorce deal with the European Union on Wednesday May\\'s premiership has been thrust into crisis by the resignation of several ministers including her Brexit minister and some lawmakers from her own party seeking to oust her. To trigger a confidence vote 48 of her Conservative Party lawmakers must submit a letter to the chairman of the so-called 1922 committee Graham Brady. More than 20 lawmakers have said publicly that they have submitted a letter but others are expected to have done so confidentially. Brady told BBC Radio on Sunday the 48 threshold had not yet been reached. \"These next seven days are going to be critical they are about the future of this country\" May told Sky News. \"I am not going to be distracted from the important job. \"A change of leadership at this point isn\\'t going to make the negotiations any easier ... what it will do is mean that there is a risk that actually we delay the negotiations and that is a risk that Brexit gets delayed or frustrated.\" May said negotiating teams were working \"as we speak\" and she intended to go to Brussels and meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. She said she would also be speaking to other EU leaders ahead of an EU summit to discuss the deal on Nov. 25. Several British newspapers reported that five senior pro-Brexit ministers were working together to pressure May to change the deal but writing in the Sun on Sunday newspaper May said she saw no alternative plan on the table. Former Brexit minister Dominic Raab who resigned on Thursday in protest at the deal said he supported May as leader but her deal was \"fatally flawed\" and he did not think it would be approved by parliament. He said May must change course. \"I still think a deal could be done but it is very late in the day now and we need to change course\" Raab told the BBC. \"The biggest risk of no deal is taking a bad deal to the House of Commons ... it is very important to take the action now.\" Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would vote against May\\'s deal when it came to parliament but distanced himself from calls for a so-called people\\'s vote on the final agreement. \"It\\'s an option for the future but it\\'s not an option for today because if we had a referendum tomorrow what\\'s it going to be on? What\\'s the question going to be?\" Corbyn told Sky News. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The pound has slightly weakened since the initial devaluation brought about after the 2016 referendum. In furtherance there has been no crash in asset prices such as the 1976 IMF crisis the 1992 European Exchange Rate Mechanism and the 2008 financial crash. Nonetheless there has been significant increases in concern relating to inflation risks surrounding the UK asset market. As the market absorbed the inflationary impact derived from the 20% pound devaluation the UK inflation rate risen by a full percentage point in June 2016. Moreover as soft Brexit seemed to be probable in 2017 the inflation rate fell marginally but has risen by about 0.6% since March. Although the rise in the UK inflation rate appears limited the major concern is that the surge in the inflation occurred within a period where by the inflation rate in other major economies has declined due to oil price crashes. In comparison to the US the UK inflation rate has risen by 0.8% since last summer. It is critical to identify why the inflation scenario in the UK have worsened. Of note the increase in the inflation rate has outperformed the increase in consensus economic forecasts for UK inflation over the same period. It is therefore critical to note that such change has been brought about by an increase in the inflation risk premium and not by a shift in the UK inflation expectations thus raising concern relating to the tail risk of a higher inflation rate. There are numerous reasons as to why such tail risk has recently risen. Keeping in mind that the UK labour market is extremely tight and the wage inflation is above the 2% inflation target the imposition of hard Brexit would result into a continued sterling devaluation. A hard Brexit may also result into continued problems relating to public borrowing and fiscal sustainability in the UK. Due to the recent episodes of high inflation rates in Britain UK inflation expectations are not as well anchored as they are in the US Eurozone and Japan. The latter thus contributes towards a further increase in tail risk. Although the above-mentioned scenario does not demonstrate a pleasant constitutional situation within the UK it is important to emphasise that this has not yet developed into an economic or financial crisis. However the increased level of concern relating to the possible implementation of a hard Brexit together with consequences derived from the tight labour market and the macroeconomic policy are all contributing towards a hike in inflation risk.

Lloyds made it clear some months ago it wanted to open an office in another EU member state as soon as British Prime Minister Theresa May set Article 50 in motion to negotiate Brexit – meant to be by the end of March. Lloyds chief executive Inga Beale had originally said the company was considering Dublin Paris and Frankfurt but by October she said Malta and Luxembourg had been added to the list. The sources said Lloyds had sent a delegation to Malta last month as a result of which the island was put in pole position. Lloyds intends to keep its 328-year-old base in London but will most likely move its top management to the new subsidiary which will have to be capitalised separately running into tens of millions of euros. The other – clearly more costly – option would be to have a branch in each of the member states a possibility believed to have been all but ruled out. The issue is passporting that is having the ability to conduct business from one jurisdiction in all the other member states. Passporting rights represent around four per cent of the company’s total premiums. “The impact on Malta of hosting such a prestigious brand cannot be underestimated. It would be a game-changer in terms of attracting other big names” the sources said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The $200 to $300 million total is the cost of the transition to France HSBC said up to $1 billion in revenue could be at risk from Britain’s exit from the EU but it should be able to preserve the income by shifting associated jobs to Paris Gulliver said. Companies are spending tens of millions of dollars getting ready for Britain’s exit with international banks establishing new subsidiaries in the bloc or developing existing ones. That’s despite there being little clarity on how much business their UK outposts will be able to in the EU once Britain leaves in March 2019. HSBC chairman Douglas Flint said a meeting he attended between Brexit minister David Davis and British company executives last month showed signs of an improved relationship between the government and business over Brexit. “The meeting was evidence of that it was a well-designed meeting with the right people in the room and each side interested in understanding each other” Flint told Reuters yesterday. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The European Parliament expects to be able to endorse any deal with London just two weeks before Britain leaves the EU on March 29 a leading lawmaker said on Monday highlighting how tight the schedule is to agree on divorce terms and future ties. Danuta Hubner head of the European parliament\\'s constitutional affairs committee that will first handle the agreement said the target to hold a vote would be a plenary session due March 11-14.\\xa0The chamber of 751 lawmakers will need more than two months to process the agreement It was one of the first times a senior lawmaker has discussed the likely timing of the vote making clear just how close to the deadline it will be. The European legislature must endorse any Brexit deal for it to take effect meaning a \"no\" vote could force Britain to crash out of the EU with no accord. \"We have to vote during the first March plenary\" Hubner told her committee. \"The second one (due March 25-28) will be too late because after us the Council (of all EU member states) must look into this again.\" She said EU leaders did not know if they \"will be successful in finalising negotiations in October or they will slip to November.\" \"Hopefully not beyond November\" she said adding any further delay would greatly increase the risk of the most damaging scenario of a no-deal Brexit. Parliament officials estimate the chamber of 751 lawmakers will need more than two months to process the agreement. Lawmakers are keen to subject it to proper scrutiny to make sure it does not look like a rubber stamp. The EU parliament also wants to vote only after Britain\\'s parliament to avoid endorsing a deal that may then get struck down in London. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Scottish\\xa0businesses said that Britain’s impending exit from the EU was already making it hard to fill gaps in their workforces citing a skills shortage visa problems and a negative uncertain image of the UK abroad. In evidence given to a UK parliamentary committee representatives of the food and drink tourism health and social care sectors pointed to difficulties recruiting and training staff to cope with demand for their services particularly in Scotland’s many rural communities. They also expressed worries about the bureaucracy of a future migration system which they said would hamper both small\\xa0businesses and applicants. The decline in the pound against the euro was another factor as it diminished the value of earnings workers could send back to their families abroad. “Our profound fear is that now we are already in the process of that [workforce] tap being turned off where is that workforce going to come from?” asked Donald Macaskill the chief executive of Scottish Care which represents a sector supporting around 100000 care-home care-at-home jobs. Where is that workforce going to come from? He said six to eight per cent of his nurses at care homes were from the European Economic Area. As Britain approaches the second phase of Brexit negotiations centring on trade many companies have asked for clarity on what status EU workers living in the UK will have during an expected transition phase of two years. Many Britons who voted for Brexit did so because they were unhappy about the flow of migrants into Britain and one of the key issues for them is stopping the unlimited flow of EU citizens into Britain as a full EU member. For\\xa0business however recruiting staff is becoming more difficult. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British lawmakers will debate the government's proposed legislation on post-Brexit customs arrangements and trade on July 16 and 17 creating another potential flashpoint between Prime Minister Theresa May and pro-European Union lawmakers. The debates will be a chance for lawmakers in May's Conservative Party to make the case for Britain to remain in a customs union with the EU - something May has ruled out despite being unable to find an alternative that is acceptable to her cabinet and Brussels. The customs bill is a technical piece of legislation creating the legal powers for the government to put in place an as yet undetermined customs policy on imposing duties on goods entering the country. The trade bill covers converting the EU's existing trade deals into bilateral deals direct with Britain. Customs policy has become one of the most difficult hurdles in talks with Brussels and a British negotiating position is still being thrashed out at government level. The customs legislation known as the Taxation (Cross Border Trade) Bill is provisionally scheduled for July 16 with the Trade Bill up for debate the next day. Last month May's minority government passed laws that will end Britain's EU membership in March next year. To do that she had to make several compromises to avoid a hugely damaging defeat in parliament at the hands of a group of pro-EU rebels - one of two factions within her party with opposing views on what Brexit should look like. At the time some of the pro-EU lawmakers indicated they had chosen not to rebel on that bill in order to make their case during the customs and trade legislation debates. Both bills will need to go through several additional stages before becoming law. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Brussels Athens and Piraeus are among cities London insurance brokers could consider for European Union subsidiaries with time running out to plan for a hard Brexit a trade body said on Wednesday. The Lloyd\\'s of London commercial insurance market is setting up an EU subsidiary in Brussels to start writing business from January 2019. A number of other large insurers such as AIG and Aviva are also setting up EU hubs in centres such as Luxembourg and Dublin in the event that Britain loses access to the European Union\\'s single market after Brexit. But brokers have generally been slower to set up such units industry sources say. \"At this advanced stage of the game it would be foolish to ignore the very real possibility of no deal for the UK\" Christopher Croft chief executive of the London Insurance and International Brokers Association (LIIBA) said in a statement accompanying the trade group\\'s mid-year report. \"That’s why we’re encouraging our members to address this scenario now.\" LIIBA has been in talks with the Belgian government and regulators to help brokers considering Brussels as an EU hub Croft said. \"LIIBA will be pursuing a more in-depth exploration of whether Athens or Piraeus could prove a viable alternative location\" he added. A number of LIIBA members already have operations in the port town of Piraeus near Athens as the trade body represents brokers accounting for one third of global marine insurance premiums Croft told Reuters by e-mail. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Ireland will see a new \"hard border\" spring up with the North if Britain fails to approve a Brexit withdrawal deal with the European Union Brussels warned on Tuesday EU commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said he had heard nothing new since British Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s laid out a tweaked divorce plan on Monday. \"If you\\'d like to push me and speculate on what might happen in a no-deal scenario in Ireland I think it is pretty obvious: you will have a hard border\" he said. A new physical frontier between the British province and the Irish Republic would increase the threat that Brexit poses to the peace deal that ended decades of unrest. Schinas also expressed frustration as journalists questioned him over the next steps in the negotiation. \"In all honesty I have a terrible sense of deja vu in all these exchanges\" he said. \"There is nothing else that I can meaningfully say.\" On Monday May appeared before a British parliament anxious to hear a \"Plan B\" after lawmakers rejected the withdrawal agreement she signed with Europe last year. Instead she promised to seek changes to the accord to push back the prospect of Europe invoking a \"back stop\" clause that would keep Britain in the EU customs union. \"I will not now speculate on this Plan B because as I said seconds ago we are for Plan A which is set by the withdrawal agreement\" Schinas said. The back stop insurance policy in the agreement that May welcomed in November is intended to prevent the return of a border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. European leaders have repeatedly warned they will not re-open the withdrawal agreement raising fears Britain will leave the bloc without a deal on March 29\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The UK government has suffered a damaging defeat in the Lords over its plan to start negotiations on leaving the EU at the end of this month. Ignoring stern warnings not to amend the Brexit Bill peers backed a Labour-led move to guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in the UK by a majority of 102. Voting was 358 to 256 after a passionate and sometime ill-tempered three-hour committee stage debate on the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill. The defeat means the Bill which was passed unamended by the Commons will now have to return there for further consideration by MPs. It could put at risk Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s timetable for triggering Article 50 to begin Brexit talks by the end of March.\\xa0 Shadow Brexit minister Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town warned against EU nationals being used as \"bargaining chips\" in negotiations to quit the EU. Lady Hayter said the concerns of EU nationals here and British expats living in Europe shouldn\\'t be \"traded against each other\". Urging ministers to remove the uncertainty she said: \"These people need to know now - not in two years\\' time or even 12 months\\' time. They simply can\\'t put their lives on hold.\" Home Secretary Amber Rudd wrote to every peer yesterday urging them not to back the Opposition amendment to the legislation and was present for part of the debate - sitting on the steps in front of the throne like the Prime Minister did at the Bill\\'s second reading. But it failed to persuade peers that the Bill should pass unamended and become law as quickly as possible.

The source confirmed an earlier tweet by the Press Association which said the government would look to reverse the change when the amended bill is put before the lower house of parliament. Both houses must approve any changes before the bill can become law and before May can trigger the legal exit process. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s opposition Labour leader will try to rally his party behind a campaign to keep Britain in the European Union after polls indicated growing momentum for those wanting to leave and the nation\\'s biggest-selling paper backed Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn criticised by some for offering only lukewarm backing for his party\\'s \"In\" stance will tell supporters today that remaining in the EU would protect jobs pitching to Labour voters who campaigners say will be key in deciding the outcome of the June 23 referendum. The vote will help determine Britain\\'s future in trade and world affairs but also shape the EU. The pound and euro have lost value on fears a British exit from Europe or Brexit would tip the 28-member bloc back into recession. With Prime Minister David Cameron\\'s Conservative Party deeply split over the issue the prime minister who wants to keep Britain in the EU has recently given the left-leaning opposition party the lead role in the \"Remain\" campaign. According to a YouGov poll for yesterday\\'s Times newspaper the \"Out\" campaign has opened up a 7-point lead over \"In\" while an ORB poll for The Daily Telegraph put \"Out\" one point ahead. In another though not unexpected boost for the \"Leave\" campaign media tycoon Rupert Murdoch\\'s Sun newspaper called on its readers to vote to quit the EU. \"The Sun urges everyone to vote Leave. We must set ourselves free from dictatorial Brussels\" said the tabloid which has a circulation of 1.7 million but may be preaching to the converted as many of its readers already back a Brexit according to polls.  Bookmakers which up until last week had the \"In\" camp as firm favourite have been slashing the odds on Brexit. \"We were forced to shorten our Brexit odds yet again overnight ... and the momentum is such that it seems inevitable Brexit will be favourite by the weekend if this trend continues\" said Graham Sharpe William Hill\\'s spokesman. The uncertainty around the result has led to huge swings in the value of sterling. On Tuesday it was down almost 1 percent against the dollar and half a percent against the euro compared to closing levels in New York but was holding just above two-month lows hit on Monday. RELYING ON LABOUR Polls suggest a majority of Conservative voters back Brexit which means Cameron is relying on Labour which is much more pro-EU to help win the vote to stay in the bloc. Labour\\'s leftist leader Corbyn who says the EU is not sufficiently just but that his party has decided it is best to campaign for justice within the bloc has been accused of not doing enough so far to galvanise its supporters. He denies the charge. A YouGov poll late last month showed nearly half of Labour supporters did not know the party backed staying in the EU. A YouGov poll late last month showed nearly half of Labour supporters did not know the party backed staying in the EU Corbyn will join with his senior team and trade union leaders on Tuesday to make what he will describe as \"Labour\\'s case\" to remain. \"Today I am issuing a call to the whole Labour movement to persuade people to back Remain to protect jobs and rights at work\" he will say according to advance extracts of his speech. \"We have just nine days to go to convince Labour supporters to vote Remain.\" Tuesday\\'s event part of what the \"In\" camp has dubbed the \"Labour fight-back\" follows a speech by former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown on Monday in which he said Britain should be \"leading not leaving\" the bloc. While those wanting to stay in the EU can count on the support of many of Britain\\'s biggest businesses most economists and foreign leaders such as U.S. President Barack Obama fears about uncontrolled immigration from Europe and the impact on jobs and services is proving key for the \"Out\" campaign. \"If we stay in the EU as Cameron wants we will finally give up any chance of controlling our population\" The Sun tabloid said in its front-page editorial. Associate Editor Trevor Kavanagh told BBC radio on Tuesday it was the paper\\'s editor who had made the decision to back Brexit rather than Murdoch a longstanding and vocal EU critic although in March Kavanagh had said it would be Murdoch who would decide. \"We can only say what we believe and I think that a lot of our readers do believe what we say not because we say it but because they\\'ve come to that conclusion themselves\" Kavanagh said. In an article for the London Evening Standard in February veteran journalist Anthony Hilton said he once asked Murdoch why he was so opposed to the European Union. \"\\'That\\'s easy\\' he replied. \\'When I go into Downing Street they do what I say; when I go to Brussels they take no notice\\'.\" At a 2012 public inquiry into the press Murdoch rejected suggestions he had influence over British politicians. In a world of declining sales and burgeoning new and social media the stance taken by the press is viewed as mattering less than it once did. \"I think the British public don\\'t always take the press stories with the seriousness that perhaps journalists think they do\" Oliver Daddow a Senior Lecturer in International Relations at Nottingham Trent University told Reuters. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Neil Hall/Reuters  Lower hiring by British companies in financial and business services construction and utilities could be “cracks in the ice” of the country’s labour market a survey of employers showed yesterday two-and-a-half months after the Brexit vote. Manpower Group’s quarterly survey of more than 2000 employers – its first since voters decided to leave the European Union in June – also showed that poorer areas such as Northern Ireland and Wales faced weakening employment prospects. Overall employers intended to hire more people than they will fire in the fourth quarter. An increase in hiring intentions in London and northwest England and in the agricultural hotel and retail businesses kept the hiring outlook index unchanged at +5 per cent. But business and finance services construction and utilities – described as bellwether sectors – all reported four-point falls in employer optimism from the third quarter. Britain’s unemployment rate has fallen sharply over the past three years but it is expected to rise in the coming months and years as the economy slows due to uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. Manpower said hiring intentions in manufacturing fell two points to the weakest level in three years despite a fall in the value of the pound that should make exports more competitive. Manpower Group said the survey showed “vital warning signs that the UK jobs market could be in for a rough ride”. “After the initial shock of Brexit we’re entering a new phase of prolonged economic uncertainty” the head of Manpower’s British unit Mark Cahill said in the statement. A British exit from the EU’s single market may impose new barriers for UK companies doing business with the continent. The survey also showed a weaker outlook for the labour market in the UK’s poorer regions. Hiring intentions in Wales and Northern Ireland fell six per cent from the third quarter while in Scotland the index fell two per cent. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British manufacturing output fell in July at the fastest pace in a year confirming earlier signs that factories took an immediate hit after the vote to leave the European Union official data showed yesterday. But overall industrial output unexpectedly rose thanks to strong oil and gas production the UK Office for National Statistics said. Output in manufacturing fell 0.9 per cent following a 0.2 per cent drop in June. Economists polled by Reuters had expected manufacturing output to fall 0.4 per cent in July. The data are the first official figures to cover economic output solely for the period after the June 23 Brexit vote. Britain was plunged into political chaos in the weeks after the referendum before the formation of a new government under Prime Minister Theresa May. There seems to have been no immediate benefit to UK manufacturers from the devaluation of the pound Data released earlier yesterday showed German industrial production posted its steepest fall in 23 months in July. Economists said the German figures probably reflected concerns about the consequences of Britain’s decision to leave the EU. A closely watched survey by financial data company Markit had already suggested British manufacturing output plunged in July before staging one of its sharpest rebounds on record in August. The ONS said yesterday British industrial output in July unexpectedly rose 0.1 per cent on the month after stagnating in June helped by oil and gas. Economists polled by Reuters had expected it to edge down 0.2 per cent. Oil and gas production figures were boosted by continued output at the Buzzard oil field in the North Sea which usually shuts down for maintenance in July. Maintenance this year will occur in September. The ONS said there was no sign of manufacturers getting an immediate boost from sterling’s plunge since the Brexit vote because contracts are usually slow to respond to currency fluctuations. “There seems to have been no immediate benefit to UK manufacturers from the devaluation of the pound” ONS statistician Kate Davies said in a statement. Despite signs that consumers have mostly shrugged off the Brexit vote the economy looks set to slow in the third quarter. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The global economic outlook has become more uncertain after Britain’s vote to leave the European Union the European Central Bank said yesterday reaffirming its readiness to act if needed to support eurozone inflation. After a spike in volatility in the wake of the June 23 referendum financial markets have returned to a relative calm but economists have warned the full economic effect of the Brexit vote may have yet to materialise. “Financial market volatility following the referendum in the UK on EU membership has been short-lived” the ECB said in its regular economic bulletin.“However uncertainty about the global outlook has increased while incoming data for the second quarter point to subdued global activity and trade.” Surveys suggest Britain’s economy is shrinking at its fastest rate since the 2008-09 financial crisis and the Bank of England cut interest rates yesterday for the first time since 2009. With the eurozone economy having largely shrugged off the Brexit vote so far the ECB yesterday reaffirmed its expectation of a “moderate” recovery. This view was shared by the head of Germany’s central bank Jens Weidmann one of the most hawkish ECB rate setters. “My impression is that the economic outlook for the currency area has not fundamentally changed through the Brexit vote” Weidmann told German weekly Die Zeit and Italian daily Corriere della Sera in interviews published yesterday. “There may well be a small damper but in general the upward trend will continue” he said adding it was too early to give any reliable forecasts for what this might mean for future price developments. Investors have been betting the ECB will soon extend its €80 billion a month money-printing programme beyond its current end-date in March 2017 and change the terms of the scheme to avoid hitting constraints on sovereign debt purchases. Echoing ECB president Mario Draghi’s July policy statement the ECB said it was awaiting more information including new staff projections to be published in September before making any decision on new policy moves. “If warranted to achieve its objective the governing council will act by using all the instruments available within its mandate” the eurozone’s central bank said. Weidmann opened the door to some changes but drew the line at touching a rule dictating that government bond buys must reflect each country’s contribution to the central bank’s capital which makes Germany the biggest beneficiary. “If we grant individual countries special conditions or concentrate increasingly on highly indebted countries then we will blur the lines between monetary policy and fiscal policy somewhat further” Weidmann said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Speaking to German politicians ahead of a weekend summit in Brussels to discuss Brexit she said in unusually frank language that she had \"the feeling that some in Britain still have illusions and that is a waste of time\". While Europe still envisions Britain as a close partner Mrs Merkel said once it leaves the EU it will be an outsider and as such \"can and will not have the same rights or be in a better position than a member of the European Union\". \"All of the 27 members of the European Union and European institutions are agreed upon that\" she said to applause. Britain has two years to complete its deal to leave the 28-nation European Union but is currently preoccupied with a snap election taking place in early June. Before the negotiations can even begin Mrs Merkel said Britain must engage in \"constructive dialogue\" with the EU to answer open questions. \"Without progress on the many open questions of the exit including the financial questions it makes no sense to have parallel negotiations over the future relationship\" she said. \"We need to know how Britain sees its future relations with us.\" She said Germany will push for the impact of Brexit on Germans and other European Union citizens living in Britain to be as minimal as possible and for co-operation on security issues like fighting organised crime and terrorism to remain close. \"Let there be no doubt: Brexit negotiations will demand a lot from Britain and Europe\" she said. She added that Germany and other EU countries need to define their own \"interests and goals\" and that she expects EU nations to emerge from the Brussels summit with a \"strong signal of unity\". \"There is now a great deal of agreement between the 27 nations and EU institutions about our joint negotiating line with Britain\" she said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Konrad Mizzi is confident common sense will prevail in talks between the EU and Britain not to leave the aviation industry in limbo after Brexit. The Tourism Minister yesterday weighed in on concerns raised by Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary that a deal looked very unlikely before Christmas 2018. Dr Mizzi said this was not a problem linked only to Malta but had far reaching consequences across the EU. “What is needed is an aviation agreement between the EU and Britain to replace the existing arrangements and our focus is to ensure this deal is reached” he said. With Britain slated to leave the EU by March 2019 the timing of such an agreement is crucial for the aviation sector to be able to plan ahead. Malta International Airport CEO Alan Borg has called for the matter to be dealt with by the government Brexit task force given that the United Kingdom market accounts for almost 27 per cent of passenger traffic to Malta. MIA’s half-yearly results released last week also confirmed Ryanair’s top spot for carrying passengers in and out of Malta. However Dr Mizzi was confident leaders would seek an arrangement to avoid disruptions for passengers. “I do not believe this will be a switch-on switch-off thing because it is hugely impractical to ground flights across Europe and I am sure common sense will prevail in the end and an agreement reached” he said. Mr O’Leary a critic of Britain’s decision to leave the European Union has warned that no agreement could cause major flight disruptions between Britain and Europe. Budget airlines like Ryanair which flourished after Europe’s skies were liberalised in the 1990s are likely to suffer the hardest hit in the absence of a deal that ensures planes departing from Britain continue to enjoy the same access rights to European airports. Mr O’Leary has said that without a deal Ryanair would move dozens of planes currently stationed in Britain to bases in other EU countries to continue flying. The sticking point is likely to concern the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice which British Prime Minister Theresa May has insisted is a red line. Formal Brexit talks started in June and negotiators have been slow to hammer out a deal on citizens’ rights which are first on the agenda before sectoral issues like aviation. kurt.sansone@timesofmalta.com \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet European Union chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker before dawn in Brussels on Friday as the two sides seek to clinch a deal to open talks on post-Brexit trade. May will meet the European Commission president at 0600 GMT with a news conference to follow half an hour to an hour later the commission said. May\\'s Downing Street office said she would travel with Brexit Secretary David Davis and also meet EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier. \"The prime minister is travelling to Brussels for further meetings on the Brexit negotiations\" a Downing Street spokeswoman said. EU and Irish officials had said earlier that Britain and Ireland could be hours from agreement on a text outlining how they would run their post-Brexit land border on the island of Ireland paving the way for a deal that would remove the last obstacle to opening free-trade talks with the European Union. A carefully choreographed attempt to showcase the progress of Brexit talks collapsed at the last minute on Monday when the Northern Irish party that props up May\\'s government vetoed a draft deal already agreed with the government in Dublin. Since then May has been scrambling to clinch a deal on the new UK-EU land border in Ireland that is acceptable to the European Union Dublin her own lawmakers and Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which keeps her government in power. DUP leader Arlene Foster negotiated through the early hours with May a DUP source told Reuters. Foster would make a statement later on Friday the source said. Juncker\\'s spokesman said late on Thursday: \"We are making progress but not yet fully there ... Talks are continuing throughout the night. Early morning meeting possible.\" A senior Irish official said talks were moving swiftly and that a deal was possible within hours. \"It is moving quite quickly at the moment\" the Irish official told a British Irish Chamber of Commerce event in Brussels. \"I think we are going to work over the next couple of hours with the UK government to close this off.\" \"I say hours because I think we are very close\" the official said. European Council President Donald Tusk\\'s role in plans for an accord would be to confirm that EU leaders will aim to agree at a summit next Friday to open trade talks in return for May making \"sufficient progress\" on the outline of a divorce package with the European Union. Moving to talks about trade and a Brexit transition are crucial for the future of May\\'s premiership and to keep trade flowing between the world\\'s biggest trading bloc and its sixth largest national economy after Britain leaves on March 30 2019. But the EU will only move to trade talks if there is enough progress on three key issues: the money Britain must pay to the EU; rights for EU citizens in Britain and British citizens in the EU; and how to avoid a hard border with Ireland. The EU says May has an effective deadline of Sunday night if she wants to seal a deal and hope to have agreement on trade talks in time for the EU summit on December 15. All sides say they want to avoid a return to a hard border between EU member Ireland and the British-ruled province of Northern Ireland which might upset the peace established after decades of violence. The DUP insists that Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom must leave the EU in the same way as the rest of the United Kingdom. To clinch a deal though May must ensure she has the support of the DUP whose leader told her bluntly on Monday that it would not support her minority government\\'s legislation unless the Irish border draft deal was changed. She must also convince her divided Conservative Party that the deal she makes is acceptable. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson a leader of the Brexit campaign insisted that the whole of the United Kingdom must \"take back control\" when it left the EU. \"Whatever way we devise for getting on to the body of the (Brexit) talks it\\'s got to be consistent with the whole of the United Kingdom taking back control of our laws of our borders and of our cash\" Johnson told reporters. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain’s third biggest company Unilever picked Rotterdam over London for its main headquarters yesterday in a blow to Prime Minister Theresa May’s government a year before Brexit. The Anglo-Dutch maker of Dove soap Lipton teas and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream launched a review of its dual-headed structure in 2017 after fighting off a $143 billion takeover from Kraft Heinz triggering a battle between Britain and the Netherlands. Under the new plan Unilever will continue to be listed in London Amsterdam and New York and will divide into three divisions keeping two based in Britain. That will enable it to retain its 7300 staff in the United Kingdom. The company said the decision to end 88 years of two parent-ownership was not linked to Brexit or any form of protectionism but would simplify its structure and facilitate acquisitions. However British unions and supporters of EU membership bemoaned what they said was a deterioration in Britain’s competitiveness at a time when tax code changes and strong anti-takeover laws have made the Netherlands increasingly attractive. “Let me categorically say that this had nothing to do with Brexit” Unilever chairman Marijn Dekkers told reporters. “The board takes a 30- to 50-year decision. We think both countries are highly attractive investment climates and we will continue to invest in both countries as a result of this” the Dutchman added. It is unclear whether Unilever can remain in the FTSE 100 Index of leading UK stocks a decision which could hit its shares if tracker funds are forced to sell. Forged by the 1930 merger of Dutch margarine producer Margarine Unie and British soap maker Lever Brothers Unilever employs nearly 170000 people around the world to generate turnover of €53.7 billion in 2017. In early 2017 the company – which had been thought to be too big to take over – managed to fight off one of the largest corporate bids ever made but had to placate investors with a plan to boost profits and reinvigoratethe group. The short-lived bid battle has had widespread repercussions. In the weeks after the offer chief executive Paul Polman said Britain known for promoting one of the most open economies in the world should do more to protect national champions. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s forthcoming exit from the European Union was the main reason for a 37% decline in new jobs available in London\\'s financial sector last month according to a report from recruiting firm Morgan McKinley released on Thursday. Financial services jobs new to the market in December fell to 3150 from 4980 in December 2016 the report said as uncertainty around the terms of Britain\\'s exit from the EU made companies in the city reluctant to hire. Many banks insurers and other financial firms are likely to be forced to move jobs if as expected Britain loses the EU \\'passport\\' mechanism \"Brexit clobbered the City\\'s workforce in 2017. Anyone sticking it out into 2018 is in it for the long haul\" said Hakan Enver operations director at Morgan McKinley Financial Services. Around 10000 finance jobs will be shifted out of Britain or created overseas in the next few years if the country is denied access to Europe\\'s single market according to a Reuters survey of firms employing the bulk of workers in international finance. London\\'s future as Europe\\'s premier financial hub is one of the biggest issues in Brexit talks because the sector is Britain\\'s biggest source of corporate tax revenue. Many banks insurers and other financial firms are likely to be forced to move jobs if as expected Britain loses the EU \\'passport\\' mechanism that allows them to sell their products freely within the bloc from London. The Morgan McKinley report is one of the starkest data points yet showing how hiring has slowed as firms struggle to get clarity on what access they will have to Europe\\'s financial markets following Brexit. The report also showed a decline in people seeking employment in the financial sector as the number of jobseekers in finance fell 30% year-on-year in December to 4594. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  The Bank of England has rejected calls from British lawmakers and insurers to ease a European Union insurance capital requirement rule blaming Brexit uncertainty. BOE deputy governor Sam Woods has studied possible changes to how the “risk margin” is calculated in EU rules known as Solvency II. It refers to what a third party would need to take over an insurer’s policies if it went bust. Lawmakers on parliament’s Treasury Select Committee said last October the rule should be changed because it was forcing insurers in Britain to reinsure business offshore to benefit from lower capital charges. The BOE has failed to persuade the EU to make speedy changes to the rule leaving it with an option of unilateral action that Woods has ruled out on citing Brexit. Woods considered ways to mitigate the impact of the risk margin and how it was calculated. “However in the context of the ongoing uncertainty about our future relationship with the EU in relation to financial services we do not yet see a durable way to implement a change with sufficient certainty for firms to be able to rely on it for pricing capital planning and use of reinsurance” he said in a letter to the Treasury Committee. “We will keep this position under review and will update the committee as soon as we can see a clear way forward.” British insurers called on the BOE in March to ease the rule which they say costs them £50 billion in extra capital charges. Huw Evans director general of the Association of British Insurers said he was very disappointed. “While it is a step forward for them to confirm a technical solution to the problem exists within the current Solvency II framework that only makes it more frustrating to hear that uncertainty about Brexit has prevented the regulator acting in a way that makes sense for UK plc” Evans said. Woods said the build-up of the stock of offshore reinsurance was an unintended consequence of the risk margin rule and if left unconstrained would become a significant prudential concern. “Our supervisory reviews of firms’ reinsurance activities have not however brought to light significant immediate concerns about the way in which that reinsurance is being conducted” he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Just 8% of voters felt the outlook for Britain's withdrawal from the EU had got better nearly a year after Theresa May triggered Article 50 while more than a third (37%) felt less optimistic about it and 47% did not change their view the ComRes/Sunday Mirror poll showed. And it appears many voters were turned off by high-profile interventions this week from the Prime Minister Jeremy Corbyn Tony Blair and Sir John Major. The big-hitters all made major speeches on Britain's withdrawal from the EU this week and while they did not change most voters' opinion more were turned off than enthused. Less than one in 10 (9%) had a better opinion of Mrs May after she set out her Brexit vision while more than a quarter (27%) said their impression of her had got worse. But most voters backed her strategy of continuing to negotiate with the EU (33%) to get the best exit deal for Britain while less than a quarter (22%) said she should walk away from talks. Less than one in five (19%) called for another general election so voters can choose between the Labour and Tory positions on Brexit. Her Mansion House address was preceded by Mr Corbyn's speech setting out Labour's backing of a customs union with the EU. But it left more than a quarter (29%) of voters with a worse opinion of the Labour leader while 13% said their view of him had improved. In a damning assessment of his strategy more people thought he should have ruled out a customs union (19%) than backed his approach (18%). But illustrating the difficult balancing act he faces uniting Labour Leave and Remain voters 15% said he should have gone further and backed single market membership while 16% thought he should have said nothing and let the Tories fight it out among themselves. Overall more voters think Britain's negotiating priority should be securing a free trade deal (30%) than controlling borders to curb EU migration (21%) while 22% called on the Government to ensure the country has the freedom to strike free trade deals around the world. One in five (20%) said the priority should be the freedom to make our own laws without Brussels' interference (20%) while only 7% thought an open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland was key. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s banks and insurers must plan for a \"hard\" Brexit in case a transition period is not in place next March a senior British regulator said on Thursday in a warning echoed by Brussels. \"With eight months until we exit the European Union in March 2019 it is important we all - regulators and industry - continue to plan for a range of scenarios\" said Nausicaa Delfas head of international strategy at the Financial Conduct Authority. \"Across the FCA together with colleagues from the Bank of England and the government we have been working to develop a number of safeguards and contingencies in the event of a hard Brexit to ensure that \\'day 1\\' works smoothly\" Delfas told an event held by TheCityUK. Britain and the EU have agreed on a transition deal bridging Brexit in March next year and the end of 2020 but it has yet to be ratified meaning financial firms based in Britain could face an abrupt end to EU market access. EU banking insurance and markets watchdogs have already warned their respective sectors to be ready for a hard Brexit. The bloc\\'s executive European Commission told EU states on Thursday to \"intensify preparedness\" for a potentially disruptive Brexit. Britain has said it and the EU should act to ensure that cross-border financial contracts like derivatives and insurance policies can still be serviced after March but the EU reiterated on Thursday that it won\\'t legislate for now. \"In relation to contracts at this juncture there does not appear to be an issue of a general nature linked to contract continuity as in principle even after withdrawal the performance of existing obligations can continue\" the European Commission said on Thursday. It is unclear what sort of EU market access financial firms in Britain will have after the transition period ends prompting many banks and insurers to have new hubs up and running in the bloc by next March to avoid potential disruption. A group of eight EU states also called for a redoubling of efforts to build a capital markets union in the bloc to provide \"stable and cost-effective\" funding for EU companies given that Britain Europe\\'s biggest financial centre is leaving. \\'DO YOUR OWN THING\\' Britain\\'s government wants future financial services trade with the EU based on an \"enhanced\" version of the bloc\\'s basic \"equivalence\" regime used by Japan Switzerland and the United States. Brussels alone grants access to foreign firms if it deems that their home country rules are equivalent or aligned enough with those in the bloc. Britain says this is one-sided and wants changes to make it more predictable and transparent. The EU is amending the regime but its alterations would make it tougher on big foreign trading and clearing firms like those found in the UK\\'s financial sector. Hugh Savill director of regulation at the Association of British Insurers said that even with enhanced equivalence the EU\\'s \"imperialist\" approach to rule-making would have a chilling effect on how UK regulators can supervise markets and consumers. \"Nobody wants to be in the position of a rule taker\" Delfas said. Antony Manchester head of Brexit at asset manager BlackRock <BLK.N> said enhanced equivalence can be made to work but Britain and the EU have different ideas on what it means. \"In these debates on equivalence... the UK and EU are quite evenly matched in terms of financial services. That means we will see something more like the negotiations between the EU and U.S. where we give and take on both sides\" Manchester said. But the EU and United States took four years to agree equivalence on a rules just for clearing derivatives raising concerns in Britain over what the City financial district could face after Brexit. Manchester a former UK Treasury official said if Brussels does not deem a UK firm to be equivalent British regulators could choose to \"do our own thing\" raising concerns about predictability for international financial firms. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

HSBC has shifted ownership of its Polish and Irish subsidiaries from its London-based entity to its French unit and will do so for seven more European branches as it prepares for Britain's exit from the European Union. HSBC France will also acquire the activities of seven European branches in Belgium the Czech Republic Ireland Italy Luxembourg the Netherlands and Spain Europe's biggest bank said on Wednesday. The move is aimed at ensuring HSBC can continue to serve its European customers ahead of Britain's exit from the EU in March 2019 after which British-based firms are expected to lose so-called passporting rights that allow them to sell financial services in the bloc. HSBC has not yet begun transferring any of the up to 1000 staff it has said could ultimately move to its French unit from Britain chief executive John Flint told Reuters on Monday. The change in its organisational structure in Europe shows HSBC putting its Brexit contingency plans into action in a sign of how banks are increasingly not waiting for the outcome of negotiations between Britain and the EU as to how financial services will operate between the two parties. While the HSBC branches and subsidiaries will still ultimately all be owned by its umbrella entity HSBC Holdings the move is significant in showing the bank pressing on with Brexit contingency plans. HSBC executives have since the Brexit vote in June 2016 maintained that the bank will be among the last to have to make such moves because it has a fully-licensed French banking subsidiary rather than branches that other banks have had to convert. Banks are choosing to go ahead with organising their businesses such that even in the 'no-deal' scenario under which Britain crashes out of the EU without any agreements in place they will still be able to serve European customers as before. British rival Lloyds Banking Group is planning three such subsidiaries in Europe Reuters reported last month while Barclays has made its Irish unit its new European hub while also shifting jobs to Frankfurt. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The pound is set to be stronger by the time Britain leaves the European Union according to currency strategists polled by Reuters but in a year it still won\\'t have come close to recouping its losses since the shock 2016 Brexit vote. Sterling is due to edge up more than 2 per cent against the dollar in six months - just after the March 29 2019 date when it is scheduled to leave - to around $1.33. It is then set to climb to $1.37 six months later according to the poll taken September 28-October 3 before Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Conservative Party conference speech on Wednesday. Forecast ranges in the survey were wide particularly on the 12-month horizon. But just two out of 64 forecasters said the pound would trade higher than where it was before the shock result in the June 2016 referendum at around $1.50. The 12-month consensus has fallen along with the pound since the April poll which was the first time forecasts for where sterling will be after the official leaving date were collected. Nearly every strategist has downgraded their view since then. That latest median 12-month view has the pound languishing about 9 per cent below $1.50. More than two years ago just before the referendum respondents correctly predicted in the Reuters foreign exchange poll that sterling would fall by about that much immediately afterward. So the view that Britain leaving the EU will result in a lasting not temporary devaluation appears to be holding. Trade and industry data show that depreciation has done relatively little to boost exports or make Britain more competitive in the meantime. For there to be any recovery in the pound from the current rate around $1.30 most foreign exchange analysts say there will need to be positive developments on the terms under which Britain will leave the world\\'s largest trading bloc. With the Bank of England set to keep interest rates on hold in the interim and mixed signals on economic performance a steadily-widening gap between UK rates and the US federal funds rate will also keep pressure on sterling. Still over 80 per cent of strategists polled say sterling will be higher in a year than where it is trading now. Optimists say there\\'s a lot of bad news - including talk of a \"no-deal\" Brexit - already priced in. \"Indeed the negatives surrounding deadlock Brexit negotiations and the UK government\\'s Chequers plan are largely priced into the currency\" notes Viraj Patel FX strategist at ING in London. Chequers Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s exit proposal that proposes to stay in the EU\\'s single market in goods but to diverge in services is unpopular in her own party. European Council President Donald Tusk says it \"will not work.\" In order for the pound to recover significantly there will also need to be decidedly more negative prospects for the US dollar which right now is standing tall as near-term prospects for the world\\'s largest economy look better than its peers. The last time sterling rallied in the period since the Brexit vote which took it above $1.43 and left many commentators scratching their heads at the time coincided with what turned out to be a passing weak period for the dollar. \"Political risks like Brexit and US trade disputes should continue to favor the USD over the GBP for the next three months\" note market strategists at UBS. \"A GBP rebound over 12 months remains possible however. We still expect a benign outcome for Brexit negotiations but the risk of a cliff-edge Brexit remains significant.\" There does not appear to be much confidence about how sterling will perform in the near-term either. Asked to gauge the risk that the pound will set a new post-Brexit low against the dollar before the end of March 2019 respondents were evenly split. The lowest point reached so far was just above $1.20 in early 2017. Against the euro the outlook for the pound is once again very subdued with narrow forecast ranges. Prospects for a decline against the currency of Britain\\'s main trading partner have recently been held in check as traders fretted over a stand-off between the Italian government and the European Commission over the size of Italy\\'s budget deficit. But the same Reuters poll found the euro is expected to be resilient in coming months. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The European Union\\'s chief negotiator warned Tuesday any extension of the Brexit talks would come at a cost to the bloc urging London not to take one for granted. Michel Barnier said when EU leaders meet to consider any request to postpone Brexit beyond March 29 they would expect Britain to explain why it might help. Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to send a letter in the coming hours to ask EU leaders to delay Brexit as Britain seeks an orderly divorce. The leaders who will meet May on Thursday at their Brussels summit are expected to approve an extension to avoid the chaos of a cliff-edge split. But it is still not clear whether May can command a House of Commons majority to approve the deal she signed in November and remains the only one available. Barnier told reporters the leaders would decide but that any \"long extension... should be linked to something new a new element or new political process.\" \"Extending the uncertainty without a clear plan would add to the economic cost for our businesses but could also incur a political cost for the EU\" he said. \"It is for the British government and parliament to decide very quickly what the UK wants to do next.\" If for example Britain wants a more ambitious plan for close economic and trade ties then that could be placed in the political declaration annexed to the deal. \"This political declaration which sets out the framework for our future relations could be made more ambitious in the coming days if a majority in the House of Commons so wishes\" he said. \"If not what would be the purpose and the outcome of an extension?\" he demanded. \"And how can we ensure that at the end of a possible extension we are not back in the same situation as today?\" If Britain does not approve the withdrawal agreement in the next 10 days or secure a delay then it will quit the EU and four-decades of legal and regulatory ties on March 29. Many observers predict political and economic chaos but Barnier - speaking after contingency talks with ministers from EU member states - put a brave face on things. \"On the EU side we are prepared\" he said. \"The European Parliament and the Council have now approved nearly all the foreseen contingency measures.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Shutterstock  Ireland will seek hundreds of millions of euros in aid from Brussels if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal the agriculture minister was quoted Thursday as saying. \"You\\'re looking at hundreds of millions here\" Michael Creed told the Irish Independent. \"Between the beef industry and the fishing industry we\\'re talking mega-money.\" With Westminster locked in stalemate over the painstakingly brokered draft Brexit deal the possibility of Britain leaving the trading bloc in March without an agreement now looms ever larger. The emergency aid for Ireland would aim to buttress sectors such as beef dairy and fishing - those most exposed to customs and regulatory changes likely to arise if Britain severs all ties. Nearly 80 per cent of Irish exporters deliver products to Britain according to 2016 government figures. The country is also considered a vital \"land bridge\" to the European continent. \"There is a high level of awareness of Ireland\\'s unique exposure to the UK food market\" Creed said. \"I think nobody wants to talk about it right now because there is still a hope and expectation that a level of sanity will prevail.\" But he added: \"In racing parlance the odds are slashed on a hard Brexit.\" If Britain crashes out of the European Union on March 29 Creed said he hoped an EU grant would be approved at a Luxembourg summit of EU farming ministers in April. On Thursday the Irish cabinet is to discuss no deal contingency plans aired publicly for the first time before the Christmas break. They include schemes for port overhauls a fund for Brexit-specific tax staff and talks to preserve the island\\'s integrated electricity network. Up to 45 pieces of emergency legislation would be required - an agenda likely to bring all other Irish parliamentary affairs in early 2019 to a grinding halt. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Updated 10.45 p.m with result of the indicative votes - Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday pledged to step down if MPs back her EU divorce deal in a bid to break the Brexit deadlock in Britain\\'s fractured parliament. Following months of pressure May told her Conservative MPs that she would quit if they see through the withdrawal agreement she painstakingly negotiated with Brussels. Her dramatic gambit came just two hours before MPs started a flurry of votes seeking a last-minute alternative Brexit plan to replace her deal. None of the alternatives - including the holding of a second referendum - found the support of a majority in the House. The motion on the holding a second referendum had 268 in favour and 295 MPs against. May said she would not lead the country in negotiations on the UK\\'s future relationship with the European Union once Britain is out of the bloc. Theresa May’s pledge to Tory MPs to stand down if they vote for her deal shows once and for all that her chaotic Brexit negotiations have been about party management not principles or the public interest.A change of government can\\'t be a Tory stitch-up the people must decide. \"This has been a testing time for our country and our party. We\\'re nearly there\" May told the packed closed-door meeting in parliament according to her Downing Street office. \"I know there is a desire for a new approach -- and new leadership -- in the second phase of the Brexit negotiations and I won\\'t stand in the way of that. \"But we need to get the deal through and deliver Brexit. I am prepared to leave this job earlier than I intended in order to do what is right for our country and our party. If Brexit ends up being forced through on the basis of a deal no one supports - indeed a deal so bad that the PM has to promise to resign to get it through - it will make an already bad project even worse. \"I ask everyone in this room to back the deal so we can complete our historic duty -- to deliver on the decision of the British people and leave the European Union with a smooth and orderly exit.\" - MPs vote on alternatives -Three years of political turmoil that followed Britain\\'s decision to break its near half-century bond with the EU were meant to have ended on Friday with the formal completion of the divorce. But no clear end is in sight and lawmakers have twice resoundingly rejected the agreement May concluded with Brussels over 17 months of acrimonious talks. Parliament tried to resolve the crisis by giving itself the right to choose from a variety of alternatives to May\\'s plan. It voted on eight options that ranged from a second referendum to recalling the EU withdrawal notice or leaving under much closer economic terms. None achieved a majority.\\xa0 House of Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said there was a \"real possibility\" that May will bring back her deal for a third vote on Thursday or Friday. But Commons Speaker John Bercow reminded May that he already scuppered her plan to hold a third vote last week because she was effectively bringing back the same rejected text. \"I do expect the government to meet the test of change\" Bercow told the chamber. - \\'Better than not leaving\\' -EU leaders have given Britain an extended deadline of April 12 to either salvage May\\'s deal or find a better way. Failure to do either could result in a no-deal divorce -- a scenario that frightens markets and businesses. If parliament does adopt May\\'s deal Britain is headed for the exit door on May 22. Britain could otherwise seek an even longer extension that puts it in the odd situation of having to take part in European Parliament elections nearly two months after it was supposed to have left. May will hope none of the alternatives earn majority support and that her own agreement ends up looking like the best option. She has already won the backing of Jacob Rees-Mogg who heads the European Research Group of hard Brexiteers in her party that twice voted against the deal. \"I think we\\'ve got to the point where legally leaving is better than not leaving at all\" he told BBC radio. European leaders are watching the entire process with concern. European Council President Donald Tusk urged EU lawmakers on Wednesday to remain open to a long postponement while Britain rethinks its stance. \"We should be open to a long extension if the UK wishes to rethink its Brexit strategy\" he said. \\xa0 School bus hijack children to get Italian nationality  Facebook moves to curb white nationalism separatism on platform \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The British government is to move Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit deal for a third vote in parliament on Friday to avoid a chaotic no-deal divorce from the EU. May\\'s throw of the dice comes a day after her dramatic pledge to resign in order to persuade her rivals to finally back her vision for breaking Britain\\'s 46-year bond with the European project. The government\\'s back is against the wall as it tries to avert potential economic disaster and financial panic in the coming weeks. British parliament speaker John Bercow gave his go-ahead for a vote by MPs. He had rejected a similar attempt last week after ruling that the version May was bringing back was essentially the same text that lawmakers had already twice rejected by resounding margins. But on Thursday he said the motion is new substantially different.\\xa0 Anxious EU leaders last week offered Britain a Brexit extension until May 22. But it is conditional on parliament voting through May\\'s deal by Friday -- the day Britain was originally scheduled to leave. Failure to pass the deal could mean a no-deal Brexit as early as April 12. Businesses fear that will cause economic chaos. To avoid that the British government must spell out what its next steps should be. Britain might then seek a much longer extension that would mean it has to hold European Parliament elections despite having voted to leave the bloc. - \\'Desire for new approach\\' -May\\'s handling of Brexit has provoked both anger and frustration as well as ridicule. She played what may have been her last political card on Wednesday by promising to quit once the messy divorce process is complete. \"I know there is a desire for a new approach -- and new leadership -- in the second phase of the Brexit negotiations and I won\\'t stand in the way of that\" May told a packed meeting of party members. Her promise won over some likely contenders for her job. May became premier shortly after the 2016 referendum in which Britons narrowly voted to leave the EU. Former foreign minister Boris Johnson said he would now back the premier \"on behalf of the 17.4 million people who voted for Brexit\". - No apologies -But the prime minister\\'s position was undermined when her allies in Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said they would continue to oppose the deal. The small party props up May\\'s minority government giving it a decisive role in the political saga that has consumed Britain and left its EU partners increasingly perplexed. The DUP is opposed to provisions in May\\'s deal to keep a free-flowing border between Britain\\'s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. The group worries that this would give Northern Ireland a different economic status from mainland Britain and separate it from the mainland. \"For us the most important thing is a union\" DUP leader Arlene Foster told RTE television Friday. \"I don\\'t make any apologies for that.\" Downing Street said Thursday that \"discussions with the DUP are continuing\" as the government tries to piece together a majority from a patchwork of conflicting interests. - No majority -Parliament has failed to rally round any new last-minute Brexit proposal. Parliament took the unprecedented step of assigning itself the right to vote on a multiple choice of alternate solutions to the deal May reached with Brussels after 17 months of talks. But none of the eight options secured a majority and another vote has been set for Monday on some of the proposals. The one that came closest to winning parliamentary support provided for a much closer economic union with the other 27 nations post-Brexit than the one the Conservative party platform allows. A proposal to hold a second referendum -- a popular idea with EU supporters -- came second while those promoting a cleaner break finished near the bottom. \\xa0 Iceland\\'s WOW Air budget carrier collapses cancels all flights India destroys satellite with a missile and creates debris field of \\'space junk\\' \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn would push ahead with Brexit and seek to renegotiate the terms if he won a snap election next year he said on Saturday in a blow to party supporters who want a second referendum. Like much of Britain Corbyn\\'s Labour party is deeply divided over Brexit with some senior lawmakers leading calls for a fresh vote and others representing areas that recorded the highest support for leaving the European Union in the 2016 plebiscite. Corbyn a Socialist with little passion for the EU has been reluctant to support a second referendum or People\\'s Vote but with less than 100 days to go until Brexit the clamour is growing for either a delay or a second vote to prevent Britain leaving without a deal. \"You\\'d have to go back and negotiate and see what the timetable would be\" the 69-year-old told the Guardian newspaper when asked what he would do if he won an early election designed to break the deadlock in parliament. Asked what stance Labour would take if a referendum were held Corbyn said: \"it would be a matter for the party to decide what the policy would be; but my proposal at this moment is that we go forward trying to get a customs union with the EU in which we would be able to be proper trading partners.\" Brtain due to leave EU on March 29 Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29. Prime Minister Theresa May has struck a withdrawal agreement with Brussels but was forced to pull a parliamentary vote on it last week after admitting she would lose by a large margin. A new election is not due until 2022 but one could be called if May fails to get her primary policy through parliament. Labour wants a permanent customs union with the EU and a close relationship with its lucrative single market. The policy has been dubbed \"constructive ambiguity\" by some who question whether Labour could negotiate a better deal. Critics argue that Corbyn has been happy to go along with the policy as long as the vote to leave the bloc is respected. He told the Guardian he still had concerns about EU rules on state aid and that he had to balance the views of all those in the party and understand why so many voted to leave the world\\'s biggest trading bloc. He said his plan for a customs union with the EU to protect trade and access to the market was designed to do just that. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May unveils her Brexit \"Plan B\" to parliament on Monday after MPs shredded her EU divorce deal deepening the political gridlock 10 weeks from departure day. Britain will crash out of the European Union on March 29 unless MPs can force a delay or come up with an alternative plan that Brussels is also happy with before the deadline. London and Brussels have spent the best part of two years working on the divorce deal but MPs in parliament\\'s lower House of Commons comprehensively rejected it on Tuesday. EU leaders have signalled they could alter the agreement if May dropped some of her negotiating \"red lines\" but British media on Monday reported that she would instead attempt to negotiate some changes to the existing agreement. The reports were met with scepticism in Europe. \"I don\\'t think it can be saved by marginal adjustments in the current plan. I don\\'t think she can convince MPs by presenting the same thing to them with slight tweaks\" Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said in Brussels. \"It therefore has to present something substantially different.\" Asked if he would change the Brexit deal Slovakia\\'s Miroslav Lajcak said: \"Why? So you want the EU to be a bigger loser than the UK? Is this what you really want? \"This is a fair deal that 27 members strongly support so I would really not touch\" he said. After surviving a Commons confidence vote on Wednesday May last week reached out to opposition parties to seek a compromise solution but the talks appear to have fallen through. Jeremy Corbyn leader of the main opposition Labour Party stayed away saying that a \"no-deal\" departure must be ruled out first -- something May says is impossible. - Amendments -After May sets out her plans for the way ahead lawmakers are set to table a series of amendments to be voted upon on January 29. At least two groups of MPs are planning to table amendments to enable backbenchers to delay Brexit and prevent Britain leaving the EU with no agreement. One of the proposals would enable MPs to debate and vote on Brexit issues giving them far greater influence over government strategy. May\\'s Downing Street office has called them \"extremely concerning\". \"You\\'ve got a Leave population and a Remain parliament\" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox one of the senior Brexiteers in May\\'s cabinet said on Sunday. \"Parliament has not got the right to hijack the Brexit process... and in fact steal the result from the people\" he told BBC television. Britain voted by a 52-48 margin in favour of leaving the EU in a referendum in 2016 that exposed deep divisions in British society. - Irish backstop -One of the most problematic areas of the divorce deal is the so-called backstop on the Irish border -- a legal guarantee that the frontier would remain free-flowing if Britain and the EU cannot agree a long-term free trade pact. Changes in the backstop could help win over Conservative eurosceptics and the party\\'s Democratic Unionist allies that May counts upon for a majority in parliament. Graham Brady who chairs the committee of backbench Conservative MPs said he thought May could get her Brexit deal past Conservative rebels if the Irish backstop \"can be sorted out\". \"So much of the vote against was from people who simply cannot support a potentially permanent backstop if that can be sorted out then I think we might get that withdrawal agreement through\" he told BBC radio. He said it was in Ireland\\'s interests to help Britain leave the EU with a deal saying they would be far more hurt by a no-deal Brexit that Britain as most of their trade comes through the UK. But Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said Sunday that he and Prime Minister Leo Varadkar were in no mood to support alterations to the withdrawal agreement (WA) or the backstop. \"We remain united and focused on protecting Ireland\" he said. \"That includes continued support for the EU/UK agreed WA in full including the backstop as negotiated.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May is pinning Brexit hopes on fresh talks with EU leaders after winning a mandate from lawmakers to try to renegotiate a deal - even if Brussels insists it will not budge. May\\'s dramatic decision to abandon a pact she herself sealed with the 27 EU leaders at a summit last month came with Britain on course to crash out of the bloc in political and economic chaos on March 29. MPs late Tuesday voted through an amendment saying they would only support a divorce deal if its controversial \"backstop\" clause to keep the Irish border open was removed. A spokesman for EU Council President Donald Tusk however swiftly said the Brexit deal was \"not open for renegotiation\" while French President Emmanuel Macron said it was the \"best agreement possible\". MPs also voted in favour of a non-binding measure that \"rejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement\". But they failed to vote through a more important plan - backed by European supporters - that would have tried to force through a Brexit delay if no new deal with the EU emerged by February 26. \"I agree that we should not leave without a deal. However simply opposing no-deal is not enough to stop it\" May told MPs. \"The government will now redouble its efforts to get a deal that this house can support.\" After the votes opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ready to meet May to discuss a \"sensible Brexit solution that works for the whole country\". \"After months of refusing to take the chaos of no-deal off the table the prime minister must now face the reality that no-deal is not an option\" he said. Brussels challenge May now faces a formidable challenge convincing Brussels to re-open talks that took 18 excruciating months to conclude. She said parliament\\'s approval of the backstop amendment gave her the \"mandate\" to \"seek to obtain legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement\". But she conceded that there was \"limited appetite\" in the EU for renegotiation. Parliament on January 15 had voted against the draft deal by a crushing margin. That significantly raised the risk that Britain\\'s departure without a plan on March 29 will create trade and economic disruptions on both sides of the Channel. Brexit hardliners from May\\'s Conservative party think the backstop - created to keep the border open with Ireland - could see Britain indefinitely tied to EU trade rules. The winning amendment calls for the backstop to be replaced with \"alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border\" - vague wording that did not pin May to any specific approach. Playing for time? British newspapers were divided on the outcome with the pro-Brexit Daily Mail hailing \"Theresa\\'s Triumph\" saying May had \"secured a dramatic victory\". The pro-Remain Guardian however pointed to problems ahead saying in an editorial that May\\'s victory was \"a pyrrhic success built on fantasy\". Analysts also struggled to see how May could convince her EU counterparts to agree to any changes. \"The only strategy I can see behind all this is the prime minister uses this to finally prove to all but her most recalcitrant backbenchers that the backstop cannot be renegotiated\" King\\'s College London professor Anand Menon said. \"She is going to have to come back definitely and say this deal isn\\'t on offer\" Menon said. University College London professor Morten Ravn agreed that May appeared to be playing for time. \"May won support for an amendment that she probably expects she cannot deliver on in the hope that parliament will support her deal last minute in order to avoid no-deal Brexit\" Ravn told AFP. May promised to give MPs a chance to vote on what happens next on February 14 should she fail to win a new agreement over the course of the next two weeks. \\'Groundhog Day\\' May already tried and failed to wrest new concessions from Brussels during a difficult summit last month that exposed her weak negotiating position - and the European Union\\'s resolve. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier\\'s deputy Sabine Weyand on Monday remarked that the current political debate in Britain felt \"like Groundhog Day\". She said Britain risked crashing out of the EU without a deal \"by accident\" because London cannot decide what it wants. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he hoped the backstop would \"never be used\" or be replaced quickly by a new trade agreement. \"But it is necessary and tonight\\'s developments at Westminster do nothing to change this\" he tweeted. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British MPs will vote on Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s EU withdrawal deal on January 15 the government said Tuesday while denying growing speculation it might seek to delay Brexit if the agreement is rejected. May postponed an initial vote last month in the face of opposition from all sides of the House of Commons but has now set it for next Tuesday evening after 1900 GMT following five days of debate which start on Wednesday. May is still struggling to convince both opposition lawmakers and her own Conservative party to back the divorce agreement heightening fears Britain could leave the European Union on March 29 without a deal. She has promised to secure further assurances from the EU on the most controversial elements of the Brexit deal relating to Northern Ireland and has held talks with European leaders in recent days. \"The work to secure those assurances is ongoing\" her spokesman said adding that the prime minister hoped to have something to offer MPs before next week\\'s vote. May is hosting several drinks parties for lawmakers this week in a bid to win them round arguing her deal is the best compromise that ends EU membership while protecting jobs. Environment Secretary Michael Gove told cabinet colleagues that critics holding out for a better deal were like swingers in their mid-50s waiting for Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson to turn up on a date. But with opposition among MPs still strong there is growing speculation London could seek to delay the EU\\'s two-year Article 50 exit process to allow more time to get the deal through parliament. An EU diplomatic source told AFP that \"we are convinced that Theresa May will request a postponement if the agreement is rejected in the British parliament.\" But May\\'s spokesman insisted: \"We will not be extending Article 50. \"There are people in the European Union who are discussing this issue but that is not the position of the UK government.\" \\'Very hypothetical\\' The other 27 EU leaders have repeatedly said they will not reopen the deal struck with Britain in November which covers key separation issues such as money and expatriate citizens\\' rights. But they issued a joint statement at an EU summit last month emphasising the temporary nature of the so-called backstop arrangement designed to keep open the UK border with Ireland after Brexit. And Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told the Irish Times there were discussions on whether the EU could offer \"a further set of written guarantees explanations and assurances\". The backstop would keep open the border between British Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit by temporarily aligning Britain with EU trade rules. Eurosceptic Conservatives and Northern Ireland\\'s tiny Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which props up May\\'s government fear it could tie London to Brussels for years to come. However France\\'s Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau said \"there is nothing more that we can do\" -- and warned against putting too much faith in talk of extending Article 50. \"I don\\'t work on hypotheses -- the current situation is complex enough... Let\\'s stick to where we are now\" she said. An EU diplomat also told AFP that the idea of delaying Brexit \"is a very hypothetical option\". Any extension to Britain\\'s departure would be complicated by the elections to the European Parliament in May. After Brexit it will no longer be represented in the assembly. No deal plans May is looking at a possible time limit to the backstop arrangement and increased parliamentary scrutiny to try to sway MPs. But if her efforts fail many fear Britain could leave the EU with no deal with potentially disastrous legal and economic consequences. A cross-party group of MPs on Tuesday voted to amend a finance law to limit the government\\'s tax-raising powers in the event of \"no deal\" in an attempt to avert such a scenario. Downing Street said earlier that the amendment while \"not desirable\" was an \"inconvenience rather than anything more significant\". The impact of a disorderly Brexit would also be felt across Europe including in the EU budget. May\\'s deal sets out plans for a post-Brexit transition period in which Britain would keep making financial contributions until December 2020. EU budget commissioner Gunther Oettinger said that without this \"we would be short a figure in the billions of euros for the rest of the year and a higher figure for 2020\". \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May\\xa0will on Monday repeat weekend warnings to MPs poised to reject her EU divorce deal that failing to deliver Brexit would be \"catastrophic\" for British democracy. On the eve of Tuesday\\'s monumental vote in parliament on her withdrawal agreement - forged from 18 months of gruelling negotiations with European leaders - May is set to address factory workers in Stoke a Brexit-backing city in central England. The embattled leader who is widely expected to lose the House of Commons vote by a wide margin will make a final bid for support by arguing: \"We all have a duty to implement the result of the referendum. \"I ask MPs to consider the consequences of their actions on the faith of the British people in our democracy\" May is expected to say according to excerpts of her speech released by her office. \"What if we found ourselves in a situation where parliament tried to take the UK out of the EU in opposition to a remain vote?\" she will ask. \"People\\'s faith in the democratic process and their politicians would suffer catastrophic harm.\" \\'No confidence in the government\\'\\xa0 Britain is set to leave the European Union on March 29 but with less than 11 weeks left has yet to finalise the terms of its departure. May\\'s deal agrees a 21-month transition period under current terms while the future relationship with the bloc is negotiated but it has drawn steadfast opposition from both Brexiteers and Remainers.\\xa0 The prime minister has said rejecting it will throw Britain into \"uncharted territory\" and put the country at risk of crashing out without an agreement or even no Brexit at all. The opposition Labour Party which favours remaining in a permanent customs union with the EU has suggested it will seek a no-confidence vote in the government if MPs throw out the plan. The Observer newspaper reported Sunday that its lawmakers have been told it could be tabled \"within hours\" of that on Tuesday with the confidence vote to be held the following day. If the government lose a no-confidence motion there will be a period of 14 days in which parties can seek to find an alternative working majority in parliament. If they fail to do so a general election would be called. \"We will table a motion of no confidence in the government at a time of our choosing but it\\'s going to be soon don\\'t worry about it\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the BBC on Sunday. Corbyn conceded if the party won power parliament would likely need to delay Brexit beyond March 29 so it could renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. \\'A very British coup\\' The prime minister already postponed a House of Commons vote on her plan in December to avoid defeat -- and MPs look set to reject it again on Tuesday. Lawmakers who believe it either leaves Britain too close or too distant from the bloc fired ominous warning shots this week voting to force the prime minister to quickly set out an alternative plan for Brexit if she loses the vote. It was her second setback in 24 hours after MPs also voted to deny the government certain taxation powers in a no-deal scenario -- in a bid to avoid such an outcome.\\xa0 The Sunday Times said a group of senior cross-party backbench rebels are now plotting to change House of Commons rules to enable them to override government business if the deal falls. Described as \"a very British coup\" the plan would see May lose control of parliamentary business to MPs threatening her ability to govern the newspaper said.\\xa0 It said Downing Street was \"extremely concerned\" about the possibility which could see lawmakers then delay Brexit through new legislation.\\xa0 Conservative MP Nick Boles who favours a Norway-style relationship which would keep Britain in the EU\\'s single market told the paper he was exploring tactics in the Commons to rule out a no-deal scenario. \"We have a mechanism which will give parliament control of the Brexit negotiations and ensure we do not leave the EU without a deal on March 29\" he said. \"I am working on ways to achieve that outcome\" Boles said indicating he would publish the plan on Tuesday. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May asked MPs on Tuesday to give her more time to try and revive her Brexit deal with the EU in what the opposition said was a ploy to \"run down the clock\". May updated parliament following meetings in Belfast Brussels and Dublin despite EU leaders\\' insistence that they will not renegotiate the deal they had already struck with her. Deal or no deal Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29 and a disorderly exit could cause chaos. \"The talks are at a crucial stage. We now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this House requires and deliver Brexit on time\" May told lawmakers. \"Having secured an agreement with the EU for further talks we now need some time to complete that process\" she said. The announcement was seen by political commentators as an attempt to defuse any parliamentary rebellion in a series of votes on May\\'s Brexit strategy to be held on Thursday. May has promised that parliament would have another chance to vote on February 27 on what to do if no agreement is reached. - \\'Play chicken\\' -MPs last month overwhelmingly rejected the deal struck between May and Brussels for Britain\\'s exit from the EU. Ever since the premier has been trying to secure changes to the accord that would satisfy parliament\\'s lower House of Commons. Pro-Brexit MPs in May\\'s Conservative Party are unhappy particularly with a so-called backstop provision intended to keep the border with Ireland free-flowing. Some fear it could leave Britain trapped in EU trade rules indefinitely with no withdrawal mechanism. Main opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said May had come to parliament Tuesday with \"excuses and delays\" and accused her of trying to \"play chicken with people\\'s livelihoods\". \"It appears the prime minister has just one real tactic: to run down the clock hoping members of this house are blackmailed into supporting a deeply flawed deal\" he said. \"This is an irresponsible act.\\xa0She\\'s playing for time and playing with people\\'s jobs.\" - Plea for time -Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said the onus was on the EU to show flexibility. \"It would be an extraordinary outcome if the thing that the backstop is seeking to avoid which is a hard border in Northern Ireland if the EU were so determined to be completely intransigent about it that they actually incur the very thing that they\\'re seeking to avoid by pushing the UK into a position where we leave without a deal\" she told BBC radio. If no transition deal is in place when Britain leaves the EU it could trigger economic shockwaves around the continent. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and David Lidington May\\'s de facto deputy met members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg Tuesday while British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was in Paris as part of a diplomatic offensive. Hunt said he had \"open and thoughtful discussions\" with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. \"Both sides want a Brexit deal that supports ongoing friendship between UK/EU/France so patience and goodwill on backstop now the critical ingredient\" he tweeted. - Pressure on the opposition -Meanwhile students supporting a second referendum urged Corbyn to \"get off the fence\" on Brexit in a stunt in his north London constituency. Many of Labour\\'s younger newer supporters who propelled the veteran socialist to the party leadership want to stay in the EU -- but many of the seats Labour holds in parliament are in pro-Brexit hotbeds. \"A lot of people have noticed the complete lack of opposition on this\" said Kira Millana Lewis an 18-year-old student and Labour member. \"We believed in him because we believed he would offer us a brighter future. That isn\\'t possible outside of the European Union.\"\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Theresa May has been accused of being \"too weak\" to face down hard Brexiteers in her party after more than 60 Tories set out their demands for the next stage of exit talks. The Prime Minister will hold a crunch meeting with senior Cabinet ministers on Thursday to thrash out an agreement on how to proceed in negotiations with the European Union. In a letter Conservative MPs warned the UK must have full control over laws after Brexit and must not become a \"rule taker\". Britain must not be stopped from negotiating and signing trade deals during any transition period they said. The letter was sent by the European Research Group (ERG) made up of Tory Eurosceptics and was signed by 62 MPs including former Cabinet ministers Priti Patel and Iain Duncan Smith. It includes a number of \"suggestions\" for securing a successful Brexit including \"taking control\" of World Trade Organisation tariff schedules that regulate trading. The Government should publish a mandate showing how the UK wants to approach trade with the rest of the world. \"The UK must be free to start its own trade negotiations immediately\" the letter adds. \"The UK should negotiate as an equal partner. Ministers may not want or be able to accept the EU\\'s timing and mandates as fixed and should be able to set out alternative terms including for example building an agreement based on our World Trade Organisation membership instead. \"Any \\'implementation period\\' should be based on WTO principles. Any implementation period must not restrain the UK from negotiating or signing other trade agreements.\" Mrs May is meeting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte for talks in Downing Street and is expected to update him on Brexit progress. Labour said the letter exposed the \"deep divisions\" in the Conservative Party. Paul Blomfield shadow Brexit minister said: \"It is clearer than ever that Theresa May cannot deliver the Brexit deal Britain needs. She is too weak to face down the fanatics in her own party and to deliver a final deal that protects jobs and the economy. \"She is too weak to face down the fanatics in her own party and to deliver a final deal that protects jobs and the economy.\" Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron a supporter of the Best For Britain against Brexit said: \"It seems the Prime Minister has one arm tied behind her back by the Tory militants who are now nakedly acting like a party within a party. \"Not satisfied with hijacking the referendum result for their own extreme ends now May\\'s militants now called Maymentum are hijacking the Conservative Party - one nation pro business common sense Tories must fight back for the good of our country. \"And the PM must listen to the people not to the far-right faction who are launching this shameless coup.\" SNP foreign affairs spokesman Stephen Gethins said: \"The process for leaving the EU has been hijacked by hard right Tories whose agenda for Brexit at any costs will be devastating for us all in terms of jobs the economy and opportunities for young people in the future. \"It is clear from this list of demands that the Tories don\\'t want either a transition deal or a future relationship with the EU. It is time for the Prime Minister to put country before party and say no to her hard right Brexiteers.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May vowed to fight for her draft divorce deal with the European Union on Thursday after the resignation of her Brexit secretary and other ministers put her strategy and her job in peril. Just over 12 hours after May announced that her cabinet had agreed to the terms of the deal Brexit minister Dominic Raab and work and pensions minister Esther McVey resigned. Eurosceptics in May\\'s Conservative Party said they had submitted letters calling for a vote of no confidence in her leadership. May called a news conference at her Downing Street residence to underline her determination to stay the course. Asked if she would contest any challenge to her position she replied: \"Am I going to see this through? Yes.\" However hostility from government and opposition lawmakers raised the risk that the deal would be rejected in parliament and that Britain could leave the EU on March 29 without a safety net. That prospect pushed the pound down as much as 2% to $1.2731 although it recovered slightly after May\\'s statement. The main stock index in Ireland which is highly dependent on trade with Britain plunged 3.8%. The German carmaker BMW which produces its Mini model in Britain said that with the political situation so uncertain it would continue to prepare for a \\'no-deal\\' Brexit. \\'Best deal for Britain\\' Customers watch television sets broadcasting a news conference by Britain\\'s Prime Minister Theresa May in London. Two junior ministers two ministerial aides and the Conservatives\\' vice chairman joined Raab and McVey in quitting. May said she understood their unhappiness but added: \"I believe with every fibre of my being that the course I have set out is the right one for our country and all our people ... \"I am going to do my job of getting the best deal for Britain.\" By seeking to preserve the closest possible ties with the EU May has upset her party\\'s many advocates of a clean break and Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which props up her minority government. Meanwhile proponents of closer relations with the EU in her own party and the Labour opposition say the deal squanders the advantages of membership for little gain. Both sides say it effectively cedes power to the EU without securing the promised benefits of greater autonomy. \"It is... mathematically impossible to get this deal through the House of Commons. The stark reality is that it was dead on arrival\" said Conservative Brexit-supporting lawmaker Mark Francois. The deal will need the backing of about 320 of parliament\\'s 650 MPs to pass. The ultimate outcome remains uncertain. Scenarios include May\\'s deal ultimately winning approval; May losing her job; Britain leaving the bloc with no agreement; or even another referendum. \\'Worse than anticipated\\' Analysts from US bank Citi said Britain was now likely either to stay in the EU or leave without a deal. Jacob Rees-Mogg the leader of a Conservative eurosceptic group in parliament said the draft was \"worse than anticipated\" and he had formally requested a vote of no confidence in May. At least 14 Conservative lawmakers openly said they had submitted such letters although others could have done so secretly. Forty-eight are needed to trigger a challenge. But May told parliament: \"The choice is clear. We can choose to leave with no deal we can risk no Brexit at all or we can choose to unite and support the best deal that can be negotiated.\" Rees-Mogg told journalists the next prime minister should be someone who believed in Brexit. But a May ally former interior minister Amber Rudd told Sky News: \"The problem isn\\'t the prime minister. The problem is the challenges she\\'s got to deliver in trying to pull together this Brexit. She\\'s the best person to do it.\" The Labour Party said the government was \"falling apart\". \\'No ability to exit\\' In parliament lawmakers from all sides spent three hours mostly attacking the draft agreed with the EU on Tuesday after more than a year of difficult negotiations. \"No democratic nation has ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime imposed externally without any democratic control over the laws to be applied nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement\" Raab said in his resignation letter. Others said the so-called \"Irish backstop\" to be used if no better way can be found to avoid future checks on the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland would tear Britain apart leaving Northern Ireland all but inside the EU\\'s single market. It was this arrangement which sees Britain and the EU establishing a single customs territory but Northern Ireland aligned more closely with the EU that spurred most criticism. The DUP has threatened to pull its support from the minority government if the backstop means the province is treated differently from mainland Britain. EU leaders are ready to meet on November 25 to sign off on the divorce deal or Withdrawal Agreement but French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe summed up the uncertainty when he said events in London raised concerns about whether it would be ratified. \"We need to prepare ourselves for a no-deal Brexit\" he said. A group of EU states including France also raised objections to what has been agreed so far on fishing between the EU and UK after Brexit diplomatic sources said. Raab 44 was named Brexit secretary in July after the resignation of his predecessor David Davis who also quit in protest at May\\'s strategy. At the heart of Raab\\'s criticism was the belief that the pursuit of a temporary customs union with the EU would be the starting point for talks on the future relationship with the bloc \"severely prejudicing\" what Britain could achieve. He said he could not support an indefinite backstop arrangement and that May\\'s plan threatened the integrity of the United Kingdom. \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Theresa May will unveil plans to enshrine all European Union regulations that apply to Britain in domestic law when the country leaves the bloc at her first Conservative Party conference as Prime Minister. She will tell Tories in Birmingham that a \"Great Repeal Bill\" will scrap the 1972 European Communities Act which gives direct effect to all EU law and at the same time convert Brussels regulations into domestic law. This will give Parliament the power to unpick the laws it wants to keep remove or amend at a later date in a move that could be welcomed by MPs keen to have a say over the terms of Brexit. The move is also designed to give certainty to businesses and protection for workers\\' rights that are part of EU law. Mrs May told The Sunday Times: \"This marks the first stage in the UK becoming a sovereign and independent country once again. \"It will return power and authority to the elected institutions of our country. It means that the authority of EU law in Britain will end.\" Brexit Secretary David Davis will tell the conference: \"To those who are trying to frighten British workers saying \\'when we leave employment rights will be eroded\\' I say firmly and unequivocally \\'no they won\\'t\\'.\" The Bill is expected to be brought forward in the next parliamentary session (2017-18) and will not pre-empt the two-year process of leaving the EU which begins when the Government triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Mr Davis will say: \"It\\'s very simple. At the moment we leave Britain must be back in control. And that means EU law must cease to apply. \"To ensure continuity we will take a simple approach. EU law will be transposed into domestic law wherever practical on exit day. \"It will be for elected politicians here to make the changes to reflect the outcome of our negotiation and our exit. \"That is what people voted for: power and authority residing once again with the sovereign institutions of our own country.\" The repeal Bill will end the primacy of EU law meaning rulings by the European Court of Justice will stop applying to the UK once the legislation takes effect. It will include powers to make changes to the laws using secondary legislation as negotiations over the UK\\'s future relationship proceed although more wide-ranging amendments or new laws may come forward in separate Bills. Mrs May made clear she does not want the conference to be dominated by the issue of leaving the EU and has taken the unusual step of scheduling two conference speeches on Brexit on Sunday before delivering the traditional leader\\'s speech to close the conference on Wednesday. But it may prove difficult with Tory MPs divided between favouring a \"hard Brexit\" outside the European single market to obtain complete control over immigration or remaining in or having close access to the free trade zone but potentially having to comply with some EU rules. \"I\\'m clear that we are not going to be completely consumed by Brexit\" the Prime Minister told the Sun on Sunday. But in a sign of the debates that could dominate the fringes of the event former education secretary Nicky Morgan will warn against interpreting the Brexit vote as \"giving a licence to harsher rhetoric and returning to policies which have been rejected in the past\" according to the Observer. Meanwhile Mrs May suggested seeking advice from her predecessor David Cameron was not on her list of priorities having not spoken to him for 62 days after taking office. \"It\\'s not that I haven\\'t been talking to him\" she said. \"I spent some time doing the key things that were important.\" Mr Cameron\\'s former spin doctor Sir Craig Oliver revealed that the former prime minister had considered in the run-up to the referendum telling voters that he wanted Britain to stay in the EU but also seek curbs on immigration. But Mr Cameron ditched plans to seek fresh concessions in a phone call with German chancellor Angela Merkel 10 days before the referendum Sir Craig said. In the latest serialisation of his book Unleashing Demons: The Inside Story Of Brexit in the Mail on Sunday Sir Craig said: \"The idea was to test the water to see if we can agree to make plain that much more will be done on immigration. \"But as the time approaches we realise it is a fool\\'s errand. Even supposing a magical plan can be set in train - and it certainly isn\\'t - it will look desperate.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nApr 3rd 07:56  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters  The stakes will be high for Britain’s historic role as a free-trading nation when it holds a referendum on whether to stay in the European Union on June 23. There is no precedent for an economy as big as Britain’s leaving a trade bloc and the rival campaigns paint contrasting pictures of what quitting the EU might mean for its trade. Below are some of the main issues around the potential risks or benefits for British trade of a so-called Brexit. Britain’s most important trade partnership is with the EU’s single market the world’s biggest trade area. Campaigners seeking to keep Britain in the EU say it would be in a weak negotiating position if it left and then sought to hammer out a trade agreement with its former partners something many “out” campaigners say they want. Government figures show 12.6 per cent of Britain’s economic output is linked to exports to the EU’s 27 other members for whom only 3.1 per cent of output is linked to exports to Britain. Pascal Lamy a former head of the World Trade Organisation said a post-Brexit Britain would probably have to resort to raising its import tariffs on EU and other countries’ goods or restricting access to its market in services in order to gain some muscle for trade talks that could last as long as a decade. “Britain would have to say ‘Sorry consumers but you have to pay more’. It’s just crazy” said Lamy an ex-EU trade chief. In return for a trade deal the EU would want Britain to make contributions into its budget and to keep on allowing EU citizens to work on its soil – two big concerns for the Brexit camp. It could also face a long battle to ensure its banking industry did not face hurdles doing business in Europe. “Out” campaigners say the EU would probably be reluctant to reward a breakaway Britain with a trade deal but would not want to impede its firms from selling into the world’s fifth-biggest economy by raising tariffs or imposing tough new regulations. They say the boot would even be on Britain’s foot because in value terms EU exports of goods and services to Britain were worth £289 billion in 2014 substantially more than Britain’s £230 billion of exports the other way. Contrasting pictures of what quitting the EU might mean “Commercial imperatives are very powerful much more powerful than politicians” William Dartmouth deputy chairman of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said. If a deal could not be reached and WTO-compliant tariffs were imposed on trade between Britain and the EU they would be low enough not to impede business Dartmouth predicted. Tariffs agreed by the EU with the WTO for imports from countries outside the bloc stand at below five per cent on over a third of factory goods but have been abolished on about 30 per cent more; the EU has a nearly 10 per cent tariff on cars a big British export. A breakaway Britain would also need to renegotiate its WTO membership terms with all WTO members including some with which Britain has frosty relations such as Russia and Argentina. The Brexit camp says the EU moves too slowly on trade and Britain on its own would strike deals more quickly. The big prizes would be agreements with heavyweights such as the United States India and China none of which have full trade pact with the EU to date. But others warn that Britain with a population of 60 million people would go into talks in a weaker position on its own than as part of the 500-million strong EU. “It’s not a question of being smart or not. At the end of the day it depends on how much clout you have” said Arancha Gonzalez head of the International Trade Centre a joint agency of the United Nations and the WTO. A 2013 trade deal between Switzerland and China which some Brexit supporters say shows what Britain might achieve on its own got rid of tariffs on 99.8 per cent of Chinese exports to Switzerland immediately compared with 77.3 per cent of Swiss exports to China rising to nearly 90 per cent by 2028. Fredrik Erixon at think tank ECIPE in Brussels said a UK-China deal could provide big gains for British exporters and investors but might come at the cost of Britain providing China with privileged status as an investor or more political support. Simon Evenett a trade professor at St Gallen University in Switzerland said Britain might be able to do a deal quickly with Brazil because it does not share the concerns of other EU countries about Brazil’s ambitions to export more farm goods. But he said India could repeat a demand it made in trade talks with the EU – namely that more of its skilled workers be given work visas touching on a sensitive issue for many Brexit supporters for whom high levels of immigration are a concern. Furthermore as for the United States its top trade official said last year Washington’s focus was on deals with regional groups not individual nations. And as well as seeking to open up new markets a post-Brexit Britain would face the challenge of regaining the preferential trade access it currently has with over 50 countries under EU deals ranging from Mexico to Egypt and Ukraine. The European Commission has exclusive competence to forge trade deals on behalf of the bloc. If Britain left it would have to create its own negotiating team able to handle the wide range of complex issues immediately on the agenda. Only a few of the 55 British officials in the European Commission’s trade department actually work on trade deals. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Issei Kato/Reuters  A post-Brexit trade deal between Britain and the EU might take 10 years to finalise and could still fail the UK’s ambassador to the bloc has told Prime Minister Theresa May’s government the BBC reported yesterday. Ivan Rogers Britain’s envoy to the EU warned ministers that the European consensus was that a deal might not be done until the early to mid-2020s and that national parliaments could ultimately reject it the BBC said. May’s office said it did not recognise the views expressed by the diplomat the BBC said. EU officials have long said that negotiating a trade deal with the bloc can take years pointing to the fact that Canada started talks in 2009 for an agreement that has yet to enter force. But British officials say they hope to reduce the amount of time to strike a deal arguing that British regulations are in line with EU standards after decades of membership. May has said she will invoke Article 50 the up to two-year divorce process for leaving the EU by the end of March. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

European Union leaders will meet on April 29 to collectively agree a Brexit negotiating position ahead of withdrawal talks with Britain European Council president Donald Tusk has announced. The timing of the summit will give leaders of the EU\\'s 27 other member states time to consider Mr Tusk\\'s response to UK Prime Minister Theresa May triggering Article 50 on March 29 which he has promised within 48 hours. The EU27 will then come together at the extraordinary summit in April to agree their position and give European Commission chief negotiator Michel Barnier a mandate for exit negotiations. The date of April 6 was initially pencilled in for a summit but after the Mrs May delayed triggering Article 50 to the end of the month despite receiving Parliament\\'s approval to do so on March 13. Mr Tusk announced the date of the summit on Twitter adding: \"Priority must be certainty clarity for all: citizens companies & member states.\" The timing of the summit means substantive negotiations will not begin until at least May giving the UK just 17 months to get a deal according to Mr Barnier\\'s timetable. The Frenchman has called for talks to be completed by October 2018 to give time for any agreement to be ratified before the UK leaves expected on March 29 2019 under the two-year Article 50 process. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The Prime Minister was speaking after leaders of the remaining 27 EU member states gave the green light for preparations to begin for the second phase of Brexit talks dealing with trade. The move paves the way for the possible start of formal talks on the future EU/UK trade relationship in December. The European Council in Brussels decided that insufficient progress had so far been made in divorce talks to move on to trade discussions now as Britain had hoped. Formal discussions with the UK will continue to focus on the \"divorce\" issues of citizens\\' rights the Irish border and Britain\\'s financial settlement. But Council president Donald Tusk said in a tweet: \"Brexit conclusions adopted. Leaders green-light internal EU27 preparations for 2nd phase.\" At a press conference after her participation in the summit concluded – and while the remaining 27 leaders continued their discussions – Ms May said: \"I am ambitious and positive for Britain\\'s future and for these negotiations. \"But I know we still have some way to go. Both sides have approached these talks with professionalism and a constructive spirit and we should recognise what has been achieved to date.\" The agreement among the 27 leaders to begin preparatory work on trade talks means scoping discussions are now expected to begin in Brussels in time for the next scheduled Council summit on December 14-15. Until then formal discussions with the UK will continue to focus on the \"divorce\" issues of citizens\\' rights the Irish border and Britain\\'s financial settlement.EU leaders made clear this morning that they are looking for more clarity from the UK about the size of its divorce bill before giving the go-ahead for trade talks to get under way. But Ms May repeatedly dodged attempts by reporters to get her to reveal the sum she was prepared to hand over to Brussels insisting that the financial settlement could only be finalised as part of the overall Brexit deal. She said officials were going through the issues \"line by line\" to decide what was owed and added: \"The full and final settlement will come as part of the final agreement that we are getting in relation to the future partnership and I think that\\'s absolutely right I think that can only be done in that particular context.\" Malta\\'s Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said Ms May\\'s address was a constructive one but no significant progress on Brexit was reported. Earlier German Chancellor Angela Merkel gave an upbeat assessment of the talks saying they were making progress \"step by step\". \"I have no doubt that if we are all in clear minds ... We are going to achieve a good outcome\" she said. \"As far as I am concerned I don\\'t hear any reason to believe that we are not going to be successful.\" Anti-Brexit protesters in London. Photo: Reuters Ms Merkel said she was \"highly motivated\" to work on a new mandate for chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier which might permit trade talks to begin in December but warned that the second stage of talks would be \"more complicated than the first\". On the divorce issues dealt with in the first stage there was \"by and large general agreement\" on the future status of the Irish border and \"headway\" was being made on expats\\' rights after Brexit but Mrs May made no specific new offer on Britain\\'s financial settlement she said. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the EU27 need \"more meat on the bone\" of Britain\\'s exit payment following Ms May\\'s promise in a speech in Florence last month that the UK would honour financial commitments made as an EU member.The offer made by Ms May in Italy is believed to amount to around €20 billion while Brussels is understood to be seeking something closer to €60 billion. Ms May said the two sides were within \"touching distance\" on a deal regarding citizens\\' rights. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier has said the UK can reverse its position on leaving the single market and customs union up until the end of the Brexit transition period. The EU official gave Theresa May until December 31 2020 to change her mind on Britain exiting the pair as it withdraws from the EU saying: \"So long as they have not left during the transition period everything is still possible.\" The Prime Minister used a speech in March to repeat her \"red lines\" that the UK will leave the single market and customs union as well as the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. The UK will formally leave the EU on March 29 2019 two years after the invocation of Article 50. The 21-month transition period is due to end on December 31 the following year coinciding with the end of the EU\\'s seven-year budget. Speaking to European reporters Mr Barnier said: \"If the British wish to modify their red lines we will modify ours in consequence. \"I am not hearing that today but everything is possible there is no dogmatism.\" He added: \"What creates the problem in Ireland is the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU but also to leave what it is not obligatory to leave that\\'s to say the single market and the customs union.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May will press EU leaders on Wednesday to back her proposal for a \"fair arrangement\" on future ties between Britain and the bloc call off \"unacceptable\" demands and show the goodwill needed to avoid a disorderly Brexit. Before a two-day European Union summit starts on Wednesday evening May showed no sign of backing away from her Brexit plan shrugging off criticism at home and in Brussels over her proposals for future trade relations the biggest policy shift for Britain in almost half a century. She may arrive in Austria feeling more optimistic after the EU\\'s negotiator Michel Barnier signalled he was ready to do more to address her concerns on Northern Ireland which will have the only UK land border with the bloc after Brexit day. But a British government source said London could not accept the province being separated off from the UK customs territory and Barnier\\'s comments only got a hostile reception from a small Northern Irish party on which May relies on in parliament. The summit opens in Salzburg with a leaders\\' dinner that has become a significant staging post in a carefully choreographed series of meetings with the EU before Britain leaves in March. With just over six months to go time is pressing and both sides are keen to secure some kind of deal before the end of the year and ease concerns over a disorderly exit which could plunge the economy into a downturn. Writing in Germany\\'s Die Welt May said the two sides were \"near to achieving the orderly withdrawal that is an essential basis for building a close future partnership\". \"To come to a successful conclusion just as the UK has evolved its position the EU will need to do the same. \"With goodwill and determination on both sides we can avoid a disorderly exit and find new ways of working together.\" At the dinner at the spectacular Felsenreitschule theatre -- known to film fans for a scene in the musical \\'The Sound of Music\\' -- May will make another pitch for support for her Chequers plan named after her country residence where a deal was hashed out with her ministers earlier this year. Then she will be out of the room on Thursday afternoon when the other 27 leaders discuss her Brexit proposals. EU officials said May could then meet Donald Tusk the summit chairman to be briefed on their talks. These are expected to end in an agreement on an extra summit in November to sign off on any deal that has been reached and a discussion of the scale of a declaration on future ties which Britain wants to be as detailed as possible. NORTHERN IRISH CONUNDRUM While both sides have been making positive noises there is no deal yet over what has become one of the biggest obstacles - how to keep an open border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. \"On Brexit it\\'s very difficult. We have nothing on Ireland\" Jean Asselborn Luxembourg\\'s foreign minister told Reuters. EU officials are minded not to paint May into a corner aware that she faces increasing opposition to her plans in her Conservative Party and elsewhere and needs a victory of sorts to persuade a reluctant parliament to back a deal. Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party which backs May\\'s minority government in Westminster criticised Barnier\\'s ideas for handling customs crossing the Irish frontier saying they would still mean an unacceptable border between the province and the rest of the United Kingdom. May has told lawmakers that they will vote either for a Chequers-based deal or to leave without an agreement. Mel Stride a junior treasury minister said pro-Brexit and pro-EU lawmakers could usher in a second referendum on EU membership if they reject her plan. For now against a frenzied political backdrop it only benefits both the EU and Britain to keep the mood positive. One EU official speaking on condition of anonymity said May\\'s team had asked Brussels and Barnier not to say that \"Chequers is dead\" and that the bloc would highlight progress by talking about future ties. \"So we won\\'t we have Barnier trying to import parts of it - on security and cooperation on international affairs - to the declaration on post-Brexit ties. This is how we are trying to help her\" the EU official said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May urged the European Union on Friday to show more flexibility in talks on a future relationship saying Britain was ready to swallow the \"hard facts\" of Brexit but did not believe they prevented a successful trade deal. In a much-anticipated speech May mixed a gentler tone jettisoning an earlier strident tone that Britain would walk away from the Brexit talks with an appeal to the EU to work together to solve some of the more difficult Brexit conundrums. She tried to tackle a row over EU member Ireland by again offering ways of avoiding a return to the hard border with the British province of Northern Ireland acknowledging that London would have to maintain regulatory standards with the bloc. That promise on regulation was one of several \"hard facts\" along with the suggestion that the European Court of Justice would still play a role after and that Britain might have to pay to get associate membership of EU institutions that could alarm vocal Brexit campaigners in her party. But it was she said time to be \"straight\" with people over what was achievable some 20 months after Britain voted to leave the EU and her government began to try to unravel more than 40 years of union. \"We all need to face up to some hard facts\" May told ambassadors and business leaders in the Mansion House the 18th century official home of the Lord Mayor of London in the heart of the capital\\'s financial district. \"Neither of us can have exactly what we want\" May said. \"So we need to strike a new balance. But we will not accept the rights of Canada and the obligations of Norway.\"  The speech entitled \"Our Future Partnership\" was an attempt to settle doubt over how Britain sees its future outside the EU and its economic architecture and to try to ease frustrations in Brussels over what they say is a lack of detail. She again dismissed the \\'off-the-shelf\\' trading arrangements which the EU already has with countries such as Norway saying that they did \"not provide the best way forward for either the UK or the EU\" she said. But her vision was little changed from an earlier proposal for Britain to be able to diverge from some of the EU\\'s rules and regulations while sticking to others which benefit Britain a plan the bloc has described as \"pure illusion\". \"So my message to our friends in Europe is clear. We know what we want. We understand your principles. We have a shared interest in getting this right. So let’s get on with it\" she said. The EU\\'s chief negotiator Michel Barnier welcomed her speech saying it offered clarity and a recognition of some of the trade-offs needed to agree a trade agreement. HARD TO PLEASE The 61-year-old leader has long kept her cards close to her chest trying to avoid provoking those who want a clean break with the EU or others who fear the world\\'s sixth-largest economy will suffer if barriers are raised against a major trading partner. A government source said the speech was aimed at showing more pragmatism in the Brexit talks which are now even struggling over the relatively easier part of agreeing a transition period after Britain leaves in March next year. One Brexit campaigner welcomed the speech and praised the prime minister who has been under pressure from two warring factions in her Conservative Party for putting the ball firmly in the EU\\'s court. \"The EU must now consider whether they want to put rigid doctrine ahead of the mutual interests of their people and those of the UK\" David Jones a Conservative lawmaker and former junior Brexit minister told Reuters. \"We must hope that they will be as positive and pragmatic as Theresa May.\" But any difficulties in her approach will be in the detail. After the EU set out in a draft withdrawal agreement a backup plan that effectively would see Northern Ireland remain part of the EU\\'s customs union she was under pressure to come up with a solution. But a government source said at least one of her proposals of having a customs partnership where Britain would implement EU tariffs on its border for goods intended for the EU or a streamlined customs arrangement where jointly implemented measures would minimise friction might need more work. And it is unclear whether Britain having access to the EU\\'s financial markets in return for having similar standards to those of the EU would be accepted in Brussels. Overall May appealed to the EU to work together. \"Yes there will be ups and downs in the months ahead. As in any negotiation no-one will get everything they want. We will not be buffeted by the demands to talk tough or threaten a walk out\" she said. \"By following the course I have set out today I am confident we will get there and deliver the right outcome for Britain and the EU.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Some other countries have also joined under varying conditions including Turkey and Norway but May has ruled this out for Britain. Members of a customs union apply the same tariff to imports from outside the union and apply no tariffs to goods from other members of the union. Economic supply chains across Europe rely heavily on this. For example car components criss-cross borders many times for processing before a vehicle is finally assembled. The union also limits checks and other time-consuming and costly bureaucracy at borders between members. Yet there are drawbacks to membership. One of the biggest is nations cannot strike their own free-trade deals in goods with other countries. May\\'s Brexit cabinet sub-committee meets on Wednesday to discuss the government\\'s position on a looser future customs arrangement with the EU. Why is the issue so divisive? The issue lies at the heart of the Brexit debate setting those who argue that pragmatism and business interests should shape government policy against those who prioritise sovereignty and the idea of Britain as a pioneering trading nation. The first group say staying in a customs union will smooth commerce with the world\\'s largest trading bloc. It will also avoid the return of a \"hard\" border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. There are fears that reintroducing checks on what will be Britain\\'s only land border with the EU could reignite sectarian violence. Brexit supporters say Britain must quit the customs union to pursue independent trade deals with other countries which they argue is a big advantage of leaving the EU. They say Britain cannot truly leave the EU without leaving the customs union. What has the government proposed so far? The government has proposed two ways of overcoming the difficulties of leaving the customs union and avoiding the need for border checks: a streamlined customs arrangement or a customs partnership. The first would involve using technology to lower customs barriers. Measures could include pre-approved \"authorised economic operators\" who are given faster clearance and pre-arrival notifications linked to customs declarations and vehicle registrations so trucks do not have to stop at borders. The second proposal would align Britain\\'s approach to customs with the EU\\'s removing the need for a customs border. Britain would continue to act as if it were in a customs union when dealing with imports from elsewhere. If they are bound for EU markets British authorities would collect the tariffs and pass them to the EU. What does the EU say? The EU has rejected both proposals. EU officials have dismissed a \"digital border\" as unrealistic. One EU diplomat told Reuters last month it is an \"elves and fairies\" solution. They have also said plans for a customs partnership are too complicated and are unlikely to work. The EU is already demanding Britain pay it 2.7 billion euros it has failed to collect due to fraud on Chinese imports. EU officials say that London has lost their trust on customs collection and its refusal to be bound by EU law after Brexit makes them unwilling to consider the proposal. Unless a better solution is found the EU has prepared an emergency mechanism under which it would go on regulating trade with Northern Ireland after Brexit. This is anathema to London and Northern Ireland unionists who see it as weakening the British province\\'s links to the rest of the United Kingdom. What is the Labour Party proposing? Labour has proposed Britain being in a new kind of permanent customs union with the EU. London would have a say in any future EU trade deals and be able to \"negotiate agreement of new trade deals in our national interest\". What role does Britain\\'s parliament have in this debate? The lower House of Commons is expected to vote soon on whether Britain should leave the customs union and there are concerns that the government may be defeated by pro-European rebels in May\\'s Conservative Party. So far 10 Conservative lawmakers have backed an amendment to proposed trade legislation that seeks to bind the government into being in a customs union with the EU. A similar amendment is also expected on a customs bill. Conservative and Labour sources say other lawmakers are willing to back the amendment but give no numbers. The votes could be tight: with the support of a Northern Irish unionist party May has a working majority of 13 seats although some pro-Brexit Labour lawmakers are expected to vote with the government. A second flashpoint is the EU withdrawal bill - the legislation that will formally end British membership. The upper House of Lords last month challenged the government\\'s plans to leave the customs union. When will the votes in parliament happen? Sometime in May the House of Commons will consider the amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill passed by the House of Lords. However the amendment requires ministers to report what efforts have been made to secure a customs union only by the end of October and does not explicitly say Britain must reach a deal on such a union. Some government officials say the vague wording means it is unlikely to change policy. Votes on the proposed trade and customs legislation will be more dangerous for the government but a timetable has yet to be made public. Some Conservative and Labour lawmakers say they could happen as soon as this month or delayed until the autumn. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The European Union issued Prime Minister Theresa May a final Brexit warning on Friday -- put your cards on the table offer ways to overcome \"huge\" differences and prevent Britain from crashing out of the bloc without a deal. On the second day of a summit more focused on migration than Brexit leaders of the other 27 EU countries were united in stepping up the pressure on May to overcome rifts in her government and move forward with all-but-stalled talks. May who left the summit after the first day has been reluctant to spell out detailed Brexit plans because of deep divisions in her Conservative Party over the terms of Britain\\'s biggest foreign policy shift in almost half a century. But she has promised to thrash out an agreement with her top team of ministers at a meeting next week and intends to present a policy document or white paper setting out the government\\'s aims for a future partnership after that. With only nine months to go before Britain leaves the EU it cannot come soon enough for summit chairman Donald Tusk and the bloc\\'s chief negotiator Michel Barnier. \"This is the last call to lay the cards on the table\" Tusk told reporters adding to growing calls for Britain to move quickly to try to secure a deal by October this year. Barnier repeated the warning that \"time is short\". \"Now we are waiting for the UK white paper and I hope it will contain workable and realistic proposals. But let me mention once again that the time is very short\" he said. The white paper will set out Britain\\'s vision for its future relationship with the EU something that has hobbled attempts to settle a divorce agreement especially over pledges on both side to prevent a return to a hard border on the island of Ireland. CARDS The lack of a proposal on how to keep a near-invisible border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland has stalled Brexit talks increasing frustration among the other leaders. \"It is clear that Europe will remain united on the Irish border question\" French President Emmanuel Macron told a news conference adding that London needed to be swift in delivering more clarity on the future relationship it wants with Europe. The summit\\'s conclusions underlined the leaders\\' concerns \"that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for Ireland/Northern Ireland\" but again held out the possibility of flexibility if \"the UK positions were to evolve\". After a marathon dinner to try to hammer out a deal on a crisis over migration Malta\\'s prime minister Joseph Muscat summed up the agreement on Brexit with a tweet: \"Almost 9 hours to approve MigrationEU conclusions not even 1 minute to approve Brexit conclusions. EU can still work together.\" Almost 9 hours to approve #MigrationEU conclusions not even 1 minute to approve #Brexit conclusions. #EU can still work together -JM #EUCO May again said on Friday she was \"ready to intensify and accelerate the pace of negotiations\" but only after warning EU leaders to consider Europe\\'s safety before cutting Britain adrift from its security architecture. Security is seen by British officials as one of the country\\'s strongest cards to play in the talks but another of May\\'s pledges - to leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice - has made continued cooperation more difficult. Asked whether she was bringing up security to try to deflect attention from a dearth of proposals on future trade she told reporters: \"No the future security partnership we have with the European Union will be very important.\" \"We currently enjoy a high level of cooperation with member states of the EU in a number of areas on security that are important for our citizens. This is what is at stake and I want to see a strong and deep security partnership continuing with our European Union partners.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s advisers have come up with a new proposal for handling customs with the EU after Brexit as lawmakers in her party bicker before a crunch meeting of senior ministers on Friday. With less than nine months left before the country leaves the European Union little is clear about how trade will flow as May is still trying to produce a customs plan that her divided Conservative Party can agree on. May who leads a minority government dependent on the support of a small Northern Irish party has ruled out staying in the EU customs union which groups EU members in a duty-free area where there is a common import tariff for non-EU goods. So far May\\'s advisers have come up with two options neither of which have the full support of her party. As EU negotiators await the long-delayed proposal from London the BBC reported that British officials have come up with a third model though no details were immediately available and May\\'s office declined to comment on the report. May will gather the squabbling ministers at her Chequers country residence on Friday for an \"away-day\" aimed at agreeing the contents of a \"white paper\" policy document. \"There is going to be a lot of speculation between now and Chequers some of it might even be true but I\\'m not going to engage in it in advance of the away day taking place\" May\\'s spokesman said when asked about the third option. Ahead of the away-day May will meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Thursday. Brussels has poured scorn on both concepts raised so far by the government. Under one Britain would collect tariffs on imports from outside the bloc on the EU\\'s behalf. The other would implement a technology-based plan. Asked whether the white paper would contain a range of policy options or a settled government position May\\'s spokesman said: \"I would expect it to set out what we want to achieve.\" CLIFF EDGE? Under the current timetable both London and Brussels are working towards a final Brexit deal in October to give enough time to ratify it by Brexit day in March 2019. In a sign of just how worried big business is getting Siemens Airbus and BMW have publicly cautioned Britain in the past month that their businesses will be hurt by a disorderly Brexit. A record 75 per cent of major British companies are now pessimistic about Brexit a survey showed on Monday highlighting weak investment and waning expectations for sales. When asked about business worries by ambassadors British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was reported by The Daily Telegraph newspaper to have quipped: \"F*** business\". A spokesman disputed that he had used bad language. May has so far shown some skill at keeping her dual negotiation with the EU and her lawmakers on track though the 30-year schism inside her party over Europe helped to sink the premierships of Margaret Thatcher John Major and David Cameron. More than 30 Conservative lawmakers have signed a letter demanding May \"get tough\" in negotiations. \"Our departure must be absolute\" the lawmakers said. \"We must not remain entangled with the EU\\'s institutions if this restricts our ability to exercise our sovereignty as an independent nation. Anything less will be a weakening of our democracy. Britain must stand firm.\" Lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg who heads a pro-Brexit faction pressed May on the type of Brexit she should seek setting out what kind of deals lawmakers would reject. \"Any attempt by the EU to impose its laws and Court on the UK either directly or indirectly must be rejected\" he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. The article drew a rebuke from Alan Duncan a Foreign Office minister who said he was being insolent. \"Lecturing and threatening the PM is just too much\" Duncan said on Twitter. \"Risks debasing govt party country & himself. PM must be given maximum latitude & backing.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Shutterstock  As Brexit day creeps closer one issue that remains unresolved is the way that food names will be protected in Britain and the EU. From parmesan and feta to cornish pasties and Bavarian beer the EU is fiercely protective over protected designations of origin (PDOs) or protected geographical indications (PGIs). A number of highly popular products are protected under this legal framework that dictates certain products can only be produced in certain regions. So champagne must be produced in the Champagne region of France and prosecco in a small pocket of north-eastern Italy. These are products with big market shares in the UK with consumer loyalty being built up and consolidated through the use of these reputable geographical names. The issue is also important to the UK. Many British products are also protected under the EU regime. It helps protect both their quality and value. But when the UK leaves the EU it will no longer be under the laws that govern the protective status of these products. The government’s recently launched white paper which outlined the UK’s plans for Brexit declares that Britain will set up its own protection of geographical names to provide for continuous protection of UK products within the UK. But it doesn’t mention any continuation of the EU’s protection scheme. Some in Brussels have expressed fear that British producers will start exploiting previously protected European names. Yet rather ironically British products would not lose their status in the EU (and could still seek new EU registrations in the future) since the EU allows for the protection of geographical names from non-EU countries. It’s an imbalance which seems to please British negotiators. So the European Commission fears that after Brexit the high level of protection that European products currently enjoy in the UK under EU law may evaporate. The white paper proposal rather contrasts with the commission’s proposal which suggests that the UK continue protecting geographical indications as it does under the EU. But the EU’s desire that post-Brexit Britain keep its protection of geographical indications is bound to collide with US strategic interests. The US position is an important factor to take into account in the Brexit negotiations. If the UK signs a trade deal with the US it will likely clash with a lot of EU regulations – including provisions governing the use of geographical names for food and beverages. The US plays by different rules when it comes to the protection of these names. There are numerous US food companies that freely use European geographical expressions (including parmesan and feta for cheese) to identify products that have not been produced in the relevant European locations. In the US these are considered to be generic names that describe the products and cannot be monopolised by anyone not even by the producers coming from the relevant European geographical area. That is why the US is lobbying the UK to abandon the EU’s protection of geographical indications namely to allow US food and beverage companies to enter the British market by freely using European names. A US-UK trade deal would likely be contingent on the UK dropping the EU-level protection of geographical indications. But this in turn would scupper the prospects of a trade deal with the EU – an even bigger trading partner for the UK. The EU has continuously placed great emphasis on the protection of its geographical names during trade negotiations. It proved to be a big sticking point in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations. France and Greece for example threatened to veto a deal with the US unless it upheld their geographical indications. More recently Italy’s minister for agriculture noted that Italy may not ratify the EU’s trade deal with Canada because in his view it does not adequately protect Italian geographical names. It is therefore not a stretch to say that the entire Brexit deal could hinge on the issue of geographical indications. There is no doubt that providing a level of protection in the UK which is comparable to the current EU scheme – for example via a mutual EU/UK recognition scheme – would facilitate an agreement not only on the specific issue of geographical names but also of the entire Brexit deal. This would however make favourable trade agreements between the UK and the US less likely. The battle over geographical indications will surely go on.

British Prime Minister Theresa May is due back in Brussels on Thursday on a last-gasp mission to beg EU leaders for more time to deliver a Brexit deal twice rejected by her own parliament. With just eight days until the UK\\'s four-decade-old European adventure comes to an abrupt end May\\'s frustrated European colleagues are losing faith in her ability to ratify an orderly withdrawal. But after she wrote to EU Council president Donald Tusk on Wednesday to ask for a three-month delay until June 30 he suggested the other 27 capitals might allow her more time to win over deeply sceptical British lawmakers. \\xa0\\xa0 Tusk admitted that European leaders are suffering \"Brexit fatigue\" and said he feared his hopes may prove \"frail even illusory\" -- but May nevertheless took to the airwaves to harangue MPs and to urge the British people to back her plan. \"You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with this. I agree. I am on your side\" May said blaming lawmakers for opposing her Brexit plan and insisting she was requesting a delay until June 30 with \"great personal regret\". Lawmakers have twice resoundingly rejected May\\'s agreement and a third vote the premier hoped to hold this week was cancelled by the House of Commons speaker on procedural grounds. Nevertheless Tusk was clear that Europe wants May to try again. \"In the light of the consultations I have conducted over the past days I believe a short extension will be possible but it will be conditional on a positive vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons\" he told reporters. On Thursday at an awkward EU Council summit May will have a chance to make the case outlined in her letter for a stay of Brexit execution -- although European diplomats stressed that no decision will be made until next week. The pound fell sharply against the euro during Wednesday -- exactly 1000 days on from Britain\\'s seismic 2016 referendum vote to split from the EU -- reflecting fears that Britain could crash out without any agreement at all. - \\'Credibility\\' -May said any postponement beyond the end of June would undermine voters\\' trust. \"It is high time we made a decision\" May said in her address. Meanwhile the European Commission advised EU leaders that it would be preferable to either have a shorter delay to May 23 -- when voting begins in European Parliament elections -- or a much longer one until at least the end of 2019. A spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed London\\'s \"clear request\" and said she would \"make every effort\" to bring about an agreement at the Brussels summit. But her foreign minister Heiko Maas of the junior coalition partner Social Democrats said May\\'s letter \"only pushes the solution further down the road\". And in Paris French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian had a tough message. \"A situation in which Mrs May is unable to deliver sufficient guarantees on the credibility of her strategy at the European Council meeting would lead to the request being refused and a preference for a no deal\" he told parliament. The British parliament has been deadlocked for months over Brexit with MPs unable to decide how to implement the referendum result and voters themselves are also sharply divided. But Britain is now in crisis facing the potentially catastrophic prospect of leaving its biggest trading partner after 46 years with no arrangements in place. - \\'Resignation threat? -In her letter May said she intended to bring her deal back to the Commons \"as soon as possible\" arguing that if it passed she would need the delay to implement the treaty. If the text is rejected a third time a deeply divided parliament will have to decide what happens next. \"As prime minister I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than June 30\" May told lawmakers in comments interpreted as a hint about her own future. May\\'s team tried to engage senior members of the opposition hoping to bring enough members on side to pull her deal through and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will also be in Brussels on Thursday for talks with EU negotiator Michel Barnier.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Briton Andrew Tristram has been left an \"orphan\" by Brexit but he\\'s found another welcoming home in Europe and will soon become a citizen in Denmark champion of a European Union a la carte. Before June 23 2016 the thought of obtaining Danish citizenship had never occurred to him. But after Britain\\'s referendum result in favour of Brexit the 47-year-old can\\'t wait to get his hands on his new European passport. \"I haven\\'t had a Danish passport before because it feels a bit like treason like I\\'m giving up on Britain. But they gave up on me\" Tristram says sitting in the foyer of the theatre in Herning western Denmark where he works in production. In November 1992 he moved to the europhile Scandinavian country after falling in love with a Danish woman he met in London. He has lived here since then while maintaining close ties with his native Wales. He now speaks Danish fluently. Like all Britons living outside the United Kingdom for more than 15 years he was not entitled to vote in the Brexit referendum. \"All these people decided what happens in my life and I don\\'t get a say\" he fumes. \\'Disappointed\\' by Brexit \"I thought it meant something to have a British passport.\" But \"when Brexit happened I lost something\" he says adding that he\\'s \"always been proud of being a British citizen\". Twenty-six years in Denmark has changed \"his outlook on life\" he reflects citing among other things the fact \"that I think that the European Union is a good thing\". Since joining the EU in 1973 Denmark has zealously guarded its sovereignty negotiating four key opt-outs from European cooperation: on security and defence citizenship police and justice and the adoption of the euro. As a result Denmark is considered the champion of a Europe a la carte. It is perhaps no surprise then that the population is among the most pro-EU in Europe with 75 percent of Danes considering the bloc a good thing compared to 61 percent of French and 39 percent of Czechs in a 2018 European Parliament survey. \"Angry\" and \"disappointed\" by the Brexit referendum Tristram who has two sons with his wife applied online in January 2018 to become a Danish citizen. First he had to pass a language proficiency test and a citizenship test designed to evaluate his knowledge of his adopted country. Highly criticised as difficult when it was introduced the test covers a range of subjects from the Vikings to the 1973 legislative election. Tristram passed with flying colours. \"Not because I\\'m bragging but we had a 25th anniversary party and one of the things we did is that we took the citizenship test. So I was surrounded by Danes and the person who had the most right answers was me.\" He completed the real test in just six of the 45 minutes allotted. \"You get a booklet and everything apart from the last five questions ... is in the booklet.\" Candidates need to correctly answer 32 of 40 questions to pass. Almost half of those who take the test fail. Slow process Andrew has been waiting for more than a year for his citizenship application to be processed. \"If I\\'m exceptionally lucky then I\\'ll be on the list (of people naturalised) in autumn this year\" he says. There\\'s no chance he\\'ll get his citizenship before Britain\\'s scheduled exit from the EU on March 29. \"I\\'m not expecting to be thrown out of Denmark but I can see that the summer holiday can very well be a problem.\" He and his family usually drive to Britain passing through a number of European countries on the way. \"If I\\'m going to have to apply for a visa to every single country it\\'s going to be an expensive holiday\" he moans. But the real problem is the uncertainty about what Brexit will entail. \"None of us knows what\\'s going to happen\" he says more fed up with the British political delays than the slow Danish naturalisation process. One thing is certain: he\\'s excited to get a Danish passport. He\\'ll retain British nationality as both countries allow dual citizenship. \"It makes you feel a bit like a secret agent. You open the drawer \\'Which passport am I going to use?\\'. That\\'ll be quite cool\" he smiles. A total of 383 Britons are among the 10108 foreigners who have obtained Danish nationality since 2017. More than a million Britons live outside Britain in the European Union including 15000 in Denmark. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Malta will be losing its strongest tax harmonisation ally when Britain leaves the EU stakeholders were warned on Wednesday. “The biggest risk for Malta as a whole and for Maltese businesses will come after Brexit when the island sits at the EU negotiation table without Britain” Marisa Xuereb managing director of Raesch Quarz Ltd told a panel discussion themed ‘Is risk still risky if you can see it coming?’ Brexit\\xa0is just\\xa0156 days away. Speaking at the EY Malta’s Annual Attractiveness Event she said businesses had not yet sensitised themselves enough to the issue of tax policy – an important issue when it comes to Malta’s attractiveness as a business location. “Without Britain in the EU tax harmonization becomes a very different ball game for us. Britain was the leader of the anti-tax harmonization movement – without Britain we will lose a very strong ally and we are left very much alone with Cyprus.” Reacting Parliamentary Secretary for EU Funds Aaron Farrugia noted that Malta needed to caucus with other countries facing the same challenges when it comes to the fiscal regime now that the \"big brother was leaving\". \"I think that no matter what we should maintain a special relationship with the UK while pushing for co-location. Companies will not leave the UK and base themselves in Malta however they can co-locate and so far Malta has attracted some Indian businessmen and insurance companies among others.\" Mr Farrugia\\xa0said he believes that a Brexit deal will be reached by March however the headache remains the EU budget post-2020 considering that Britain is the second largest contributor. All member states will have to do more with less and be more efficient with the budget while some such as Sweden Denmark and Austria are pushing for a smaller budget he added. According to the latest Ernst & Young Attractiveness Survey Brexit\\xa0is a concern for 19% foreign-direct investors base in Malta – down 1% over 2017. Despite this 77% said the UK’s decision to leave the EU had no impact on their business operations in Malta to date. Ms Xuereb noted that until the parameters of Brexit were defined businesses had no risk to quantify – \"we have just uncertainty and uncertainty is not risk\". “There are a few of us\\xa0 - manufacturing businesses that have a substantial market in the UK - are clearly exposed however they are being supported by the Malta Enterprise (ME).” Addressing the same panel ME chair William Wait meanwhile noted that unlike foreign direct investors Britain seemed to be in panic mode. ME was mainly focused on the manufacturing sector and not all Maltese manufacturers were operating and trading with Britain. So although it did have general schemes and support systems it worked mainly with individual companies on a one-on-one basis because each company had its specific challenges. At the moment it was very difficult to come up with some kind of support or plan for individual companies as even they were unsure of whether or how Brexit will affect them he said. However he added that Malta had the opportunity to encourage companies in the UK to open a branch here so that when Brexit kicks off they would still have a foot in the EU. Speaking from the floor British High Commissioner to Malta Stuart Gill refuted the notion that Britain was in panic mode. “We are where we thought we would be at the beginning of the process…. we are at the pointy end of negotiations and it was never going to be straightforward.” Commissioner Gill said Britain was very close to a deal with the remaining key issue being Ireland\\'s border. Britain will leave the EU but it will have as close a relationship with the EU as it can possibly get he added. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The UK’s withdrawal from the European Union has been a difficult process to navigate from the start. With time running out to secure a Brexit deal the British immigration minister Caroline Nokes caused confusion in early November when she appeared not to know the UK government’s plans for EU citizens in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Nokes was asked by Yvette Cooper chair of the home affairs select committee how employers were to distinguish between EU citizens who had just arrived and EU citizens who had been in the UK for years in the event of a no-deal. Nokes replied that there was an expectation on employers to carry out right-to-work checks rigorously. Yet this would allow employers to determine who was an EU citizen and also therefore discriminate against them more easily. Nokes’s answer directly contradicted statements issued by the Home Office to EU citizens’ rights campaign groups which guaranteed that such checks would not be necessary. The confusion caused panic among EU citizens living in the UK. Sajid Javid the home secretary had to quickly issue a statement reassuring EU citizens that what Nokes said was in fact wrong. Instead there would be a “transition period” before the right-to-work checks were required. Yet it’s not clear whether this is the same transition period due to end in December 2020 that the EU and UK set out as part of the Brexit negotiations. So what do we really know about what a no-deal Brexit would mean for EU citizens? In March 2018 the EU and UK jointly published a draft withdrawal agreement. The section on citizens’ rights which was entirely agreed by both sides suggested that a number of residency rights for EU citizens and their families whether EU citizens or not would be protected and continue in the same way as they currently exist under EU law. This reciprocally covers EU citizens living in the UK and British citizens in the EU. However a joint report on the progress of negotiations published in December 2017 had included a key caveat: “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed”. This means that if no deal is reached between the EU and UK the draft withdrawal agreement would not apply and anything previously agreed in it would not be binding. In this case both EU citizens in the UK and British citizens in the EU would be left in a precarious position. In fact a draft law currently going through the French parliament would potentially allow visas to be imposed on British citizens visiting France if the UK exits without a deal. In July 2018 the Home Office published its guidance on a new EU citizen settlement scheme which all EU citizens in the UK will need to apply for to secure their right to stay in the UK after Brexit. It was advertised as a straightforward online process with three “simple” steps that applicants must satisfy in order to qualify. In September 2018 the pilot scheme was rolled out and an initial report on the first stage of testing declared it a success. However this was contradicted by the fact that the Home Office itself admitted that the app created to manage the settlement applications will not work on Apple phones. The system doesn’t rely on there being a deal reached so it is possible that in the event of a no-deal the UK government may still decide to continue with it. Still there are outstanding issues with the EU settlement scheme separate from those posed by a no-deal scenario and some have expressed concern that it will be difficult for vulnerable EU citizens to apply. In September the Prime Minister Theresa May guaranteed that the rights of EU citizens in the UK will be protected in the event of a no-deal scenario. But will the EU settlement scheme be abandoned in such a scenario? If so then those who are not able to claim permanent residency by living in the UK for five years consecutively before March 29 2019 could potentially find themselves at risk of deportation. This raises a whole host of human rights issues mostly related to interferences to private and family life. The biggest remaining question is when exactly free movement of EU citizens to the UK will end if no specific Brexit deal is reached. Under the terms of the transition period agreed with the EU it would end after December 2020 meaning any EU citizen arriving to live in the UK until then would be guaranteed the right to stay. But when asked in parliament on November 5 what would happen in the event of a no-deal the government was unable to answer whether free movement would immediately cease on March 30 2019. Though this important question has been asked many times since no-deal became more likely the closer March 29 2019 draws the more urgently an answer is needed. Deal or no-deal the UK government needs to clarify its position on EU citizens’ rights after Brexit as mistakes like those made by Nokes do nothing to reassure those affected who need to make decisions about their futures.

The British parliament\\'s crushing rejection of the Brexit withdrawal deal will not force Europe to renegotiate its terms but will almost certainly delay the divorce. And if Brussels gives London a few months\\' grace it would be to allow Britain to change course and seek closer future ties than Prime Minister Theresa May has so far been ready to accept. Some in London think May should try to win new concessions or assurances that would allow her to revive a deal that MPs rejected by 432 votes to 202. Read: \\'Humiliated\\': British press says May \\'crushed\\' by defeat But EU officials insist there\\'s no room to renegotiate a withdrawal deal hammered out over 18 months of painstaking diplomacy and experts warn against allowing May false hope. Nevertheless the withdrawal agreement came with a political declaration that laid out a road-map to future UK-EU ties and this could be modified if May drops her red lines. Britain could then seek a Norway-style association with the EU remaining a member of a customs union or even the single market in return for accepting some conditions of membership. Peter Kellner visiting scholar at Carnegie Brussels and former head of polling firm YouGov told AFP that EU negotiators should adopt \"tough love tactics\" with Britain. \"The issue next week or the one after will be what happens when it becomes clear that Theresa May cannot get anything like what she wants through parliament\" he said. Read: Would a Norway option break the Brexit stalemate? \\'Radical change\\' \"One of two things will happen: Either she will change her position radically or if she doesn\\'t parliament will take control and parliament will impose a radical change. \"The danger of the EU trying to see if there\\'s a way of trying to get Theresa May out of her hole is that we have another three or four months of discussions that don\\'t get anywhere.\" So far EU leaders seem to be heeding such warnings. Donald Tusk the president of the European Council made it clear that he would like to see Britain rethinking leaving the bloc. \"If a deal is impossible and no one wants \\'no deal\\' then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?\" the former Polish premier tweeted. Without a withdrawal agreement Britain leaves the European Union in under 1750 hours at midnight on March 29. Everyone in Brussels assumes the deadline will now be extended but not beyond the end of June when a new European parliament will take its seats -- presumably without British MEPs. If London leaves without a deal most experts predict disastrous economic disruption and some fear the return of a hard border in Ireland that could undermine the peace process there. Frustrated European leaders are cautious of intervening in May\\'s domestic agony but some say the best thing they can do is to stand firm and wait for May to come to them. \"They have to be blunt\" said Andrew Duff a former British MEP and a scholar with the European Policy Centre. \"They aren\\'t going to agree to reopen the withdrawal agreement but they are certainly prepared indeed pleased to open up the political declaration. The Brits have to ask them\" he said. \"But if you open it up there\\'s the opportunity to modify those red lines in a pro-integrationist direction\" he told AFP. If May can convince her own cabinet - perhaps after losing some more of her more eurosceptic ministers - she may be able to get parliament on board with a softer Brexit. Hardline Brexiteers would see this as a betrayal but May may have no choice but to seek opposition support if she wants an agreement. Read: How Europe reacted to Brexit deal defeat \\'Blackmail\\' Nevertheless the scale of May\\'s task has left some wondering if Brexit could be reversed by a second vote. \"We start to sense that the game is getting very tight\" Elvire Fabry a scholar at the Delors Institute told AFP. \"There is no majority for anything in the British parliament and the choices narrow down to a \\'no deal\\' and of a second referendum given that Europe has reached out its hand.\" Others however fear another referendum would extend the uncertainty and never produce a clear result. And it may be time for Europe to blink and agree to a time limit - albeit a lengthy one - on the \"back stop\" clause in the divorce deal designed to keep the Irish border open. \"If you\\'re faced with a choice between an immediate border and a deal with a time limited backstop of say 15 years I\\'m not sure what you choose\" said Guntram Wolff of the Bruegel think tank. \"Of course you don\\'t want to give in to blackmail but on the other hand the defeat is so big do you really want to have a border as of 30 March?\" Read:\\xa0Post-Brexit vote: be wary of prospects of a new \\'consensus\\' approach \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Prime Minister Theresa May said Monday she would seek further talks with Brussels to salvage her Brexit deal but offered no new solutions to break the deadlock just 10 weeks before Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union. MPs in the House of Commons last week roundly rejected the divorce terms May has struck with the bloc raising the risk that Britain crashes out with no deal on March 29. She responded by opening talks with rival political parties but in a statement to the Commons on Monday failed to suggest a radically different approach. May offered guarantees to the opposition Labour party on workers\\' rights and promised greater input for lawmakers over future trade talks with the EU. But she said her focus would be on addressing concerns among her own Conservative MPs and Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) over the controversial Irish border \"backstop\" plan in the current deal. \"I will be talking further this week to colleagues - including in the DUP... I will then take the conclusions of those discussion back to the EU\" she told MPs. She also said she looked forward to exploring in more detail a proposal by Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz to put a five-year time limit on the backstop. But opposition parties accused her of refusing to accept that MPs had rejected her deal and expressed doubt she could get the changes she needed to win them over. \"The prime minister seems to be going through the motions of accepting the result but in reality is in deep denial\" said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Carolyn Fairbairn from the CBI business lobby group expressed dismay that May had not offered a clearer way forward. \"The fundamentals have not changed. Parliament remains in deadlock while the slope to a cliff edge steepens\" she wrote on Twitter. EU leaders have warned May she should not expect any fundamental changes to the withdrawal deal the product of almost two years\\' work. They have repeatedly refused demands by Brexit supporters to remove or limit the \"backstop\" arrangement. This is a legal guarantee that the border with Ireland would remain free-flowing if and until Britain and the EU agree new trade terms. Many MPs reject it because it could see Britain tied to EU trade rules for years to come and create a separate status for the British province of Northern Ireland. Czaputowicz broke ranks to suggest a five-year limit to the backstop could be a way to \"unblock negotiations\". \"It would obviously be less favourable for Ireland than an indefinite backstop but much more advantageous than no-deal Brexit\" he told the Rzeczpospolita newspaper. The idea was immediately rejected by Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney. \"Putting a time limit on an insurance mechanism which is what the backstop is effectively means that it\\'s not a backstop at all\" he said. In the run-up to last week\\'s vote on the Brexit deal May secured assurances from EU leaders that the backstop would only ever be temporary. But they were not enough to convince the DUP which props up her government in parliament or the 118 Conservative MPs who rebelled to reject the agreement. The talks with other parties will continue this week until MPs vote on January 29 on a range of possible next steps -- when there could be fireworks. Several groups of lawmakers are planning to table amendments to try to force May to stop Britain leaving the EU without a deal or delay the process. In her statement on Monday May noted the British people had already voted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum by 52 percent to 48 percent and this should be respected. Corbyn has refused to meet with May until she rules out \"no deal\" but she said the only way to do this was to agree a deal or stop Brexit altogether. She sought to woo individual Labour MPs by promising a guarantee to protect workers\\' rights and the environment. May also announced she would waive the fee that had been planned for millions of European Union citizens living in Britain to apply for permanent status after Brexit. The £65 fee - similar to that paid by British citizens for a passport - had drawn criticism from a number of lawmakers. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

As I suggested might happen in a previous article MPs in the UK have put down amendments to the government’s finance bill to influence Brexit policy. Amendment 7 proposed by Labour MP Yvette Cooper with Nicky Morgan Hilary Benn and Oliver Letwin limits the government’s powers to adjust the law about indirect taxation (for example VAT and excise duties) after Brexit unless parliament has either agreed to a deal or voted explicitly to accept a no-deal arrangement. MPs voted 303 to 296 to pass the amendment.\\xa0The amendments do not shut down any UK government services but they do undermine the government’s ability to pay for its spending out of taxation More dramatically New Clause 25 proposed by the Liberal Democrats with the support of the SNP Plaid Cymru and the Green Party uses the mechanism of limiting the government’s power to levy income tax and corporation tax (about 38% of government revenue) a power that needs to be renewed every year to force the government to rule out a no-deal Brexit by default. Currently if parliament votes down the government’s Brexit deal a no-deal Brexit happens automatically. Theresa May is threatening MPs that if they refuse to pass her deal she will sit on her hands and allow no deal to happen. New Clause 25 changes the situation by linking the government’s own fate to the default option and putting all the other possible solutions to the Brexit problem currently being excluded by the government onto the agenda. The government has authority to charge income tax and corporation tax only until the end of the tax year (April 5). When the House of Commons gave the finance bill a second reading on November 12 2018 under section 1 of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 the government gained additional temporary authority to charge the two taxes based on the budget resolutions of October 31 2018 until the end of May 2019. Section 1(5) of the 1968 Act however removes that temporary authority if during the passage of the bill the House rejects the provisions giving effect to it.\\xa0\\xa0Clause 25 changes the situation by linking the government’s own fate to the default option and putting all the other possible solutions to the Brexit problem currently being excluded by the government onto the agenda New Clause 25 works by eliminating the renewal of the government’s authority to charge income tax and corporation tax unless at least one of five things happens: the deal is passed a referendum is called on revoking the Article 50 notice the Article 50 notice is revoked without a referendum the government asks for an extension to the Article 50 process or the House of Commons passes a motion approving a no-deal exit. If New Clause 25 were to be selected for debate by the Speaker and passed by the House the government would have a limited range of options. It could still propose its deal but if the deal loses the government would need openly to adopt a new policy. It could try to persuade parliament to approve a no-deal exit but all the indications are that MPs would reject no deal. At that point to retain its authority to levy direct taxes it would need rapidly to shift to holding a new referendum or asking for an extension to the Article 50 process (in all probability those options would go together) or revoking the Article 50 notice without a referendum. The government might also try the extension option by itself seeking an extension merely to implement a no-deal exit. However even that option needs parliamentary endorsement since the parallel domestic legal change altering the date of exit away from March 29 2019 cannot be done without an affirmative resolution of the House. Could the government simply ignore the vote? In theory it could propose another budget although that might fall foul of the rule that the House may not decide the same question twice in a session. It could try asking the Queen to end the parliamentary session. That though would itself end the government’s temporary authority to levy taxes. Even in a new session the government would find it difficult to get its budget resolutions passed before March 29. It might have a better chance of getting a second budget through after the UK leaves the EU but it would have only a few days to do that given that ending the parliamentary session early would have terminated the extension of temporary authority to the end of May. Cooper’s amendment has a smaller effect concerning only adjustments to the relevant taxes rather than authority to collect them at all but the mechanism is the same. It can be complied with only by passing the deal or letting the House of Commons vote for no deal or the government asking for an extension. The idea is that since the referendum option cannot in practice be achieved without asking for an extension and the immediate revocation option would end any need for the clause itself those options are covered by implication. The media reports about these amendments have said that they parallel events in the US in particular the federal government shutdown. This is not accurate. The US situation arises out of a refusal to pass authorisations to spend. The equivalent UK bills were passed in March 2018 and bills authorising spending in the next financial year have not yet been proposed. The UK situation concerns not authority to spend but authority to tax. The amendments do not shut down any UK government services but they do undermine the government’s ability to pay for its spending out of taxation.

Alternative markets for the purchase of most of the 1870 medicinal products bought from the UK were identified in case of a no-deal Brexit Health Minister Chris Fearne said on Wednesday. Mr Fearne told Parliament an alternative market for about 80 of the products in question had yet to be found adding that the government was working closely with the European Medicines Authority to address the situation. The government had also started stockpiling certain medicine to avoid problems in case of certain “hiccups”.\\xa0 The Medicines Authority had also held talks with importers to ensure there were no shortages or price increases. The 1975 agreement enabling Maltese citizens to receive treatment in the UK for free would remain in force the minister said.\\xa0 The Medical Council would also introduce a fast-track system to facilitate the registration of professionals who came to Malta to treat patients together with their teams. Mr Fearne also confirmed that existing agreements with schools across the UK would not be impacted by a no-deal scenario and doctors from the two countries could still work in hospitals in both countries. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Barnier was speaking after talks with Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz who also saw a \\xa0problem with the European elections. \"The participation of a country that wishes to leave the European Union in European elections would be more than absurd\" Kurz said. \"So our goal has to be that the exit if it has to happen happens in an orderly fashion\" he added. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Senior Maltese diplomats at the Foreign Office are fuming over a government decision to send a Labour activist instead of a seasoned diplomat to the European Commission’s Brexit team . The Times of Malta is informed that Randolph Debattista until the last elections working in the communications office of the Labour Party has been seconded by the government to the European Commission’s Brexit team. A spokesman for chief negotiator Michel Barnier confirmed that Mr Debattista was chosen by the Maltese government to act as Malta’s presidency representative on the team helping out the former EU commissioner. Mr Barnier has been entrusted by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to act as the EU executive’s chief negotiator with the British government on the terms of the UK’s exit from the EU. The government’s decision to send Mr Debattista to the Brexit team irked senior Maltese diplomats both in Malta and in Brussels who said that this decision continues to show the Prime Minister’s total disregard for the experience of Malta’s diplomats and the Foreign Ministry as a whole. “Instead of taking the opportunity to send to Mr Barnier’s team one of Malta’s most seasoned diplomats who can help out with wide experience on this dossier the Prime Minister chose a political appointee with no experience whatsoever in diplomatic circles” a senior diplomat who used to serve as an ambassador told the Times of Malta. “For the OPM the Brexit post seems to be an opportunity for another promotion for a blue-eyed boy and not an opportunity for the country to show its mettle” another diplomat said. Mr Debattista was catapulted to a Brussels post as a government person of trust and assigned to manage the office of Malta’s permanent representative to the EU Marlene Bonnici. In Brussels he joined his boyfriend Cyrus Engerer who after being found guilty of a criminal offence relating to pornography dropped his candidacy as an MEP hopeful on the Labour ticket. Instead the Prime Minister sent Mr Engerer and Mr Debattista to Malta’s permanent representation in Brussels with salaries of over €80000 a year each. Mr Barnier’s spokesman made it clear that Mr Debattista was the Maltese government’s choice and his secondment would only last until the end of Malta’s presidency of the European Council. Asked to confirm Mr Debattista’s secondment and how he had been appointed a spokesman for the Prime Minister said the appointment was “based on his qualifications and experience”. This newspaper has already reported the strained relations between the Foreign Affairs Ministry headed by senior minister George Vella and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister which is also directly responsible for European Affairs. In what seemed to be an internal government rift diplomats at the Foreign Office and in embassies around the globe were ordered to stop using the logo of Malta’s presidency of the EU in their correspondence. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Two big Irish energy projects designed to reduce dependence on Britain are set to benefit from EU funding as the bloc steps up efforts to support the country with the most to lose when its bigger neighbour quits the European Union. Brexit has cast doubt over the security of the gas Ireland imports from Britain which supplies 60 percent of its needs. As an EU member Ireland is not allowed to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement. The Irish government has thrown its weight behind two new energy import projects: EirGrid and RTE\\'s Ireland-France electricity link and a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal proposed by a private investment vehicle that took over the project from U.S. energy giant Hess. \"Because all of our electricity and gas interconnections are with Britain it would be irresponsible of us not to explore all other options\" Ireland\\'s Energy Minister Denis Naughten told Reuters. \"We will be available and will assist\" he said adding that the projects may seek funding from Ireland\\'s state strategic investment fund. The European Investment Bank (EIB) which invested some 800 million euros in Ireland last year said it would be interested in lending money to support the Ireland-France electricity link also known as the Celtic Interconnector. The EIB has previously provided loans to European LNG import projects. \"The EIB is very conscious that Ireland is uniquely exposed to the economic consequences of Brexit\" EIB Vice President Andrew McDowell told Reuters. \"The need to show tangible European support for Ireland is becoming more pressing and the EIB is part of that.\" The two Irish energy import projects are each expected to cost around 1 billion euros each to build so securing additional funding sources would provide a huge boost. EirGrid said it was focusing on evaluating the cost of the Celtic Interconnector and would concentrate on funding arrangements later. A spokesman for the Shannon LNG project said the company was evaluating its funding options. The Celtic Interconnector set to run from the southern Irish coast to Brittany in France from 2025 last month received a 4 million euro funding boost from the EU showing Ireland\\'s energy security is also at the top of the European Commission\\'s agenda. The Shannon LNG project will be able to pump a maximum of 28.3 million cubic metres of gas per day into the Irish grid equivalent to more than twice Ireland\\'s annual gas demand. It will be the closest European port of call for a glut of U.S. LNG exports set to start flowing in coming years. The developer is also proposing to build Ireland\\'s first gas storage tanks and a 500-megawatt power plant at the site. But plans for the LNG terminal shortlisted for EU funding have lain idle in recent years because global LNG oversupply and Irish regulations on costs for connecting the facility to the network have hampered the project\\'s economics. IRELAND\\'S \\'PIVOTAL ROLE\\' Ireland\\'s energy dependence on Britain puts it in a sticky position at Brexit talks: On one hand a deal that lets Britain maintain its trade ties would mean less interruption to Ireland\\'s energy supplies; on the other Dublin needs to align itself with its EU allies who can afford a much tougher stance. \"Ireland will play a pivotal role in these negotiations because of Northern Ireland\" said Silke Goldberg partner specialising in energy law at Herbert Smith Freehills. Experts are concerned Brexit could jeopardise plans to join the Irish and Northern Irish electricity markets by the end of this year a multi-year project to create a unified Irish electricity market in line with EU legislation. \"Our first concern is that we don\\'t revert back to a divided Ireland on energy\" said Eamon Ryan Irish energy minister between 2007 and 2011 and now leader of Ireland\\'s Green Party.\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06   \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The carrier said the accreditation process is \"well advanced\" and it hopes to receive the AOC \"in the near future\". It will allow the company to continue to operate flights across Europe and domestically within Europe after the UK withdraws from the EU. EasyJet which currently has airlines based in the UK and Switzerland will establish a third EasyJet which currently has airlines based in the UK and Switzerland will establish a third easyJet Europe headquartered in Vienna. A spokeswoman said \"nothing will change\" from the perspective of passengers and all the people and planes that will fly for easyJet Europe are already employed and based in the remaining 27 EU countries. EasyJet previously insisted it would not reveal the location of its new £10 million AOC until the application was granted but it made the announcement after it became clear the information would emerge as it has to update its safety systems and processes as part of the approval process. In March the Times of Malta reported media claims that\\xa0easyJet may seek an operating licence in Malta to be able to fly freely across the European Union after the UK left the bloc. It chose Austria because of the country\\'s \"rigorous approach to safety\" and ability to take on a large number of aircraft. The single market for aviation created in the 1990s means there are no commercial restrictions for airlines flying within the EU. UK ministers say maintaining \"liberal access\" to European aviation markets will be a \"top priority\" during Brexit negotiations. Under the new structure the three easyJet airlines will be owned by easyJet plc which will be EU-owned and controlled listed on the London Stock Exchange and based in the UK. But the change will not protect the company if an agreement cannot be reached to enable flights between the UK and the EU to continue. An easyJet spokeswoman said: \"Given the importance of aviation to all the economies of Europe as an enabler of trade tourism and travel we think it is important that the aviation market remains as open and competitive as possible. \"EasyJet will continue to push for the EU and UK to reach an aviation agreement which at a minimum will enable flights between the UK and EU.\" Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s spokeswoman told a Westminster briefing the matter is a \"commercial decision\" for the airline. She said: \"In any deal that we want to strike with the EU we want to make sure that it\\'s a good deal for everyone including businesses that operate here.\" The establishment of easyJet Europe will create a number of new jobs in Austria but no jobs will move from the UK. Current rules state that airlines operating within the EU must be majority-owned by EU nationals. EasyJet said it is confident it will remain majority EU-owned after Brexit as founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou and his family - who hold Cypriot passports - have 33% of shares. Around 30% of easyJet passengers are flying on routes between and within the EU27 not touching the UK. Aviation consultant John Strickland said: \"With the conclusion of the AOC process in Austria easyJet will secure its rights to operate intra-EU flights in a post-Brexit world. \"These are a strategically important and sizeable component of their business.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

The Council he said had always followed the recommendations made by the EU\\'s chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Malta agreed with this stance. It was now up to the UK to say precisely what it wanted Dr Muscat said noting that Mrs May had been relatively vague in her much-quoted Florence speech last September.\\xa0 Dr Muscat and Mrs May held a brief meeting on the fringes of the EU Council meeting on Thursday.\\xa0 OPINION: A union of equals A security cooperation agreement between the EU\\xa0and UK would most likely pose relatively few challenges to reach he said with both sides keen to ensure they continued to protect each other.\\xa0 A free trade agreement on the other hand will be a tougher nut to crack. Dr Muscat said he expected the UK to now define what it expected in this sphere.\\xa0 Defence cooperation Dr Muscat also touched upon Malta\\'s decision to opt out of the EU\\'s\\xa0new defence agreement saying his government was steering clear to avoid any potential conflicts with Malta\\'s constitutional neutrality clause.\\xa0 He said that while there most likely would be no conflict between the two it remained unclear whether the PESCO\\xa0agreement would function simply as a means of better coordinating the sale and purchase of armaments or whether it would assume a more military hue.\\xa0 Malta he noted could always invoke a solidarity clause within the EU\\xa0treaty to seek military help from other member states should the need arise.\\xa0 Migration The Maltese Prime Minister also spoke about migration saying that while Malta had fulfilled 100 per cent of its migrant quota pledge other countries could not say the same thing.\\xa0 He acknowledged that it was always going to be difficult to convince member states to take in a fixed number of migrants and said that member states would be having a long hard talk about the issue at an EU\\xa0Council meeting next June.\\xa0 EU gives green light for next phase of Brexit talks The European Union agreed on Friday to move talks forward with London on Britain\\'s exit from the bloc as leaders warmed to the British premier. On the second day of a summit in Brussels leaders said that \"sufficient progress\" was made after a deal on citizens\\' rights the Irish border and Britain\\'s outstanding payments giving negotiators a mandate to move onto the main phase of talks. \"EU leaders agree to move on to the second phase of Brexit talks.

Photo: Reuters  Prime Minister Theresa May needs to speed up negotiations with the European Union business leaders told her yesterday amid concern Britain will crash out the world’s biggest trading bloc without a deal. Slow progress in the talks with the European Union has unsettled businesses and drawn warnings that unless a transition is agreed soon some may begin activating Brexit contingency plans – which may include moving out of Britain. May had invited 15 business groups from Britain and continental Europe for talks in her Downing Street office to urge them to back her Brexit strategy and persuade companies not to move overseas. The executives told May she needed to provide more clarity on three issues critical for talks to progress: negotiating any potential exit bill settling the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and arrangements for the border in Ireland. “Business is extremely concerned with the slow pace of negotiations and the lack of progress” said Emma Marcegaglia president of BusinessEurope a lobby group that speaks for companies in European countries including Britain. May wants to agree with the EU the broad outline of a so-called implementation period of around two years after Britain’s exit from the EU in March 2019. During that period its access to the EU single market would remain largely unchanged while new arrangements were put in place. International companies have become increasingly vocal in recent weeks over fears that Britain will leave the EU without a trade deal a move that would send shockwaves through global markets and fracture some supply chains. Carolyn Fairbairn director general of the Confederation of British Industry said all the businesses at the meeting warned May about the damage leaving without a trade deal could do. “We now need to move beyond warm words if jobs investment and living standards are to be protected” she said. Talks between Britain and the EU are currently deadlocked. The European Union told Britain last week to spell out what it will pay Brussels when it leaves the bloc in 2019 or face more delay in talks on future trade ties that are vital for business. Progress at a Brussels summit next month is seen as an important milestone in the talks as businesses seek clarity by the new year when many will take investment decisions dependent on conditions after Brexit. May has stepped up her engagement with businesses in recent months regularly meeting with British lobby groups and senior executives but they say the government has offered little detail about what a future trade deal will actually look like. Yesterday’s meeting was the first time she expanded that programme to include representatives from industry groups from Germany France Italy Spain and other member States as well as EU-wide organisations. They also met business minister Greg Clark Brexit minister David Davis and the junior Treasury minister Stephen Barclay. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Business leaders are calling for a Brexit transition deal to be agreed \"as soon as possible\" as firms are preparing to make \"serious decisions\" with consequences for jobs and investment early next year. In a draft letter intended for Brexit Secretary David Davis five of Britain\\'s biggest business lobby groups also called for the transition period to match as closely as possible current trading arrangements with the European Union. Theresa May who will today make a House of Commons statement on last week\\'s European Council summit has requested a time-limited transition of around two years with the UK and EU trading on broadly similar terms to now and payments to Brussels to fulfil already agreed budget commitments. But although EU leaders agreed at the summit to begin scoping work on a future relationship they made clear to the Prime Minister she must make more concessions on a divorce payment to unlock talks on trade and a transition. The private letter which is believed not to have been sent yet was reportedly signed by the CBI British Chambers of Commerce manufacturing trade body EEF the Institute of Directors and the Federation of Small Businesses. The letter originally obtained by Sky News said: \"Agreement (on a transition) is needed as soon as possible as companies are preparing to make serious decisions at the start of 2018 which will have consequences for jobs and investment in the UK. Business groups are understandably alarmed by the government\\'s lack of progress in the talks. \"And the details of any transitional arrangement matter: the economic relationship the UK and EU has during this time-limited period must match as close as possible the status quo.\" The letter added: \"It is vital that companies only have to undertake one adjustment as a result of the UK\\'s withdrawal not two - and that businesses the UK government and authorities in the EU have enough time to make the changes needed to deliver Brexit successfully.\" The letter appeared amid reports that the government may use the coming weeks to step up preparations for no deal in an attempt to force the EU\\'s hand in negotiations by showing the UK is ready to leave without an agreement in the hope that it could kickstart trade discussions with fewer concessions on an exit payment. On Sunday Liam Fox said leaving without an agreement and trading on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms was \"not exactly a nightmare scenario\" but stressed he would prefer to have a deal. The International Trade Secretary also dismissed as \"completely wrong\" suggestions from French president Emmanuel Macron that \"secondary players\" in the UK were \"bluffing\" about the possibility of a no deal outcome. Commenting on behalf of the Open Britain campaign group for close ties with the EU Labour MP Chuka Umunna said: \"Business groups are understandably alarmed by the government\\'s lack of progress in the talks. And the full-blown Cabinet disagreements over how a transition period would work make it even less likely that a deal will be reached. \"No deal would be devastating for business for people\\'s jobs and wages and for national security.\" Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said: \"Uncertainty is toxic for business and is already having a serious effect on investment. \"When the government plays negotiating games by threatening to crash out of Europe it is not taking account of the fact that it is spooking business investors. \"The business lobbies are pleading for clarity and certainty and not getting it. They are hoping for a prolonged transition as part of a negotiated Brexit. But the Government can\\'t and won\\'t focus on that objective let alone what happens after the transition.\" \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Reuters  Britain’s economy is beginning to feel the Brexit pinch or perhaps given the strong performance of the rest of the world economy it should be punch. After a prolonged period of relatively benign economic numbers following last year’s vote to leave the EU there are now signs of a potentially serious slowdown. They stretch from retrenching households to hesitant businesses from a widening trade deficit to lacklustre manufacturing. They also come just as the EU and Britain return to the negotiating table the latter with a handful of new post-Brexit position papers. Since mid-August London has been releasing official papers on issues such as trade customs the European Court of Justice and what the province of Northern Ireland’s future border with EU member Ireland will look like. The performance of Britain’s pound over that period suggests few people were impressed enough with them – or with the likelihood they will come to pass – to overcome the economic signs. Running through the release of five official Brexit papers the pound has lost more than 1.4 per cent against the dollar since August 14 and the euro has gained the same against sterling. While the pound weakness is not directly linked to the papers their release has clearly done nothing to improve confidence in the currency. That is at least in part because the UK economy is starting to feel the impact of Brexit. Economic momentum looks uncertain “Economic momentum looks uncertain. Monthly factory orders this year suggest that the sector is failing to capitalise from a weaker sterling and a pick-up in global trade” Jaisal Pastakia investment manager at Heartwood Investment Management said in note. Elsewhere second quarter economic growth figures showed consumer spending slumping to a two- and-a-half-year low of just 0.1 per cent quarter-on-quarter. Business investment was also at a standstill. Barclays said this was “highlighting just how much businesses are holding back investment in the face of high levels of uncertainty regarding the outlook for business conditions.” Add to that a warning from Britain’s heavyweight food supply industry that EU workers it relies on are already leaving or considering doing so. It is not completely linear of course. Car manufacturing bounced back in July while the unemployment rate is falling. Last month’s purchasing managers indexes also pointed to steady – albeit sluggish – economic growth over the coming months. So the wheels have not come off. But the backdrop for Britain as it returns to the table on Monday is nonetheless a stark contrast to what the other side is experiencing. The eurozone which comprises 19 of what will be the remaining 27 EU members is flying high. The latest data shows annual growth at 2.2 per cent the highest for more than six years; economic sentiment is cruising at levels last seen before the financial crisis and even the bloc’s notoriously high unemployment rate is falling. Improvement is fairly widespread among eurozone countries meanwhile. Florian Hense an economist with Berenberg bank notes the eurozone has now had 17 consecutive quarters of growth. Whether this continues or is peaking may become clearer in the coming week when various sentiment indicators unemployment and manufacturing reports are released. The flash composite purchasing manager index has already shown the bloc to be well in expansion mode with no sign of an August slowdown. Inflation too will be on the agenda. It is expected to be 1.4 per cent year-on-year too far below the European Central Bank’s near two per cent target to impact rates decisions on its own. But the growth picture is enough to have the ECB at least thinking about tapering its quantitative easing bond-buying programme. Some have taken to calling that QExit. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s financial services minister said he would do all he can to ensure that the City of London continues to be a major financial centre after Britain leaves the European Union although thousands of jobs will move to the continent. John Glen told lawmakers that he agreed with Bank of England estimates that 5000 financial services jobs will have moved to continental Europe by the time Britain is due to leave the EU next March. \"My sole objective in respect of the City is to ensure as much continuation as possible in respect of economic value able to be generated by the City\" Glen told a committee in parliament\\'s House of Lords. \"We have not seen wholesale moves of large institutions to other cities in continental Europe\" Glen said. He \"fully expects\" that Britain and the EU will agree on a deal that would introduce a transition period from next March to avoid a disorderly Brexit. \"If there was an unsatisfactory environment for the City of London then we would need to take appropriate action to defend our interests\" Glen said. A no-deal Brexit however might not necessarily be as hostile and difficult as some might anticipate he added. Britain\\'s financial sector generates more than £70 billion in tax revenues with the EU its biggest single export market. Glen said the focus was on securing a bilateral agreement with the EU to inject certainty into the bloc\\'s existing system of financial market access known as equivalence. Equivalence refers to Brussels granting market access to foreign banks and insurers if their home rules are aligned enough with those in force in the bloc. BILATERAL AGREEMENT Britain however wants a bilateral agreement with the EU to avoid Brussels scrapping equivalence at short notice Glen said. \"We cannot be subject to a situation where there is politicisation of equivalence and our financial institutions would be vulnerable\" Glen said. UK and EU financial rules are already fully aligned and a bilateral agreement would set out what happens if either side wanted to diverge from a particular rule he added. \"We need an outcome that satisfies the City.\" While many firms are yet to make firm commitments to move staff they are negotiating options on space in Amsterdam Paris Frankfurt and Dublin that will allow them to quickly scale up said Sophie Van Oosterom chief investment officer for commercial real estate and investment firm CBRE in EMEA. \"We see some tenants putting options on space in other markets\" Van Oosterom told Reuters at the Expo Real meeting in Munich adding this was for typically space for between 20 and 40 employees. \"So if there is a soft Brexit they will stay put and if something dramatic happens they can flick the switch. They are taking optional space that doesn\\'t cost them too much but gives them the ability to grow quickly\" she said. David Hutchings head of Cushman & Wakefield\\'s European investment strategy team said London had been losing some back-office finance jobs to other regions in Britain before the Brexit vote and those jobs may now go elsewhere in the EU.\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

If Brexit talks break down without a deal half of Britons believe the final decision over whether to leave the European Union should be taken by the public in a referendum according to a survey of more than 10000 people published on Friday. The YouGov poll conducted July 31-August 7 and commissioned by the pro-referendum \"People\\'s Vote\" campaign found 45% of voters supported holding a new referendum whatever the outcome of talks with the EU while 34% opposed it. If negotiations with the EU fail to produce a trade deal 50% said the public should vote on whether to leave the bloc anyway while 25% said lawmakers should decide by voting in parliament. \"Across the spectrum the message from voters in this survey is clear: if the government and parliament can’t sort out Brexit the people should\" said Peter Kellner a former president of YouGov. With less than eight months until Britain is due to leave the EU Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to find a plan for future ties that pleases both sides of her divided party and is acceptable to negotiators in Brussels. She has proposed a compromise that would keep Britain in a free trade zone with the EU for manufactured and agricultural goods which would still have to comply with some EU rules. Some in her party want closer ties; others favour a cleaner break. Finance minister Philip Hammond known as a supporter of close EU ties said on Friday that under May\\'s proposal he expected the economy would \"grow at broadly the rate that it would have done had we remained in the European Union\". The treasury has previously forecast that other scenarios all involving a cleaner break would harm growth. \"The chances are that we will get a trade deal I expect that to be the outcome but I recognise that there is a possibility that it doesn\\'t happen\" Hammond told reporters during a visit to central England. Unpopular The YouGov poll showed May\\'s proposal has yet to win popular support with either side. Faced with a three-way choice between remaining in the EU leaving with no deal or accepting May\\'s proposal 40% favoured remaining 27% wanted to leave without a deal and just 11% favoured the deal. London and Brussels seek a final deal in October to give time to ratify it. At the weekend British trade minister Liam Fox said he saw a 60% chance of a \"no-deal\" Brexit which would see the world\\'s fifth-largest economy quit the EU on March 29 2019 without a trade agreement. Sterling slid to its lowest level in more than a year on Friday bringing its loss since Monday to 1.9% on concerns Britain could leave the EU without a deal. May has repeatedly ruled out another public vote on Brexit saying the public spoke at a June 2016 referendum when 51.9% backed leaving and 48.1% wanted to stay. Goldman Sachs said it believed May would clinch a deal on access to EU markets for goods and get it passed by parliament though a disorderly exit remained possible. The YouGov poll found 74% of those questioned believed the negotiations were going badly and 68% thought that made it likely Britain would get a bad deal. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Traders hold a more negative view on the outlook for the pound than at any time since shortly after the Brexit referendum in 2016 according to options markets as fears grow that Britain is headed for a sudden disruptive exit from the European Union. Financial options known as risk reversals - which measure demand for options that give investors the right to sell sterling at a future date versus options that give them the right to buy - show traders are increasingly concerned about the pound tumbling between December and April. Fears of a no-deal Brexit have intensified as talks towards an agreement between London and Brussels over the terms of their divorce hit an impasse. Sterling neared 15-month lows under $1.27 on Tuesday after Standard & Poor\\'s warned Britain it was likely to endure a long recession with a no-deal Brexit. The currency recovered slightly on Wednesday. Even if Britain can agree a deal Prime Minister Theresa May will need to get parliamentary approval - far from guaranteed given her Conservative party lacks a majority and factions within her party oppose her approach. Any delay would leave Britain perilously close to its scheduled EU departure date of March 29.\\xa0Standard & Poor\\'s warned Britain it was likely to endure a long recession with a no-deal Brexit And a parliamentary rejection could plunge Britain into a sudden disruptive exit reaping havoc on the economy as the UK fell back on World Trade Organisation rules for trade with the EU its largest trading partner. Paul O\\'Connor head of the UK multi-asset team at Janus Henderson said any relief for the pound would be short-lived should the EU and Britain agree a deal at a special November summit. The arithmetic did not favour May getting an agreement through parliament he said. A failure at the first attempt would spark weeks of \"acrimonious posturing brinkmanship threats people worrying about a leadership contest general election Jeremy Corbyn\" just as liquidity thinned at year-end he added. Corbyn is leader of the opposition Labour Party. \"So it\\'s quite plausible that we go into Christmas with a first vote failed and the focus of the second attempt being something to look forward into the new year. That\\'s not great\" he said adding that he expected a deal to pass through parliament eventually. There are signs of growing stress in options markets for trading sterling against the euro too. Three-month and six-month risk reversals headed this month towards levels seen in August when bearish sentiment on the pound was at its highest since October 2016. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

A second Brexit referendum would do \"irreparable damage\" to politics and \"break faith\" with the British people Prime Minister Theresa May will say on Monday rejecting what some see as the only way to break an impasse. After a tumultuous week in which she survived a confidence vote and sought last-minute changes to a Brexit agreement reached with Brussels last month May faces deadlock over her deal in the deeply divided British parliament. With the European Union offering little in the way of concessions to win lawmakers over an increasing number of politicians are calling for a second referendum. But May and her ministers have repeatedly ruled out a new ballot saying it would deepen divisions over Britain\\'s biggest decision since World War Two and betray voters who narrowly backed leaving the EU at a 2016 referendum. That increases the risk of Britain leaving without a deal in less than four months a scenario some businesses fear would be catastrophic for the world\\'s fifth largest economy. The political and economic uncertainty over Brexit is having an impact with data on Monday showing a drop in consumer spending falling house prices and growing pessimism in household finances. \"Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum\" May will tell lawmakers according to extracts of her statement released in advance. \"Another vote which would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics because it would say to millions who trusted in democracy that our democracy does not deliver. Another vote which would likely leave us no further forward than the last\" she will say. Business minister Greg Clark said a second vote would only increase uncertainty for the country. May returns to parliament to update lawmakers on Brexit after a week in which she cancelled a vote on her deal because it was set to be defeated and survived an attempt by some of her own lawmakers to oust her. The Labour Party which is under pressure from smaller opposition parties to propose a motion of no confidence against the government this week said on Sunday it would seek to force May to bring the deal back to parliament for a vote before Christmas. May used a visit to Brussels last week to call on EU leaders to offer assurances over the so-called Northern Irish \"backstop\" - an insurance policy to prevent the return of a hard border between the British province and EU-member Ireland that its critics fear will tie Britain to the bloc in the long term. But while EU leaders said they were willing to help May they warned the British prime minister she could not renegotiate the deal agreed earlier this year. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

With just over two weeks to go until Brexit Theresa May has once again failed to get her Brexit deal through parliament leaving complete uncertainty about where the nation goes next. May lost the vote on her deal 391 to 242 a slightly higher level of support than in January but still a resounding defeat for a prime minister who increasingly appears to have lost control. Following the defeat the prime minister confirmed that MPs will now be able to vote on whether to oppose a no-deal Brexit. But she warned that the government would press ahead with planning for a no deal and that MPs would have to acknowledge that their vote does not change EU or UK law. If they fail to make a decision on what to do no deal remains the default on March 29.\\xa0It therefore isn’t clear if extending Article 50 will achieve much more than delaying the inevitable May said this would be a free vote meaning she would not whip her party into voting to support her. In announcing this she noted that “just like the referendum there are strongly held and equally legitimate views on both sides” suggesting that this is another attempt to keep her fragile party together and prevent any more resignations at least in the short term. There will then be a vote on March 14 on whether to extend the Brexit process beyond March 29. But in another warning May said “this does not solve the problems we face”. If MPs vote to extend she said the EU will want to know what they intend to do with that time. Do they want to revoke Article 50 entirely? Do they want to hold a second referendum? At the latter question a large number of MPs cheered – while others shouted “no!”. May added that she also believes there is still a majority for a deal. No one can doubt her tenacity and staying power. While other ministers have been scrambling to save their own careers and distance themselves from the ongoing mess the prime minister has been nothing but persistent. Once again pressure has been mounting on her to resign and although it is doubtful that such an action would really solve anything after her Brexit deal was once again rejected by parliament even May must be asking herself whether it is worth staying on. May’s run as prime minister cannot go into the history books as anything other than a failure. To be fair her inheritance from David Cameron was pretty lousy – a divided party tasked with delivering a major political action that had barely been planned for at all. But the difficulty of this task was compounded by weak leadership a lack of party discipline and numerous bad decisions. Her latest was to try to sell a minor concession from the EU as a last minute victory to try and convince MPs to support her deal. Once again they weren’t buying what she was selling. Backbench MPs continue to stir up trouble from the sidelines refusing to follow the party line and facing minimal repercussions for their disloyalty. May’s loss on this latest vote came after the European Research Group of backbenchers held a meeting in their so-called “star chamber” agreeing to rebel en masse and further suggesting that May has lost control of her party. The fact that May has managed to make her time as PM last nearly three years with all of this going on is pretty impressive. And there are no clear mechanisms to force her to step down if she decides not to. She has shown she can weather votes of no confidence and she is safe from another party leadership challenge until the end of the year. But following this latest rejection of her Brexit deal it is hard to see what she can do next or why she would even want to go to all the effort. Many suspect that May will simply get parliament to vote again hoping that enough MPs will flinch at the last minute and vote for it to avoid a no deal Brexit. But while not as large as her first defeat this loss was significant. And with her rivals once again sensing blood in the water many people probably wouldn’t hold it against her if she just decided to abandon ship like so many before her and get a head start on the lucrative lecturing circuit that has served some of her predecessors so well. We know that the majority of MPs don’t want a no deal but in voting against May’s deal they have made that much more likely. A vote in parliament against a no deal Brexit has no direct effect on the EU and Jean-Claude Juncker has already warned that there will be no third negotiation. It would be foolish to assume that this is not sincere. That all just makes a no deal more not less likely. Taking this into account it therefore isn’t clear if extending Article 50 will achieve much more than delaying the inevitable. Despite constant assurances from prominent Leavers that the EU will see sense at the last minute and give Britain what it wants the remarkable outward unity of the EU has not wavered in the nearly three years since the referendum.\\xa0The remarkable outward unity of the EU has not wavered in the nearly three years since the referendum The fact is that the EU isn’t prepared to give into unrealistic demands from the UK to the detriment of itself. Given that the EU hasn’t seen fit to amend the terms of the deal by now it is hard to see that this will change. The EU will likely grant an extension because it won’t want to be seen as forcing a no deal situation but the fact that an extension into May would likely see Britain having to participate in the next European parliament elections raises issues for both sides. Regardless of how well you think she has done in the job there is little doubting that May has done more or less all she can as prime minister. Delivering Brexit was never going to be an easy task and it has proved all consuming. With other policies failing as a result and her party even more divided it may now be time for her to her to retire from Number 10 and let her critics in the party make good on their claims that they could do it better.

Updated at 6.45pm with Opposition leader\\'s comments \\n Malta wants to be the best UK-friendly country after Brexit Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said on Wednesday as he outlined Malta\\'s preparations in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal. He told a press conference that Malta regretted the UK\\'s departure from the EU and hoped its withdrawal would not be without a deal. Malta agreed with the other EU member states that the exit deal agreed between the UK and the EU (and rejected by the House of Commons last week) should not be reopened. Malta agreed however that the EU should be ready to offer clarifications to avoid a no-deal scenario.\\xa0 Read: Anxious laughter as British nationals ask about no-deal scenario The agreed Brexit deal Dr Muscat he said was a balanced one providing peace of mind for businesses while respecting the principles laid by both sides protecting the single market and ensuring that the Irish border backstop only came into force if there was no alternative. It also allowed a transitory period. The Malta government Cabinet on Tuesday discussed preparations in case there was a no deal Brexit he noted.\\xa0 Around 13000 Britons live in Malta of whom 5000 work here. A large number of Maltese also live in the UK and the Malta government had noted the UK’s safeguards for EU citizens living there. What will happen to British citizens in Malta? As far as possible Malta wanted to see no change in the status and living conditions of Britons already living in Malta the Prime Minister said. As agreed with the UK government they would be required to apply for a residence permit. That permit would give them special status as citizens of a former EU country and their rights would continue to be retained. This residence permit will be valid for 10 years - longer than any other residence permits. It could then be renewed and no charges would be imposed for the permit application. As a result students will be able to continue to study in Malta workers could continue to work here and residents could continue to stay here. “You have nothing to worry about even if there is a no-deal” Dr Muscat said addressing British residents in Malta. Britons who come to live in Malta after Brexit would also have a 10-year residence permit but in their case their rights would be equal to third-country nationals coming to Malta. “They will be charged residence fees currently applicable to non-EU nationals and if they want to work they need an employment licence\" he said.\\xa0 In case of no-deal Brexit Britons living here will continue to vote in local council elections Dr Muscat added. This proviso already existed before Malta joined the EU. What Brexit arrangements will be made in the health sector? Dr Muscat said Malta also wanted to keep good relations with the UK in the health sector. While fewer Maltese now needed hospital treatment abroad some needs remained he said. The Malta-UK health agreement signed in 1975 would remain in place and the Medical Council would introduce a fast-track system to register professionals from the UK. Maltese doctors trained in the UK would be recognised according to existing arrangements. Malta and the UK also intended to mutually recognise each others’ doctors he added. What about imported medicines? Dr Muscat said some stockpiling of UK-imported medicines had already been made where appropriate according to shelf life. Alternative suppliers had also been identified. The Medicines Authority has held talks with importers to ensure there were no shortages or price increases. Some importers had taken proper action while other woke up a bit too late he noted.\\xa0 Will air travel provisions change? A drop in the value of the Sterling\\xa0would make a holiday in Malta more expensive for Britons Dr Muscat acknowledged saying that the\\xa0Tourism Minister was working to ensure that tourist arrival numbers were maintained. The government is considering introducing a preferential track for arrivals from Briton along with EEA and EFTA countries. How will customs procedures change? In the event of a no-deal Brexit customs would have to be imposed immediately on imports from the UK Dr Muscat said. He was pleased with the preparations being made by the Customs Department. Dr Muscat speaks to the press. Photo: DOI/Omar Camilleri In case of a no-deal Customs would have an additional 6000 to 7000 customs declarations to handle ranging from packets with a value of over €22 right up to containers. Simulations showed Customs was ready for the challenge. He said the government was prepared to help exporters mitigate the additional costs of exporting to the UK. Dr Muscat said a Brexit helpline would be introduced in Malta and the UK as from next week and details will be issued in due course. UK businesses attracted to Malta Asked about Malta’s efforts to attract businesses from the UK to Malta Dr Muscat said a number of companies had already opted for co-location. Dr Muscat said Malta had not targeted the large multinationals but instead relatively smaller companies of a few thousand employees. In particular Malta had targeted UK companies with mother companies in the US India and Japan. There would be a “steady flow” of businesses registering in Malta he said. Reacting to media reports that major gaming companies were eyeing a move to Malta Dr Muscat would not get into specific names of companies but said the reports were true. Most market leaders in the sector were already in Malta he said and the feedback the government was receiving was “where will we base our offices” and “where will we send our children”. On this latter point Dr Muscat said a call for a new international school in Mtarfa had already been issued. Loss of ally in taxation talks Asked for his position now that Malta would lose a major ally when it comes to its EU battle on tax harmonisation Dr Muscat told Times of Malta that this would be an uphill struggle for the country. Like-minded member states needed to “man up” and speak out he said.\\xa0 “I think the issue is that for too long many countries have relied on the UK to lead the fight on this issue and this cannot continue” he said. Is Malta prepared for any scenario Delia asks Meanwhile speaking in Parliament on Wednesday evening Opposition leader Adrian Delia asked whether Malta was prepared for any scenario including the possibility of the UK opting for another Brexit referendum. He also said that while the Opposition agreed with the Prime Minister on the living conditions of Britons in Malta he wanted assurances that none of the proposed measures fell short of other EU laws.  The government he went on should also ensure that those Maltese citizens living in the UK are given the same conditions offered to the Britons living in Malta.  “The government should put pressure on the UK government to ensure that it provides Maltese living there the same 10-year window” Dr Delia insisted. He also asked the government to ensure businesses have continuity. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

EU leaders present in Malta this morning are calling for unity across Europe as the union goes through testing times. Speaking at the European People\\'s Party congress Donald Tusk said the key to the future is in the unity and sovereignty of Europe. He warned against \"foolish and dangerous claims\" made under the guise of sovereignty and patriotism. \"We must challenge the populists we must say loud and clear that nationalism and separatism which threatens the EU is the opposite of patriotism. Words such as \\'dignity\\' and \\'pride\\' must return to our political dictionary\" he told those present at the Intercontinental Malta. We must challenge the populists we must say loud and clear that nationalism and separatism which threatens the EU is the opposite of patriotism He said populists are taking advantage of organised hatred and the EU\\'s response must be clear and decisive. Only free and law-abiding societies can truly be safe. Hosted by the Nationalist Party the EPP congress is taking place just hours after the UK triggered off Article 50 paving the way for Britain\\'s exit from the European Union.\\xa0 Antonio Lopez-Istruiz general secretary of the EPP said the EU was united and strong \"to face whatever letters are sent from London or to respond whatever tweets president Trump might direct to us\". \"We are strong and united but we muse listen and reconnect with those who voted for socialists. Extremists and populists will not succeed\" he said.  Outlining a number of struggles including Brexit the economic crisis terrorism attacks and the refugee crisis ministers and heads of states reiterated calls for unity and peace among all states. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said Brexit is not the end of the EU. \"US president Donald Trump was happy that Brexit took place and he is asking other countries to do that. If he continues I will suggest that Ohio and Texas are independent.\" Populism is biggest challenge - Busuttil Nationalist Party leader Simon Busuttil said populism was the biggest challenge faced by the EU.\\xa0 \"The populist promises everything to everybody the populist speaks about problems but never offers solutions. Populists are just interested in votes.\" This was evident after the Brexit vote when the ones campaigning for Britain\\'s exit from the EU came up with no alternatives.\\xa0 Concluding the congress Dr Busuttil said: \"I will do my best to deliver the next EPP government and to deliver the govenrment that the people of Malta truly deserve - and we will leave no stone unturned to get this job done.\" Donald Tusk. Photo: Reuters EPP group chairman Manfred Weber said if the EU wanted to convince people of its unity it must stop the everyday crisis talks which have dominated its agenda. \"Every political era had challenges. We can solve the problems better together. I am 44 and I am the first generation to say I have lived in a peaceful Europe and so do not tell me that this is not a success story.\" He described statements made by Turkish leader Erdogan as unacceptable. \"Turkey cannot become a member of the EU. We should have a partnership but not membership. Do not overstretch the EU\" he told those present. As Britain prepared to leave the EU the bloc cannot allow the \"cherry-picking approach\" it had seen in the past decades. German chancellor Angela Merkel said if Europe wants to protect its external borders it also has to tackle the reasons why people are fleeing. \"The truth is we have looked away when we came to funding camps and that is why we are facing humanitarian disaster and that is why we took refugees in. \"When you fly to Malta and see the blue skies… you see that Africa is on their doorstep. We have to help African states take their fates into their own hands\" she said. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Europe has to emerge stronger from the economic crisis. \"We are the major commercial power in the world. We are the place in the world where people are given best care. Nobody has education and health systems as we do and that is why everyone wants to come to Europe.\" Silvio Berlusconi entering the EPP congress in St Julian\\'s. In the wake of Brexit Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban called for negotiations that were fair and which reflected the EU’s values while Romania Prime Minister Krause Iohannis called for negotiations that were “sustainable”. “It is extremely important that the outcome of negotiations have to have results which are decent and sustainable. The main policies can be towards what can unite us. Avoid more dividing lines. “Romania does not support EU of concentric circles and multiple speeds. It risks division. We do not see this as depending cooperation especially when the\\xa0union is already rife with distrusts” Mr Iohannis said. Buena caminata para comenzar el día.

European Union Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Wednesday an agreement with Britain could be \"within reach\" next week calling for decisive progress in the talks in time for a summit of all 28 EU leaders. Negotiators from both sides have been locked in talks this week to overcome differences on the biggest outstanding hurdle to a deal - how to keep the UK frontier with the Irish republic free of border checks after Britain leaves the EU in March. Barnier told small business leaders that the talks were \"continuing intensively this week day and night with the aim ... of having a deal within reach if we follow through to the end of this negotiations on Oct. 17.\" Leaders of the 27 countries that will remain in the EU meet in Brussels on Oct. 17 a day before British Prime Minister Theresa May joins the summit. Barnier reiterated that as much as 85 percent of a withdrawal agreement had already been agreed boosting the pound on financial markets. Policing of the deal and agreeing rules on produce such as camembert cheese and Parma ham that is protected inside the EU against imitations from elsewhere needed more polishing he added. He also stressed the EU\\'s insistence that Britain must accept possible checks on goods moving between its mainland and its province of Northern Ireland saying Brexit will trigger the need for customs value-added tax and compliance checks with EU standards. Both sides want to avoid a return to checkpoints on the Irish border as this would hinder trade and risk reigniting violence in the province two decades after a peace deal. Barnier said customs forms could be completed in advance online and the \"only visible systematic checks\" would involve scanning bar codes on lorries or containers on ferries or in ports. For industrial goods he said it could be done by \"market surveillance authorities\" in company premises but he added that checks on animals and animal-derived products would still have to take place on the border. \"Our challenge is to make sure that these procedures are as easy as possible and not burdensome\" he said in his speech in the European Parliament which ended with a standing ovation. However a small Northern Irish party which supports May\\'s minority government in the Westminster parliament vehemently opposes any checks between the province and the rest of Britain. Barnier said he realised such checks were politically difficult but this was the consequence of Britons voting to leave the EU. He reiterated the EU\\'s line welcoming May\\'s proposals for a bold free-trade deal \"without tariffs or quotas\" and close security ties after Brexit. But he stuck to the EU\\'s rejection of London\\'s plan for a \"regulatory framework for goods\" saying it would give Britain an unfair competitive advantage by allowing access to parts of the bloc\\'s single market without ensuring the country honours all of its conditions. \"DAY AND NIGHT\" TALKS The 27 EU states will get an update on the negotiations at a meeting of national ambassadors without Britain on Friday evening. The sides will continue negotiations through the weekend with hopes for a breakthrough as early as Monday. The 27 EU leaders meeting next Wednesday in Brussels want to be able to announce \"decisive progress\" on the Brexit deal to agree to hold another summit in November. That would be to finalise work on a declaration of close future ties with Britain that would also be part of the Brexit package. Both the EU and Britain have signalled progress in recent days boosting sentiment in financial markets which fear the most damaging no-deal Brexit. Barnier said the cost of such a development would be \"very high\" for Britain but also some sectors of the EU economy such as the car industry. \"That is why the no-deal is not and has never been our (preferred) scenario even if our responsibility is to be prepared\" he said. The European Commission also looked at preparations among the 27 states for multiple disruptions that this would involve including customs checks and duties kicking in immediately on all imports and exports. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain is expected to keep the door open for European Union banks and investors after Brexit to try to preserve London\\'s global financial clout irrespective of whether it gets a good trade deal from the bloc bankers and industry officials say. Nerves in the City of London financial district were rattled last month when the UK government proposed future financial services trade with the EU based on \"reciprocal\" arrangements. Bankers worried this meant that if the EU did not give Britain broad market access London would impose tit-for-tat restrictions on EU banks or even tighten up treatment of all foreign lenders. \"But the Treasury later told us it does not mean that. Reciprocity would make the City very nervous\" a senior international banker in London said speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. The Treasury had no immediate comment on Tuesday. At stake is one of the most liberal and lucrative financial services trade regimes in the world. \"The City has grown up by being everyone\\'s playground and that needs to continue. The White Paper was not to be read as limiting market access coming into the UK\" said a senior financial sector official referring to the government\\'s Brexit plan published last month. Britain allows non-EU \"third country\" banks to operate as a wholesale - but not retail - branch in London meaning it doesn\\'t require costly capital cushions that subsidiaries have. It also allows overseas entities to offer a wholesale service without a permanent UK base subject to some conditions. \"The UK\\'s approach to third country firms may be regarded as one of the main factors which have made it one of the world\\'s leading financial centres\" said a European Parliament study on Brexit. LEVERAGE Bankers are waiting to see how EU bank branches in Britain and UK branches in the EU will be treated in future under any trade agreement or no deal scenario. UK policymakers say Britain should get good terms because the bloc needs City expertise to manage £1.2 trillion of assets for EU investors issue bonds and float new companies. The bloc is also slow to create its own capital markets union to substitute the City and many EU companies don\\'t want hikes in costs from fragmented markets policymakers say.\\xa0No matter how difficult the EU may be in respect of UK firms trying to do business there Britain has no choice but to stick with open borders But 43 per cent of UK international and wholesale financial services revenue comes from the EU the sector\\'s biggest export market and worth £26 billion. Deutsche Bank estimates that Britain\\'s current account deficit would be 40 per cent higher without this. In a sign of UK caution consultants advised regulators to put their open approach to foreign banks into question as a negotiating tactic but the government did not want to do that a senior financial official said. The Treasury said in a June paper that if there was no transition deal to smooth the Brexit process after the official departure day in March 2019 then as a general principle Britain would default to treating EU states largely as it does other third countries. But there are instances where \"we would need to diverge from this approach\" it said without elaborating. It is due to publish a new paper on no-deal contingency plans shortly. The EU has also said it will treat Britain like other third countries. \"The EU has not given any indication that it won\\'t allow UK banks to establish branches in the bloc\" said Vishal Vedi Deloitte\\'s financial services Brexit leader. NO TIT FOR TAT In another sign of pragmatism Britain has proposed a \"temporary permissions regime\" to allow EU banks and insurers with branches in London to continue operating after March for three years if there is no transition period. The EU has not reciprocated for UK bank branches in the bloc but is urging lenders in the City to gets licences for their European hubs. Andrew Bailey head of Britain\\'s Financial Conduct Authority says a key question is whether EU customers will be allowed to continue doing business in London after Brexit. France has taken a tough stance on City access to the bloc. \"The FCA\\'s optimal position is open access but if we can\\'t get that what does the UK do?\" said Jonathan Herbst a financial services lawyer at Norton Rose Fulbright. Britain will also be under pressure to respond if Brussels rejects its calls to ease up the EU\\'s \"equivalence\" rules for market access used by Japan and the United States. The rules give some market access to third-country firms if their home regulators have equivalent policies to those used in the EU. The equivalence rules have also been put into UK law and in theory Britain could apply them against the bloc in retaliation. But no matter how difficult the EU may be in respect of UK firms trying to do business there Britain has no choice but to stick with open borders said Simon Gleeson a financial services lawyer at Clifford Chance. \"There is no way the UK can go for tit-for-tat. What the UK can\\'t do is maintain openness for Americans and impose restrictions on Europeans. The only leverage we have is that if you cut off access to us you are hurting yourself \" he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

As members of Parliament gather in Britain\\'s parliament on Tuesday to vote on the future of the country\\'s relationship with Europe traders in London\\'s financial hub will be bracing for a potential burst of market turmoil that could affect the Brexit process itself. Sterling plunged more than 10 per cent in the immediate aftermath of Britain\\'s shock vote to leave the European Union in June 2016 while £1.57 trillion was wiped off global stock markets. This time traders expect a more muted response. Prime Minister Theresa May is widely expected to fail in her attempt to win support for her Brexit plan meaning the immediate market reaction could be limited - unless there is a surprise. But as her failure would usher in yet more uncertainty over the Brexit process big market swings may follow - and some commentators have suggested heavy market losses could even convince MPs to back May if she tried for a second vote. \"On the morning after the 2016 referendum result the London Stock Exchange kind of broke because there were such wide spreads on stocks market makers weren\\'t finding prices\" said Laith Khalaf senior analyst at Britain\\'s biggest direct investment service Hargreaves Lansdown. \"We are less likely to see turmoil like that as people are ready for a range of outcomes this time but we could see some big swings\" he said. Either way banks and brokerages will be prepared. Barclays Investec JPMorgan and Nomura are among banks in London planning to draft in traders and analysts outside of normal business hours on Tuesday sources familiar with the matter said as they prepare for an influx of calls from investors keen to understand or make bets on the implications of the vote. With the result not expected to become clear until around 1900 GMT London\\'s stock exchange will be closed meaning it will be sterling - traded 24 hours a day around the world - that will react first. \"We’re preparing for the big day and night by bringing sleeping bags into the office and have mini golf and pinball in our break out area so we can keep the traders busy during any quieter hours\" said Samuel Leach CEO of Samuel & Co. Trading. Nomura has booked hotel rooms in the city a bank spokesman said for bleary-eyed traders to use if necessary after a night that could set the future for the £2.8 trillion British economy for generations. \"We are going to be glued to our trading screens or television wherever we are\" said Neil Jones head of hedge fund foreign exchange sales at Mizuho another Japanese bank in London. WORLD WATCHING It is not just in London where traders will be gripped by the Brexit vote with less than four months to go before Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29. In foreign exchange hubs like New York Hong Kong and Tokyo traders will watch for signs of May\\'s deal being voted through - seen as indicating an orderly Brexit and therefore positive for sterling - or rejected signalling more uncertainty. \"If we see it becomes a true volatility event then the ability to step away from the desk will be challenged. Of course arrangements will be made to feed the troops and no doubt there will be a few ales after to unwind\" said Chris Weston head of research at currency broker Pepperstone in Melbourne. Traders will be focussed on helping investor and corporate clients with what each development in the vote means for them. \"This is an exciting market event and it’s intriguing to see what will happen but it’s important to remember for our clients that it’s the opposite of that – some of the scenarios could be very painful for businesses” said Jonathan Pryor head of foreign exchange sales at Investec in London. May\\'s compromise Brexit deal has dismayed both supporters of a more decisive break with the EU and those who want ties to remain as close as possible. Her reliance for a majority in parliament on a Northern Irish party that opposes the deal has made her position even more precarious. Should she defy the odds analysts say shares in sectors most directly exposed to the British economy such as banks insurers homebuilders and retailers could surge. Such an outcome could also boost sterling which could hurt FTSE-100 companies that primarily earn revenues in dollars such as HSBC and BP. If May fails however it could send shockwaves through a financial industry that has been hoping Britain would move into a transitional deal with the EU until the end of 2020. \"This vote is a lightning-rod realisation for some clients that two years of ministerial resignations chit-chat and speculation comes down to this: in three months we could be crashing out of Europe\" said Matthew Hudson CEO of MJ Hudson which advises more than 600 institutional and retail investment firms. Defeat for May could see asset managers immediately move to open offices in Europe to ensure continued access to EU markets in the absence of a deal with the bloc Hudson said. \"I\\'ve got clients who are ready to push the button the minute she loses\" he said. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British Prime Minister Theresa May began a tour of the United Kingdom to drum up support for her Brexit divorce deal with the European Union while her deputy said on Tuesday parliament might reject it if asked to vote on it now. May has warned sceptical lawmakers that if they reject the deal then the world\\'s fifth largest economy will either leave without an agreement or Brexit could be delayed or even reversed. The vote in parliament is scheduled for Dec. 11. Amid demands from British lawmakers for May to seek a better deal from the EU a step Brussels has said it will not countenance her de-facto deputy David Lidington told Sky News: \"If the vote were today it would be a difficult one to win but I think that we have time between now and (Dec. 11) to make the case.\" In a separate interview with the BBC Lidington the cabinet office minister said it was \"wishful thinking\" on the part of some lawmakers that the EU would offer an alternative plan if parliament rejected the deal. \"There\\'s no plan B because the European Union itself is saying the deal that is on the table is the one that we have had to compromise over\" he said. May sealed a deal with EU leaders on Sunday that would see Britain leave the bloc on March 29 with continued close ties but now faces an uphill struggle to get it approved by a divided parliament where lawmakers of all parties and on both sides of the Brexit debate have criticised it. May will travel to Northern Ireland and Wales on Tuesday as part of a tour aimed at rallying support for the deal. DOOMED DEAL? May faced further censure on Brexit from the United States where President Donald Trump said the EU got a good deal that may make trade between Washington and London more difficult. \"I think we have to take a look seriously whether or not the UK is allowed to trade\" Trump said. \"Because right now if you look at the deal they may not be able to trade with us ... And that wouldn\\'t be a good thing. I don\\'t think they meant that.\" May\\'s office said the deal would allow the UK to sign trade deals with countries throughout the world and it had begun laying the groundwork for an agreement with the United States. Such is the pressure on her leadership that The Times newspaper reported some Brexit-supporting lawmakers in May\\'s Conservative Party were demanding that she set out when she will quit as a condition for supporting the deal. May has 314 active Conservative lawmakers in the 650-seat House of Commons and would need around 320 votes to ratify the deal. Even one of her allies former defence secretary Michael Fallon said on Tuesday he could not support it. Fallon who resigned last year after a journalist accused him of sexual harassment told BBC radio negotiators should head back to Brussels to secure a better agreement even if this meant postponing the leaving date for two or three months. \"My fear is that this deal gives us the worst of all worlds. No guarantee of smooth trade in the future and no ability to reduce the tariffs that we need to conclude trade deals with the rest of the world\" Fallon said adding unless parliament could be persuaded those things were possible \"the deal is doomed\". Amid such uncertainty some lawmakers are calling for Britain\\'s exit to be delayed or even cancelled. At a hearing in a case supporters of membership hope could pave the way to a second referendum and ultimately stop Brexit Europe\\'s top court was told on Tuesday that Britain can unilaterally reverse its decision to leave the EU. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain published proposals Wednesday for EU immigration curbs after Brexit as business groups warned the UK economy was not ready for the country to crash out of the bloc with no divorce deal in place. The proposals include a temporary work visa system similar to \"guest worker\" systems in other countries as well as a consultation on a salary threshold for workers who would be allowed to settle in Britain.\\xa0In the future everyone other than British and Irish citizens will need to get UK permission before they can come here The European Union also on Wednesday said it was adopting backup plans in case of a no-deal Brexit while Prime Minister Theresa May faced another barrage of criticism in parliament for delaying a critical vote on her withdrawal deal. Labour opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn accused May of \"recklessly running down the clock\" by seeking to ensure that MPs only have a choice between her deal and no-deal when parliament will be allowed to vote next month. \"She is holding parliament and the country to ransom\" he said accusing her of a \"criminal waste of money\" with stepped-up no deal contingency planning. Corbyn was later upbraided by Conservative MPs who said he had muttered \"stupid woman\" at May when she mocked him over his indecision and was asked to apologise to parliament.  But a Labour spokesman said Corbyn had said \"stupid people\". Need for \\'sustainable\\' immigration May has vowed to end free movement of people from Europe saying that this was one of the main reasons that Britons voted to leave the European Union in a 2016 referendum. Immigration levels have already fallen since the referendum. Net migration to Britain was around 280000 last year a decrease from levels of more than 300000 in 2014 and 2015. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said visas would be introduced for EU nationals arriving to live in Britain after Brexit. The new system will be based on skills not nationality putting EU and non-EU\\xa0citizens on the same footing. \"In the future everyone other than British and Irish citizens will need to get UK permission before they can come here\" he told lawmakers. The proposals include one-year visas for workers of any skill level that are aimed at protecting sectors of the economy that are reliant on lower skilled labour. While in Britain these temporary workers would not be entitled to access public funds or bring in dependant family members or seek permanent settlement. There would also be a \"cooling-off period\" prohibiting them from renewing their visa for a year. \"The future system is about making sure immigration works in the best interests of the UK\" Javid added noting it would \"bring annual net migration down to more sustainable levels\". During prime minister\\'s questions May said her government remained committed to a long-held goal of bringing it down to tens of thousands annually. Javid said the proposals \"will give protection to British workers\" and \"help drive up wages and productivity across our economy\". \\'Misguided\\' approach The interior minister did not detail the level of the annual salary threshold - a highly contested proposal - but said it could be \"£30000 (€33000) or thereabouts\". He said the threshold could be lowered to encourage foreign students to stay and work in the UK and for certain parts of the economy in which a labour shortage could be proven.\\xa0The annual salary threshold - a highly contested proposal - could be \"£30000 (€33000) or thereabouts\" The immigration proposals are aimed at winning over Brexit hardliners who have resisted voting in favour of the deal that May has struck with EU leaders. But they will cause anger in parts of Britain such as London that have benefited from EU immigration. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the government\\'s approach was \"misguided\" and \"risks doing profound damage to growth jobs and communities across London and the UK\". Meanwhile the political deadlock in Westminster has raised the prospects of either a second referendum or of a no-deal Brexit when the negotiating time runs out on March 29 next year. After the British government outlined Tuesday its no-deal contingency planning the European Commission said Wednesday it was acting \"to ensure that the necessary measures can enter into application on March 30 2019\". Its package would \"limit the most significant damage\" caused by such a scenario and covers 14 areas where a \"no-deal\" Brexit \"would create major disruption for citizens and businesses.\" They include financial services air transport customs and climate policy. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

British ministers are divided over the government\\'s next steps if Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit deal with the European Union is not approved by parliament next month. With just under 100 days until Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29 deep divisions in parliament have raised the chances of leaving without a deal and increased calls for a second referendum to break the deadlock. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said late on Wednesday there would be a \"plausible argument\" for another referendum if parliament failed to reach a consensus on the way forward something May has repeatedly ruled out. House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said a so-called people\\'s vote would be unacceptable and that a \"managed\" no-deal would be an alternative. \"A managed no-deal would simply mean that it was agreed on both sides that there would be bilateral arrangements that we would have some forms of mitigation\" Leadsom told Sky News. \"That would be possible should it come to that.\" May pulled a vote on her deal from parliament earlier this month after admitting it would be defeated. She is seeking \"assurances\" from EU leaders over the so-called Irish backstop an insurance policy to avoid a hard border between the British province and EU-member Ireland that its critics fear will trap Britain in a customs union with the EU indefinitely. May\\'s spokesman said a second referendum was not plausible and that the EU had been a clear a \"managed\" no-deal was not available. The prime minister was focused on getting the assurances parliament wants on the backstop he said. \"The EU has been very clear that there is no withdrawal agreement available which does not include a backstop\" he said. \"The best mitigation against the \\'no-deal\\' is passing the prime minister\\'s deal.\" Leadsom said the government intends and expects to get May\\'s deal through parliament when it brings it back for a vote in mid-January. Leadsom later told parliament that several days of debate ahead of that vote would begin on January 9. May has repeatedly said that if her deal is rejected then the world\\'s fifth-largest economy might have to leave without a deal - the nightmare option for big business - or that Brexit might be thwarted altogether. The government said on Thursday it had reached agreements with Norway Iceland Liechtenstein and Switzerland which mirrored elements of its exit deal with the EU on issues such as citizens\\' rights. PLAUSIBLE ARGUMENT Some ministers have indicated they would quit the government if the no-deal option became official policy. Earlier this week the government said it would implement plans for a no-deal Brexit in full and begin telling businesses and citizens to prepare. With no clear majority in parliament for any way forward several ministers have said they would support the idea of holding an \"indicative vote\" of lawmakers as to what Brexit option they would like to see pursued. Rudd said parliament should reach a majority on how Britain leaves the EU but if it could not then another referendum was an option. \"I have said that I don\\'t want a people\\'s vote or a referendum in general but if parliament absolutely failed to reach a consensus I could see there would be a plausible argument for it\" she told ITV. France\\'s European Affairs Minister Nathalie Loiseau said Britain could hold a second Brexit referendum. \"The door remains open but it will be up to them to choose not us\" Loiseau said. Russian President Vladimir Putin who some British lawmakers have accused of meddling in the referendum vote said on Thursday that May had little choice but to implement Brexit and steer clear of a second referendum because not doing so would undermine faith in British democracy. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Britain\\'s Prime Minister Theresa May heads back to meet EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday as she seeks a way to avoid a no deal Brexit in 50 days time. Expectations for the visit were already modest when on Wednesday EU kingpins Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker torched May\\'s prospects of winning changes to the withdrawal agreement. The president of the European Commission Juncker told reporters May already knows and accepts that the Union will not re-open talks on the deal. And Tusk who represents EU member governments as head of the European Council triggered outrage across the Channel by damning pro-Brexit politicians for -- in his view -- recklessly failing to plan.\\xa0 \"I\\'ve been wondering what that special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely\" Tusk said. Juncker at a later news conference did not use the same language but cheerfully laughed off Tusk\\'s remark. But he also repeated the same warning that the withdrawal agreement and the backstop clause designed to keep the Irish border open if no future trade deal is agreed will not be changed.\\xa0 \"She knows that the commission is not prepared to reopen the issue\" Juncker said after talks with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar who also insisted on the need for the backstop. - \\'Don\\'t gamble with peace\\' -This apparently united front did not daunt Number 10 who insisted that the British parliament\\'s rejection of the deal meant that May must seek material changes to the accord or see it fail. According to talking points provided by Downing Street ahead of the visit May will admit that: \"Securing such changes will not be easy.\" But she will add: \"Last week Parliament made clear that for the first time it could support the withdrawal agreement subject to changes to the backstop.\\xa0 \"The Government now wants urgently to work with the EU to secure such changes. The EU shares the UK\\'s commitment to leave with a deal. We must show determination and do what it takes to now get the deal over the line.\" The impasse in Brussels has led to heightened fears Britain could crash out of the EU without a deal on March 29 disrupting trade and supplies to manufacturing. Tusk and Juncker said they look forward to hosting May on Thursday and Varadkar will have dinner with her in Dublin on Friday. Offering warm support for his Irish guest Tusk said the European Union \"will not gamble with peace\" on the Irish border by removing the backstop from the deal. \"I hope that tomorrow we will hear from Prime Minister May a realistic suggestion on how to end the impasse\" he said. But he added: \"A sense of responsibility also tells us to prepare for a possible fiasco.\" - Painstaking talks -Varadkar whose government has stressed the importance of maintaining an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit thanked Tusk. \"While we expect the backstop will never be used we agreed again today it is needed as a legal guarantee to ensure there is no return to a hard border\" he said. On Wednesday May discussed the issue with Northern Irish leaders in the British province. Last month the House of Commons overwhelmingly rejected the Brexit deal that May had negotiated with the EU after 18 months of painstaking diplomacy. May is now looking into changes to satisfy her MPs who fear the backstop would keep Britain indefinitely tied to EU rules with even closer alignment for Northern Ireland. May\\'s spokesman stressed that she wasn\\'t coming to Brussels to ask for more time and remained determined to deliver a Brexit deal before the March 29 deadline.\\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Scotland wanted to stay in the European Union’s single market after the United Kingdom leaves the bloc and would push for more powers to protect its interests the head of its pro-independence government said yesterday. “We are determined to maintain Scotland’s current position in the European single market” First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in a paper setting out Scotland’s views about Brexit. Britons voted to leave the EU by 52 to 48 per cent but Scotland one of the UK’s four nations voted to stay. “There has to be a way to effectively square the circle (between the two results). Will this be easy? No ... but I believe this is achievable” she told a news conference. “First and foremost this is about us trying to convince the UK that these are proposals worthy of being considered. “We believe our practical solutions are reasonable and in the best interests of Scotland – in a context that will be complex and unprecedented whatever the ultimate outcome.” Sturgeon said the option of independence which Scots rejected in 2014 had to be kept available and that she wanted to remain a full member of the EU. “The option of independence must remain on the table” Sturgeon said. “Brexit is a problem not of Scotland’s making.” Scotland she said needed a fundamental review of its devolution settlement and that powers over immigration were vital to protect Scotland’s interests. Scotland wants control of its own migration policy to shore up its ageing population and its more sparsely populated rural territory north of the English border. But Scotland’s wish list is a difficult one to satisfy. While allowing free migration may be a priority for Scotland curbing it has been set as a priority by Prime Minister Theresa May. In London May’s spokes-man said the Prime Minister would carefully consider the Scottish proposals. But he added: “Our position is there shouldn’t be a second (independence) referendum. There was a referendum it was only two years ago; the result was very decisive (and) both parties agreed to abide by the result.” \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

In a statement the company said the first six months of this year saw passenger numbers rise by 195574 compared to\\xa0the same period last year an increase of 9.8 per cent. MIA CEO Alan Borg said this increase was even more significant as the growth was registered in both\\xa0peak and shoulder months in line with the country's strategy to promote Malta as a year-round\\xa0destination. “The growth we've witnessed in the first six months has encouraged us to revise our original forecast for the\\xa0year announced in January. We are taking into consideration our performance so far traffic development for\\xa0the upcoming season and prevalent factors that shape the aviation environment” said Mr Borg. During June MIA registered an increase of 6.8% in passenger movements continuing with\\xa0the positive trends observed during the first five months of the year. This growth was stimulated by an increase in seat capacity and airlines’ increased efficiency in filling up these\\xa0available seats. Seat load factor (SLF) for the period between January and June reached 80 per cent\\xa0while seat capacity grew by 7.4%. Malta’s top market remained the UK with 612413 passenger movements in the first six months of 2016\\xa0followed by Italy (459657) and Germany (274954). Mr Borg today said he is not expecting any short-term effects on passenger number in the wake of last month’s Brexit vote. He said the fall of the British pound had made travelling to Malta 10 per cent more expensive than it previously was.\\xa0This impact may be offset by people who would previously opt for long-haul flights instead choosing to fly to Malta. In the long-term Mr Borg said he is not expecting a major regulatory impact in the aviation market once Britain leaves the EU. The markets that registered the\\xa0largest growth were Turkey (37%) and Switzerland (36.4%) following the introduction of more frequent\\xa0flights leaving Malta International Airport to Istanbul and Zurich and Geneva respectively.\\xa0MIA said it invested significantly in the passenger experience this year including the embellishment of the security area new x-ray machines more signage liftreplacements washroom refurbishment and a new food court amongst others. Tourism Minister Edward Zammit Lewis said the government is working on developing new source markets which is of particular importance after the Brexit vote. \\xa0 \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Photo: Phil Noble/Reuters  Britain’s government needs to speed up its decision-making on big infrastructure projects to help the country’s economy withstand a slowdown caused by the Brexit vote a leading employers’ group said yesterday. The British Chamber of Commerce cut its forecasts for economic growth in 2016 to 1.8 per cent from a previous estimate of 2.2 per cent and it also downgraded its 2017 and 2018 growth forecasts to one per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively. “They [the government] should start with the long list of business-boosting infrastructure projects that have been put on hold for far too long – including a firm decision on a new airport runway new nuclear investment and road and rail schemes” BCC acting director general Adam Marshall said. Finance minister Philip Hammond said last week that big infrastructure projects would take too long to deliver an economic impact to feature in budget plans he will announce in November but he said he could fund more modest projects if needed. The prospect of a recession caused by Britain’s decision to leave the EU has receded after a rebound in economic data for August including a pick-up in consumer confidence. But there are signs from companies of longer-term drags on the economy. The BCC said it expected business investment to fall by 2.2 per cent in 2016 and by 3.4 per cent in 2017 a sharp turnaround from its previous forecasts for rises of 4.5 per cent and 7.4 per cent respectively. A separate analysis by accountancy firm BDO also called for more infrastructure investment and said businesses were starting to regain their confidence after a dip following the EU referendum. The BDO Optimism Index rebounded to 98.7 in August from a three-year low of 97.9 in July. The index calculated using business and central bank survey data indicates recessionary conditions at 95 and two per cent long-term growth at 100. Separately on Monday credit card firm Visa said its UK Consumer Spending Index suggested overall consumer spending growth rose by just 0.1 per cent in August compared with July its slowest increase in almost three years. The index jumped by 1.6 per cent in July when official data also showed consumers spent heavily despite the Brexit vote. Official data for retail sales in August are due on Thursday. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Airlines such as Ryanair and rival Easyjet have urged the British government to put aviation at the front of the queue when negotiating its EU exit because they need to finalise their 2019 summer schedules in the first half of next year. Airlines based in the EU have the right to fly to from and within any country in the bloc thanks to the single aviation market created in the 1990s meaning Britain has just two years to renegotiate access or come up with an alternative system. “Ryanair is pivoting its growth away from the UK” finance director Neil Sorahan told reporters in London adding that the airline had planned to grow by about 15 per cent in the UK last year but had instead posted growth of about six per cent. “Brexit will inevitably lead to a slowdown in growth in the UK. We haven’t seen it yet but we believe it will lead to a slowdown in growth in both the UK and the EU as both parties have to deal with a completely new scenario.” Sorahan added that the growth may slow more sharply as the country gets closer to the end of the two-year divorce process unless the government can provide greater certainty as to how airlines will be able to operate in the future. He added that the airline had not yet decided whether it would try to secure a British air operating licence and could instead cut its flights within Britain which account for around two per cent of its business. He said a decision would be made over the next 12 months. Easyjet has said it is close to applying for a licence to set up an operating company within the EU to protect its intra-EU flights. Its headquarters and listing will remain in Britain however. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.

Half of Britons support a second vote on whether to leave the European Union and a third said they would be worse off financially outside the world\\'s largest trading bloc according to a new opinion poll. The poll published in the Mail on Sunday newspaper found 50% of people supported another vote on the final terms of Britain\\'s exit deal 34% rejected another referendum and 16% said they did not know. The newspaper said it was the first major opinion poll since last week\\'s media reports that Britain is preparing to pay about €50 billion to help to pave the way for talks on a future trade pact with the EU. Since the referendum in 2016 high profile opponents of Britain’s exit - from French President Emmanuel Macron to former British prime minister Tony Blair and billionaire investor George Soros - have suggested Britain could change its mind The poll found 35% of those surveyed said they would be worse off financially after Brexit while 14% said they would be better off. The online poll carried out by research firm Survation interviewed 1003 adults in Britain between November 30 and December 1. Mike Smithson an election analyst who runs the www.politicalbetting.com website and a former Liberal Democrat politician said on Twitter it was \"the first time any pollster has recorded backing\" for a second Brexit referendum. Since the referendum in 2016 high profile opponents of Britain’s exit - from French President Emmanuel Macron to former British prime minister Tony Blair and billionaire investor George Soros - have suggested Britain could change its mind and avoid what they say will be disastrous for the British economy. Blair said what the government was seeking to negotiate was not possible Blair told the BBC on Sunday that Britain could change its mind about leaving the EU. \"It\\'s reversible. It\\'s not done until it\\'s done\" he said. Blair said what the government was seeking to negotiate was not possible. \"They are trying to negotiate getting out of the single market while recreating all of its benefits\" Blair said. \"That\\'s not going to happen.\" Survation said it carries out polls for media organisations including the BBC Sky News the Daily Telegraph and the Guardian. \\nmore Careers »  \\nMar 19th 09:06  \\nSubscribe to gain access to our premium content and services.
