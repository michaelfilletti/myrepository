# Work Projects

- Basic Baybets Report:
Initially only two KPIs were used within the Baybets portfolio, this rose to at least 24 within 9 months, by extracting more data, applying automation and introducing player data.

- Data ETL Automation (Baybets/Catena):
Using Python to query the Google Sheets API to extract and transform data into a useful manner to load into Power BI.

- Deal Machine (Baybets/Catena):
The Deal Machine is a tool that is used to evaluate the strength of current RevShare/CPA deals with operators by forecasting revenues and retention. It is used to identify any potential optimizations to increase revenues.

- Monthly Player Dashboard (Baybets/Catena):
Illustrates various player related stats to help the company identify most profitable operators, retention rates and quality of players.

- Uniblue Typical Funnel:
While at Uniblue I worked a lot on funnels and identifying any potential drops or increases in our funnel, to help the business identify any issues or potential bottlenecks.
